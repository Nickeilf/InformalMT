There are two possibilities .
Either you like to read , or you don &apos;t read .
If you like to read you will always find something nice , and if you don &apos;t like to read it , it &apos;s not very serious there are lots of other hobbies nice !
You can &apos;t recommend a reading to &quot; come from a lack of intellectual reflections &quot; .
It &apos;s by reading books that you like you will make your little reflections .
Well good we don &apos;t know your tastes either , according to the title you quoted you like the SF , read from the SF my guy !
I think that many &quot; women &quot; find this cool ( on the other hand we appreciate the way you call us female especially in Italy ) .

&gt; The blockchain makes it possible to do without this trustworthy , in the vast majority of cases , it &apos;s not useful so using a blockchain rather than a good video DB is simply waste .
Except that it requires your blockchain to be enough distributed to have a third of confidence and to prevent minors from changing it .
First option : A public blockchain , but I doubt that even Ethermm will support all the flow of carrouf chickens .
The other option is a private blockchain with why not minors who do not have to be a teacher of work but being annoyed by a central authority and there anyway there is the same problem of confidence .
You have a good concept of Askreddit , there &apos;s a karma to be done .

No , I &apos;ve already said that the _ Donald was unbelievable : ) Then , on the level of hatred and bulging , there is a equivalence between the left and the right .

Vladimir test and I think he should find it quickly .
Otherwise , what will be the next step .
Problems organized everywhere , the Crimea war ( officially Russia doesn &apos;t participate , but Vladimir distributing medals has soldiers who were in front ) , we let it go and the hashkers Russian are fucking the shit ( the off account of Macron , the mails .... ) .

Are you in favor or against ?
72 % favorable / 28 % opposed &gt; &gt; To oppose the reform of the SNCF , unions plan to organize a reelection strike .
Does it seem justified or unjustified ?
63 % unjustified / 37 % justified &gt; &gt; The Air France unions are demanding a general salary increase of 6 % and calling for a strike day on March 23 .
Do you have their legitimate claims ?
64 % no / 35 % yes / 1 % NPS &gt; &gt; Do you think these movements of unions could lead to a complete blockage as in 1995 ?
50 % no / 49 % yes / 1 % NPS

The game changes constantly , personally I love it a lot , so I &apos;m going to do the best .
&gt; Moche They do a lot to develop this point at the moment , quite a lot of things have changed , and they are preparing to change all of the models of character ( so all animations , armies etc , not the choice ) .
&gt; not interesting story . I &apos;ll leave you alone judge , I didn &apos;t care about it , but I had good feedback yet .
&gt; The argument that made me want to try it is the huge &quot; talent &quot; that allows to build the bunch that we freely want .
Except that by looking at the forums , we realize that if we want to reach the lady game , you need a bunch opti right from the beginning , and the respé is so relaxed that it is advisable to go back a new personally .
Since the levying is annoying , no thanks .
First of all , I don &apos;t know when you tried the game , but the lump up has changed much ( we went to do three times the four meters with difficulties with ten acts to do once , by personally , this said ) .
Then , it &apos;s true that in order to go far enough , we can &apos;t go to the pie .
But there is a lot of buds able to do all the content ( actually , with investment , almost everything ) .
The internet guys are not always very fair , or easy to reach for a deal , but there are things to do quite simple and very nice to play .
Then , you need to be ready to learn a lot to play freely , it &apos;s very dense , not very easy .
By the way , I come to your last point , even if it &apos;s a poison now , it must be said that it &apos;s a horror to start .
And on the flasks , you have to look at them like full sorts , and unless I misunderstood what you say , there is not really alchemist , and the classy who is the most bastard is hyper pleasant .
( and the video you put , it looks hyper to play , I confirm ) .
After all his taste , but I had to do a bit of promoting the game !
I was talking from a technical point of view ( the scientific approach , how to bring experiences ) because yes , then , there is no report .

An anti-transvestite brigade is rife in our streets &gt; Emboring a person who is a person ( whether qualified or not ) does not pose any problem if she has values compatible with the work that asked her .
If only the DHR were not subject to the needs of companies eh !
The societal debate is a risk for companies and it &apos;s therefore generally not by default ( &quot; why take the risk &quot; is the default solution ) , in the same way that people obviously homeless are generally seen as problematic , why take the risk when you can just tell them that they don &apos;t match the company &apos;s expectations ?
A modern company demands standard people who will provoke as much as possible , it facilitate the integration into the company to take &quot; standard &quot; employees ( it does not excludes minorities while they &apos;re discreet ) so why can we add a potential problem ?
Discrimination is very annoying and risky for a private company , so avoid the problem when hiring .
Edit : And for the &quot; &#91; ... &#93; shouldn &apos;t hope to find a job ... &quot; you don &apos;t worry they can always work for Uber / Deliveroo , it &apos;s not a job where the employer is watching when the liability of her employees .
It leaves a chance for the bullshit who served his 10 years and who decided to further betray the rules of society but it also leaves the door open to the most virulent , a few that is their political / societal orientation .
The final balance sheet I can &apos;t judge but there is everywhere and it &apos;s not bad ( some will not agree , ok ) .
Uh the Slavah defense is an opening of failure .

Ah it &apos;s not yet a complete series ?
I had this series in 5th ( it &apos;s been over 15 years old ) , through a friend who preaches me the tome 1 in English .
After about twenty minutes on the first page , I abandoned .
Nothing funny but nothing horribly dramatic ; over 80 years old , to die at the house at a time when we &apos;re still being well right and with all his head , after an honest and well-filled life , it &apos;s not far from ideal , I think .
Of course , it &apos;s very hard for his family , and didn &apos;t be able to go to me for the funeral , so I write a letter of condolences .
It &apos;s possible to measure this discrepancy ( for example : 13 seconds per month ) and to configure the PC to regularly re-settle the clock with the opposite discrepancy .
Of course it &apos;s terribly geek , and of course it is planned under Linux and not under Windows .
The &quot; hwclckin &quot; programme and the configuration file &quot; / etc / adjtimein serve that . &quot;
And of course with the omnipresent networks and NTP , all of this is not very used .

It &apos;s your guy , he &apos;s a minor , you do what you want .
It &apos;s you who are the legal guardian , you have the right to tell them to go and eat crap at the Touches .
If you &apos;ve already said politely and kindly and the debthem don &apos;t print , you &apos;re going to your top .
You always say nice , but firmly , no , you don &apos;t let them take photo , or you get from your house .
Even once it &apos;s enough to pass the message .
The problem of families with people like &quot; The Touches &quot; ( so almost all families ) , it &apos;s that you can &apos;t PAS send a nice message .
They are in their trip and if you say something you &apos;ll be the service of service , and you &apos;ll be ignored .

It doesn &apos;t leave a lot of time to be educated on the dietetic , to study glycaics , the influence of such a nut on health and take time to look at the nutrition contributions of each product rather than directly tracing the promotion radius .
1 - The US administration has only to get a bunch of balls and punish the owners of the big distribution if they try to transmit the cost of regulation to the purchase price of their products . ( improbable )
If we talk about rising prices on diesetically disadvised products , I see it as an idea to develop .
A dietary tax could even be used to tax bad products and reduce the price of healthy products .
2a - By following your logic , you can almost say that all the regulation on copes packages is useless because everyone knows that it &apos;s a cancer .
3 - We can also just imagine that in the long term , a better nurtured population will be more happy , productive , and better , and that all this will be financially less on the rest of society .

And automatic vakation of the semester when blockages prevent classes for several weeks .
More seriously , because I was starting to bitch too much on the rote of the troll , I will not call it a trial of intent just a point of vigilance in the measure or a post ( of frenec-murder ) asked me because he &apos;s confusing T. Ramadan , Muslims in general and plot theory .
And all this applauded by high votes , of course .
So obviously it deserves correction , in my way , but correction .
We can practice his faith , not know T. Ramadan , and refute any theory of conspiracy .
Same it kills me to see the number of Redditor bringing that back to railway workers , strikes or jokes on Trump ...
Check about the quebecois mentality
We &apos;re starting to be a good gang !
It &apos;s like a Fesfo meeting .
I thought that the French thought they were superior . And only 73 % admit it .
The French are false modest ...
Should it make him a double face .
No , in truth , bikes can also surprise that .
It &apos;s also for that that they have reserved lanes , and if not , a little carte to prevent pedestrians : I use it and abuse when I go around bike , some think it &apos;s to say &quot; release &quot; whereas in fact it &apos;s to say &quot; attention , bike , I saw you , but not you &quot; .
So the bikes , silent , have to be heard by pedestrians .
Without jobs , you &apos;re less in the market ( because the recruiter knows that you lose money if you don &apos;t accept ) .
If it &apos;s good to negotiate 4 months it &apos;s perfectly possible ( especially with a move ) .
Or else negotiate two weeks of unsolicited leave using your previous employer &apos;s leave balance is also possible .
Typically , when he asks your disappointments you put on the table the fact that you have X notice of notice + .
Yeah , finally , it &apos;s also the excuse of the Americans that to get rid of Clinton and the democrats for missing their campaign ... the fact is , many troubles voted like some trouble .
Faced with the CRIF , Macron refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . Given the star , it does more satano-athique .
It really tears up the race of its mother your comment .
Already replied , you need to read the comments and watch the videos until the end .
&gt; I admit , a guy who screw &quot; dirty fascist &quot; may actually be a Mussolini admirer himself .
Congratulations therefore showed publicly that you don &apos;t know what antifa means .
&gt; It &apos;s not a mirror , it &apos;s especially the inconsistency of your part .
Ok , you don &apos;t know what to say incoherence than antifa .
&gt; It &apos;s not they who fire them , they ask their friends SO or cops to fire them .
Antifas threaten physical violence , it &apos;s different .
And nothing allows you to assert with certainty that these are antifa .
I have the impression that you are party to people who think that this torch is making you a process .
Sorry to tell you , it doesn &apos;t work like that .
&gt; You should really watch the video .
We &apos;re going to give you that you know yourself as a comic of repeating ;
If it &apos;s done now , you need to look at the documents you have consulted with what you obviously have not understood .
Sorry the fascist connection of a Manager does not make you an antifa .
It takes time to digest a name .
Also , what &apos;s funny is that the new names are sometimes tested on family animals .
( sorry for the defender of the animal cause ) Think about Max or Isis .
This video , and this channel in general deserves your time .

The post that only gets upvotes is because it isn &apos;t too strong on the majority of the sub ( EM and center left ) , while it is low-effort , cried out of mistakes , and mockery .
Well no , the FN and the UPR are parties , so you need a card to be a real member of it .
There , there is literally nothing like a limit .
The NPA , however , I admit I don &apos;t know myself , but I doubt that many want to hurt him .
I will be in France for a month .
What cities should I visit ?
Versailles ( his house at least ) .
At least a Château of the Loire ( Champagne ? ) .
Brittany is clearly forgotten in your list while it &apos;s shit .
Don &apos;t go to Nancy , honestly it &apos;s sad to die .
The fact that it is based on gold makes it independent of the monetary system based on &quot; artisanette &quot; ( the QE , the bank &apos;s printing of central banks ) and especially the dollar , whose value depends on the oil market ( not enough US gold to guarantee the value of the currency ) .
Even conspiracy that with the CFA franc ... &gt; 2- the fact that a 2011 report precisely , coming from the IMF ( under the presidency of DSK ) , which more or less confirms the viability of this alternative currency , represents a risk for the US dollar , based mainly on oil transactions ( they don &apos;t have enough gold to sufficiently cover the cash in circulation ) .
Big risk for the dollar / s .... ah , well , if you &apos;re really serious , you &apos;re answering yourself &quot; Dollar &quot; &gt; We now know that Syria came after , and that it was going to be a big piece .
ALELELIHA &gt; In any case , if there is one thing I &apos;m sure of , it was that the war in Libya of Sarkosy was not in the interests of the French or France , but in his own and that of his &quot; clan &quot; .
You will make the point to the families of the 56 French people who died in the Libyan State attack , to the Bulgarian doctor and nurses too .... : ) I am sure that putting an end to a European regime or national is tortured and raped , it &apos;s not in our interest / S

Taxation of GAFA : a tax &quot; between 2 % and 6 % &quot; according to Le Maire .

You need to follow the discussion too , we &apos;ve said that 2 % of CA for the GPs is 10 % tax rates , CE QE TT THES PE .
For the rest , investors &apos; flight ... what are you talking about ?

We &apos;re not going to continue like that .
You &apos;re making yourself a pathetic app on the name of the pupil it sends a sm saying that it &apos;s a big thing !

Perder 40 % of your income is a nice leg when you touch an SMIC , beyond it is just unsustainable if you want to maintain your standard of living !

For me , at the beginning , we need to get rid of 1 heroes of typical cops ( DPS / SUP / TANK ) and then take a feedback hero that you manage rather well in every class as well .

We should do a sub just to insult them without knowing it .

How would you place bloodboin compared to dS3 ?
I think my friend is subscribed to PS plus that would make us a good sequel , since we almost finished dS3 .
It &apos;s still cook to hear the FI question the independence of all the media ( held by the 9 millionaires ) while journalists have no ideological or political links with their owner and claim that the Media is completely independent of the FI .

How to eat at the time of the French and like the French ?
Already we need to eat at noon .
A real meal , not a sandwich on the chicken .
It &apos;s preferable that the main meta is the one at noon , not the one in the evening , contrary to what we usually do to do .
With a real meal in the stomach , you will be less hungry or less early .
Then nothing prevents you from taking a meeting at 16h or 17h .
At worst you &apos;re not even taking a small , light case at 6 : 00 when going home like 1 or 2 biscuits .
Not to cut off hunger and the risk is to awaken your appetite and too much ( and badly ) to eat at this time .
The quality of food also influences a lot on the feeling of satisummer .
Preventing fat and protein in the Gludes allows not to be hungry for longer .

Ah yes , interesting to me , I think I &apos;m sure I will test all of this .
Do you order them where your business in general ?
In his cartons I found &quot; the wife &apos;s book &quot; , with a manuscrite note in the form of markmarks &quot; to read in full and before marriage if possible &quot; .
I thought that the content could be collector , I don &apos;t doubt what point .
It amused me very much at the beginning and then I read on one of the Catholics sites that still sell this book : &quot; Pierre Duhome ( pseudom of the Father René Boisfreeze , S.J. , 1898-1959 ) .
Do we get a shitty ?
Not long ago they were looking for Ousama lol
The moderators chose to take inspiration from the French rules which , in my opinion , are better to maintain a calm debate and avoid all wanting to kill each other .

And cables , we all need cable needs .
In fact privatization started late in the 1980s , after a period of fraud ( that &apos;s the country of the yakuza , we must not forget ) and a decrease in the number of passengers ( crisis forces ) .
So the government decided to start privatization by creating semi-private companies by regions ( 6 ) .
But still having your hand on it .
By the way , it was early in 2000 that some became total private ( not all ! ) .
But in the end you have the JR group that owns the 6 companies .
So you have a semblance of competition , but * in fine * is the same company .
And then the Ministry of the Territory , Infrastructure , Transports and Tourism still have its word to say .
Japan is quite special because you always have a semblance of competition and privatization but the state is never really far .
Whether voluntarily or involuntary because politicians are * very * friends with big companies .
&gt; It &apos;s always my problem , the people who take their kids to protest .
And those who take their kids to mass ?
I don &apos;t wanted to &quot; attack &quot; by saying that it &apos;s not adult to be like that .
I suppose it &apos;s a question of preference .
I agree with the rebellion on the other hand .
Except that he greeted gold in cooking , the temperates , things don &apos;t do , as far as the cooking is concerned , the epies don &apos;t melt and how to make their flavor out ?

Is there a consensus among the French population on immigration ?
The media are pro immigration yes .
I differentiate the &quot; I have the right &quot; = I can ask and do it , it &apos;s not forbidden ( and the person in front also has the right to refuse by elsewhere ) and the &quot; It &apos;s my right &quot; under which my constitutional right is heard .
In general , a pro-IVG feminist committed rather tend to hear the second case of her place the word &quot; right &quot; in her sentence .
I &apos;m not leaving the benefit of doubt but I still have the impression that they often marry the right word when you talk about IVG as if it wanted to convince that it was really a constitutional right .

It &apos;s the problem of life in society .

Culinaire question : How do you heat up Putin &apos;s stay ?
A little fresh cheese added on a poutine before warm it to the oven ( or mini ooois , it &apos;s faster ) helps the final taste .

It may be an idea .
Frankly , it &apos;s not the easiest thing to heat up without a high quality of quality , but in any case the mini-oven is much better than the microwave ( yark ) .

The 1 is better : always the five same heroes , but everyone has 3 specializations ( most of the time DPS CAC , DPS distance and tank ) , each specialization is characterized by an active skills ( a dash , a zone of zone , a specific distance ... ) and a passive capacity ( sped over 3 enemies at the same time , with constant pv over duration , reduction of degates ... ) .
Moreover , you unblock talent ( specific to each specialization ) all the five levels around us .

Iiiish , the title of this article .
When you put his quote in context , there &apos;s really nothing to be offended in it : &quot; I never hesitate to express myself at the same time in French , or in the language of the host country , or also in English when they are on international scenes or in front of business , because I think it reinforces the French-speaking .
It &apos;s very stupid as a title .
feminist Campaign .
Daniel Schneiderman is in front of his screen .
He is preparing to watch a courteous , excellent and intelligent show produced by his new favorite medium .
When suddenly , one of the invites allows themselves to issue a brazen hypothesis .
Attack , confused , shocked that it happens on a leftist media , Daniel Schneiderman takes his social justice suit . Warrior .
He denies a editorial .
Who is this woman who dares to talk about women &apos;s bodies , March 8 , in the context of a show that could not avoid the hashtag MeToo ( not Balance your Porc , I let you guess why , you have 2h ) ?
Who is this perfidious who suddenly deviates from the usual cops ?
Would it be a sent from the Maaaaaal ?
Super-Schneiderman investigation for us !
And yes , poor poor leftists who only wanted to confirm your bias : a person hides behind Maranne Durano .
Who ?
The Maaaaaaal in no one has infiltrated on our happy shelf .
How ?
They are therefore only one and the same person , one and the same idea , no autonomy of thought is possible .
On March 8 , a woman hides another one .
She neither hides Paul Piicetta the director of the drafting , nor Pierre Chausse , the director of the publishing , nor Gauyesterday Bès , the deputy director , nor Fabriice Hadjadj nor Olivier Rey the design advisers , nor any of the other members .
It does not replace Foucald , which she repeats the theories .
No , she replaces epochal Eugenie Basty because she has the merit of being unknown to the battalion .
It would never have been invited , she is not left wing , but we &apos;re sure she would have said exactly the same .
In the interests of journalistic objectivity , with an undeniable taste for the contradictory debate , Daniel Schneiderman is doing justice to women by throwing out his camouflaged stuff .
Thanks to Daniel Schneiderman for this great advance in the day after March 8 .
Thanks for this relentless fight for freedom of expression and pluralism in the media .
