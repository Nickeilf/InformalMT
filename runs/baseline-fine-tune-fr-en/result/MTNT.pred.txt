You can &apos;t recommend a reading to &quot; come from a lack of intellectual reflec@@ tions &quot; .

First option : A public block@@ chain , but I doubt that even E@@ ther@@ m@@ m will support all the flow of car@@ rou@@ f ch@@ ick@@ ens .
The other option is a private block@@ chain with why not minors who do not have to be a teacher of work but being anno@@ yed by a central authority and there anyway there is the same problem of confidence .

The game changes constantly , personally I love it a lot , so I &apos;@@ m going to do the best .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Mo@@ che They do a lot to develop this point at the moment , quite a lot of things have changed , and they are preparing to change all of the models of character ( so all anim@@ ations , arm@@ ies etc , not the choice ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; not interesting story . I &apos;@@ ll leave you alone judge , I di@@ dn &apos;t care about it , but I had good feedback yet .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The argument that made me want to try it is the huge &quot; talent &quot; that allows to build the bun@@ ch that we freely want .
Ex@@ cep@@ t that by looking at the forums , we realize that if we want to reach the lad@@ y game , you need a bun@@ ch op@@ ti right from the beginning , and the res@@ p@@ é is so rela@@ xed that it is advisable to go back a new personally .
Since the le@@ v@@ ying is anno@@ ying , no thanks .
First of all , I don &apos;t know when you tried the game , but the l@@ ump up has changed much ( we went to do three times the four me@@ ters with difficulties with ten acts to do once , by personally , this said ) .
Then , it &apos;s true that in order to go far enough , we can &apos;t go to the pi@@ e .
But there is a lot of bu@@ ds able to do all the content ( actually , with investment , almost everything ) .
The internet gu@@ ys are not always very fair , or easy to reach for a deal , but there are things to do quite simple and very nice to play .
Then , you need to be ready to learn a lot to play freely , it &apos;s very den@@ se , not very easy .
By the way , I come to your last point , even if it &apos;s a po@@ ison now , it must be said that it &apos;s a horror to start .
And on the fl@@ as@@ ks , you have to look at them like full sor@@ ts , and unless I mis@@ understood what you say , there is not really al@@ chem@@ ist , and the cl@@ ass@@ y who is the most b@@ ast@@ ard is hy@@ per pleasant .
( and the video you put , it looks hy@@ per to play , I confirm ) .
After all his taste , but I had to do a bit of promoting the game !
I was talking from a technical point of view ( the scientific approach , how to bring experiences ) because yes , then , there is no report .
But by cu@@ ri@@ osity I want you to explain the different experiences too ( if it &apos;s not too long ) .
That doesn &apos;t know anything because it &apos;s precisely ed@@ ited <unk> He also kidn@@ apped T _ D on the front page because it did not correspond with his political opinions .
I apolo@@ gi@@ ze , but your source is a bit biased
I prefer the agreement in the past personally .
What are the magaz@@ ines , sites , reference ch@@ ann@@ els on the French / Fren@@ ch-@@ speaking school ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s reference but I like Go@@ tag@@ a , Sk@@ y@@ ro@@ z , M@@ ill@@ en@@ ium , O@@ ser@@ v Especially about For@@ t@@ ni@@ tis ma@@ a .
An anti-@@ trans@@ ves@@ ti@@ te bri@@ g@@ ade is ri@@ fe in our streets &@@ g@@ t@@ ; Em@@ b@@ oring a person who is a person ( whether qualified or not ) does not pose any problem if she has values compatible with the work that asked her .
If only the D@@ HR were not subject to the needs of companies e@@ h !
The socie@@ tal debate is a risk for companies and it &apos;s therefore generally not by default ( &quot; why take the risk &quot; is the default solution ) , in the same way that people obviously hom@@ eless are generally seen as problematic , why take the risk when you can just tell them that they don &apos;t match the company &apos;s expectations ?
A modern company demands standard people who will provoke as much as possible , it facilitate the integration into the company to take &quot; standard &quot; employees ( it does not excludes minorities while they &apos;@@ re discre@@ et ) so why can we add a potential problem ?
Dis@@ crimin@@ ation is very anno@@ ying and risky for a private company , so avoid the problem when hi@@ ring .
Ed@@ it : And for the &quot; &#91; ... &#93; shoul@@ dn &apos;t hope to find a job ... &quot; you don &apos;t worry they can always work for U@@ ber / De@@ li@@ ver@@ o@@ o , it &apos;s not a job where the employer is watching when the liability of her employees .
It leaves a chance for the bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it who served his 10 years and who decided to further betra@@ y the rules of society but it also leaves the door open to the most vir@@ ulent , a few that is their political / socie@@ tal orientation .
The final balance sheet I can &apos;t judge but there is everywhere and it &apos;s not bad ( some will not agree , ok ) .
U@@ h the S@@ la@@ v@@ ah defense is an opening of failure .

How to eat at the time of the French and like the French ?
Already we need to eat at noon .
A real meal , not a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich on the chic@@ ken .
It &apos;s preferable that the main me@@ ta is the one at noon , not the one in the evening , contrary to what we usually do to do .
With a real meal in the st@@ om@@ ach , you will be less hungry or less early .
Then nothing prevents you from taking a meeting at 16@@ h or 17@@ h .
At worst you &apos;@@ re not even taking a small , light case at 6 : 00 when going home like 1 or 2 b@@ is@@ cu@@ its .
Not to cut off hunger and the risk is to awa@@ ken your appe@@ ti@@ te and too much ( and badly ) to eat at this time .
The quality of food also influ@@ ences a lot on the feeling of sa@@ ti@@ summer .
P@@ reven@@ ting fat and protein in the G@@ lu@@ des allows not to be hungry for longer .

In fact privatization started late in the 1980s , after a period of fraud ( that &apos;s the country of the y@@ ak@@ u@@ za , we must not forget ) and a decrease in the number of passengers ( crisis forces ) .
So the government decided to start privatization by creating semi-@@ private companies by regions ( 6 ) .
But still having your hand on it .
By the way , it was early in 2000 that some became total private ( not all ! ) .
But in the end you have the J@@ R group that own@@ s the 6 companies .
So you have a s@@ emb@@ l@@ ance of competition , but * in fi@@ ne * is the same company .
And then the Ministry of the Territ@@ ory , In@@ fra@@ structure , Trans@@ ports and T@@ our@@ ism still have its word to say .
Japan is quite special because you always have a s@@ emb@@ l@@ ance of competition and privatization but the state is never really far .
Whether voluntarily or invol@@ un@@ tary because politicians are * very * friends with big companies .
