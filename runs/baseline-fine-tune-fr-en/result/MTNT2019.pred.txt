I had only one working experience , in a thri@@ ft , I had to rec@@ reate and make orders for the staff , almost all of the time I was putting pressure on myself and I did not have the right to stop ( even after working 6-@@ 7 hours in a row ) before finishing all the orders and deli@@ veries .
At first it was co@@ ol but hard , I was happy to do something else for once that stay at home , as well I was earning the money and it made me sport so it was all well .
When one day one of my colleagues with whom I was working and who I was working for , what would I say ?
T@@ ry on foot to make orders committed a mis@@ cel@@ le .
He and I never heard despite my multiple attempts ( to share the tasks ) .
At the end of the day , there were several orders and we also had to make an inven@@ tory of the fri@@ go , so I tell him that I agree to make an inven@@ tory of the fri@@ dge if he does the rest of the orders .
He agrees .
I &apos;@@ m finishing the work and going back home .
Next Monday , I &apos;@@ m called to say that there is a big problem that the orders that should have been made have not been made .
They find that my colleague had &quot; forgotten &quot; to do his job , except that instead of ad@@ mitting him , he rejected the blame on me , I at the beginning di@@ dn &apos;t really understand what was going on , I was asked to go to emergency , in 15 minutes it was settled .
Then I was told in a ro@@ yal calm , that everything was my fault and I &apos;@@ m dismissed .
I &apos;@@ m not particularly looking to fight , ( the ho@@ tel was in judicial recovery ) , I had a plane ticket scheduled for 1 month to break this island for 6 months , so it was moving a bit and left me time to move .
Nevertheless , I always have this betra@@ yal in my thro@@ at , and for a first job experiment it &apos;s really bad that it is over like that .
The we@@ t dream of L@@ RE@@ M is realized .
W@@ a@@ ah , tell me that I am like Sch@@ i@@ app@@ a ?

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Well , no because once again , you ignore the historical context of the thing voluntarily , that is , a few thousand years of injustice between men / women and a culture that is still mach@@ ist .
You can &apos;t make a law , a rule , without context .
C@@ ome a &quot; white &quot; one that &apos;s the same , you &apos;@@ ll forget a few centuries of slavery of black people .
Your reasoning is not biased in fact , it &apos;s dis@@ honest , because you voluntarily refuse to take into account the reality of today &apos;s society and its historical foundations because they &apos;@@ re not promoting your reasoning .
And you ignore the historical context of gender segreg@@ ation to advocating segreg@@ ation as the only solution to the problem we talk about .
And do you blame me for extra@@ pol@@ ating ?
You &apos;@@ re completely un@@ familiar with other solutions , pre@@ tending to regret this because the situation makes it necessary .
But on an application that knows the identity of all stakeholders , who can know their position , who notes them , who gets the comments of the clients , etc .
Do you really believe that there is really no solution than segreg@@ ation ?
And when I propose the port of arms , you don &apos;t pretend to oppose it for ideological reasons , like me , I oppose segreg@@ ation for ideological reasons , but because it is forbidden .
But sexual discrimination is also forbidden !
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; G@@ o , let &apos;s be cra@@ zy , propose .
Because there , so that you stop telling you about this one , the solution is that B@@ la@@ B@@ la@@ i is proposing the same thing to men , which will serve to serve as a d@@ ull and do not make any progress at all , but will solve your problem .
This point shows that you don &apos;t read mine .
I don &apos;t want any &quot; man &quot; .
I don &apos;t want discrimination .
Like N@@ elson Man@@ de@@ la did not want power to black people against wh@@ ites , he wanted the end of racism .
You think so much by little company that you don &apos;t realize that you can defend individuals .
It &apos;s not because of fear of clashes with men that I am against it , it &apos;s because of fear of clashes everyone .
Increas@@ ing discrimination between men and women in the 2 sense , prejudice , c@@ lic@@ h@@ és , cultural differences that explain differences in access to power .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; So if it happens , a &quot; U@@ ber femin@@ ine &quot; , in the state , it might be fu@@ n ( Ed@@ it : I specify : unfortunately , because no , fundamentally I &apos;@@ m not too much for this kind of thing , I was just making an observation that the simple fact that this measure is made shows that the basic problem is real ) .
A@@ h well , there would be a lot of it .
The gender c@@ lic@@ h@@ és have so im@@ bu@@ ed society .
You know that there would probably also be strong demand for women &apos;s doctors for women , for sports rooms reserved for women , for c@@ af@@ és reserved for women , shops reserved for women , etc .
Is that what you want ?

What we won &apos;t remember : crimes of aggression against physical person , aggression against the forces of order , voluntary violence , the destruction of public fur@@ nit@@ ure , cou@@ ps and injuries exist .
That the blatant crime is admissible as proof .
That the judge can already ordered pre-emp@@ tive arrests if evidence of con@@ spir@@ acy of violent violence is made , like an appeal on Fac@@ e@@ book , thanks to all the arsen@@ al of the state of emergency that has integrated into the law .
So what is the need for this new , extremely liber@@ tarian , authoritarian and dictatorial law to stop the c@@ ass@@ ers ?
When such a law prevents the freedom to protest without order of a judge , when the procedural recourse can only be exercised with the assistance of a lawyer post post so that a judge ass@@ esses the correc@@ tness of the measure , that the so-called appeal can last years with presum@@ ption of guilt in the meantime , when such a law hin@@ ders individual liberties , who can support it ?

You say that a carbon tax won &apos;t work because the population would reject it .
Il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation , y@@ el@@ low bel@@ ts .
So my question is : when do you make such an affir@@ mation , is it bad faith or ignorance ?
Mac@@ ron tax the poor and re@@ distribu@@ ts the rich .
It &apos;s strictly the opposite of that the consensus says to do .
It &apos;s not because Mac@@ ron says it &apos;s a carbon tax that it is .
So , your &quot; knowledge &quot; in economics did not allow you to see Mac@@ ron &apos;s fi@@ le ?
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance ?
Or else you know very well the y@@ el@@ low na@@ ils do not oppose the carbon tax as described by the consensus but you pretend to confuse the two in any bad faith ?

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; tell me if you find an effective political entity somewhere that comes up in less than two months .
You transform the question .
I di@@ dn &apos;t ask for what is a political movement .
Just that they learn to protest in the legality , without provo@@ king a break , that they learn to clean their cl@@ ass@@ rooms who mud@@ dy their message .
Then , if you really want to talk about political movement , even if it makes me hurt to do the job , you have to recognize that they went fast .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Especially since because of politics , it &apos;s what I &apos;@@ ve explained , it &apos;s a movement that has created itself in the mistrust of representation .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; We reap the will of our political classes to limit democracy to the vote .
representation is not the result of the wishes of current policies .
It goes back much further and it is difficult to circum@@ vent for a country of the size of France .
And especially the maintenance of the traditional operation of the 5@@ th re@@ public was privileged by the majority of French people who had the opportunity to vote for a candidate who proposed an opening to a 6@@ th re@@ public with less representation , professional assemb@@ lies , etc ... ( not perfect , but the least worst candidates in my opinion ) .
So no , if we &apos;@@ re still in the same system ( sh@@ it , we agree ) it &apos;s because of a people &apos;s choice .
It &apos;s chil@@ dish to put the blame on the policies .
Where then you have to explain why rather than acc@@ using .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; police forces must respect a gradu@@ ated response and not aim for the head .
We agree on this , and there are some bad elements in the police who may have done it .
But I sincerely think that in such a confusion you can find yourself tou@@ ching the high part of someone without being aiming for this place .
And it &apos;s true that there will be la@@ is@@ se@@ urs for the police and that it &apos;s not normal .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The police work is also to protect the population and also the one that manife@@ sts .
Can she really protect the G@@ J &apos;s G@@ J if the protests are not declared ?
What do they give him the means to do the job they ask him ?
Is there not a certain complac@@ ency on the G@@ J with regard to the as@@ c@@ endants and a desire to break with the forces of order ?
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; They destroyed social dialogue .
That &apos;s the as@@ sho@@ le who down@@ votes me just because he doesn &apos;t agree with me .
We can obviously not even argue his point of view on an an@@ onymous forum without being si@@ len@@ ced by the first gu@@ y who does not support his question .

C@@ Q@@ F@@ D <unk> <unk>
It always depends on how much people are looking for .
A poor &quot; tor + V@@ P@@ N + bit@@ coin obtained via gi@@ f@@ t@@ car@@ ds bought by intermedi@@ ary &quot; will largely be enough for the average gu@@ y or gu@@ y who wants to buy drugs on the internet .
But a real an@@ onymous an@@ onym@@ ity amounts to leading a double life , a lot of money and time , and the slightest mistake can make you j@@ ump .
No , there is not .
G@@ et your hand in a l@@ as@@ er u@@ v , it &apos;s cold and you will have cancer in 5 minutes .
Because the solar radi@@ on@@ na@@ u@@ x is high , it &apos;s hot ... there are u@@ v u@@ v , but it &apos;s decou@@ pled .
The average French who does ski is just as cra@@ zy as canc@@ erous at the end of the day , and yet he di@@ dn &apos;t get warm .
First , I &apos;@@ m not very off@@ ended .
I simply think it &apos;s lack of sensitivity towards the victims and especially their family .
My indignation is more about the author of the images who wanted to make money with , I imagine .
I can only specul@@ ate on his real motives .
You can imagine having tra@@ gically lost one or loved ones and seeing pictures in a fic@@ tion work .
Not a reconstruction of so-called events to the news , not a docu@@ mentary , not a film on the subject but something completely de@@ t@@ ached .
People who give psychological and moral support to survi@@ v@@ ors always advise to avoid news news for several weeks .
There are too big events to avoid them completely , like 11 September mentioned earlier .
The families of the victims of 9 / 11 di@@ dn &apos;t watch * F@@ light 93 * , nor the French docu@@ mentary on fire@@ men , nor the film with Ni@@ c C@@ age , etc .
But if we used images of tow@@ ers that sc@@ ared into a mo@@ vi@@ e on the apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic , they would be right to feel violated or insul@@ ted .
For the Bir@@ d Bo@@ x case , is it a sequ@@ ence of what , barely 2 seconds , and again ?
But it &apos;s a bad trigger for someone who has lost his family in a mon@@ ster accident and tries to dis@@ sec@@ t himself with a good suspen@@ se of horror so that in the middle of the mo@@ vi@@ e he can see the explo@@ sions that took his wife or his children or his friends ...
The problem is that fic@@ tion par@@ es@@ se makes gest@@ ures in@@ sensitive to their producers .
It &apos;s not easy to make an explo@@ sion of this intensity and it costs an arm .
Why not take a true ?
Well , maybe &quot; because people died there &quot; could weigh a bit more in the balance .
No , clearly .
It must be said that it &apos;s mostly popular with extreme right-wing nationalist parties .
What like other parties for a fre@@ x@@ it ?

I &apos;@@ m going beyond your reflection .
I don &apos;t care about people &apos;s ideas .
I think it &apos;s legitimate to have a fear against the immigration of people from other continents with other cultures and how to see the world .
It is even normal to see this from wild people , it &apos;s a completely human reaction to preservation .
What is not like you or familiar awa@@ ken a fear , a cu@@ ri@@ osity seeing a rejection .
Especially when he can see some of the problems related to immigration ( the examples he gives ) .
I find it legitimate for a population to have fears about immigration .
And I find it less legitimate to make fu@@ n of it .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; These are not arguments , it &apos;s ma@@ pping .
He repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats and repe@@ ats again , once again , when something anno@@ ys him , makes it express not to understand what bo@@ thers him for the sole purpose of ma@@ pping out a message .
Sometimes he has interesting arguments .
And he is interested in a subject that is close to him .
We do not judge people who regularly post on ec@@ ology for example , even though they hold them to heart .
After sh@@ it , the debates are something else , everyone can interpret things differently .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; He repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats again and repe@@ ats &#91; ... &#93; for the sole purpose of ma@@ pping out a message .
A@@ h , please , another xenophobic gir@@ l@@ friend !
Un@@ believ@@ able , you multi@@ ply yourself !
We must fear the big replacement ? &quot; .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; It &apos;s like the pu@@ b .
When you say , repeat , that in such a store it is cheaper , that there is such a reduction , etc . ; it &apos;s not arguments .
The goal of the message is not to be an argument .
The goal is to exist , and to occupy space .
Here we can agree .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; There &apos;s no background .
There is nothing other than the expression of a deep hatred of those he identified as foreigners .
I think there is a background .
He thinks that immigration is not something that he thinks is stupid .
So he tries to draw attention to what seems important to him and the negative side .
Not on that he has a problem with people in particular ( like a more French immigrant than French ) but with the principle of multi-@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , demo@@ graphy , religion .
In truth , I know nothing but it speaks to me in this sense .
I &apos;@@ m going back a quot@@ ation that I saw one day on the forum to support my first point ( fortunately I remember the author &apos;s name ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The oldest attitude , and which is probably based on solid psychological foundations since it tends to re@@ appear at home when we are in an unexpected situation , is to completely repu@@ di@@ ate cultural forms : moral , religious , social , a@@ the@@ istic , which are the most remote from those we identify with .
&quot; wild wild &quot; , &quot; it &apos;s not at home &quot; , &quot; we shoul@@ dn &apos;t allow it &quot; , etc ... , so many gross reactions that reflect this same f@@ uc@@ king , this same re@@ pul@@ sion in the presence of ways to live , believe or think who are foreign .
So anti@@ qu@@ ity was confusing everything that was not part of Greek ( then go@@ -@@ Roman ) culture under the same name of bar@@ b@@ arians ; western civili@@ zation then used the term wild in the same direction .
However , behind these ep@@ i@@ the@@ ts is hiding the same judgment : it is probable that the barbaric word refers e@@ y@@ mo@@ logically to the confusion and in@@ articul@@ ation of birds birds , which are opposed to the meaning value of human language ; and wild , which means &quot; forest , &quot; also mentions a kind of animal life as opposed to human culture .
&#91; ... &#93; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; This attitude of thought , in the name of which we reject &quot; wild &quot; ( or all those we choose to consider as such ) outside humanity , is precisely the most striking and inst@@ inc@@ tive attitude of these very sav@@ ages .
&#91; ... &#93; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; Human@@ ity stops at the borders of the tri@@ be , of the linguistic group , sometimes even of the village ; so much so that a large number of so-called pri@@ mi@@ tive populations refer to a name that means &quot; men &quot; ( or sometimes - will we say with more discretion ? ) , &quot; good ones &quot; , &quot; p@@ ies &quot; , &quot; complete &quot; , and so they &apos;@@ re at best composed of &quot; bad &quot; , &apos; bad &apos; , &apos; &apos; b@@ ann@@ ers
We often go so far as to deprive foreigners of this last degree of reality by making a &quot; gh@@ o@@ st &quot; or &quot; appearance &quot; .
So there are curious situations where two interlocu@@ tors give themselves a so@@ ber response .
In the G@@ ran@@ des Anti@@ l@@ les , a few years after the discovery of America , while the Span@@ i@@ ards were sending investig@@ ative committees to find out if the native had a soul , they used to im@@ mer@@ se white wh@@ ites , to check , through prolonged monitoring , if their cor@@ p@@ se was or not subject to the pun@@ ch .
&#91; ... &#93; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; By refusing humanity to those who appear like the most &quot; wild &quot; or &quot; bar@@ b@@ arians &quot; of its representatives , we only have to borrow one of their typical attitudes .
The bar@@ b@@ age is first the man who believes in bar@@ b@@ arity .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; * * When we study such facts - and other areas of civilisation , such as social institutions , art , religion , would easily provide similar ones - we &apos;@@ ll have to ask ourselves if human societies do not define themselves , given their mutual relations , by a certain op@@ timi@@ zation of diversity beyond which they can &apos;t go , but below which they can &apos;t go down without danger either .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; More diversity , and it &apos;s the relationship with other cultures that are compromised .
L@@ ess diversity , and it &apos;s every culture in itself that is in danger .
&#91; ... &#93; Too many differences , and the gap becomes insur@@ moun@@ table ; not enough , and identity dies .
* * &@@ g@@ t@@ ; I protest against the language abuse by which , more and more , we &apos;@@ re just confusing racism with normal , legitimate attitudes , even , in any case , inevitable .
Racism is a doctrine that claims to see in the intellectual and moral character attributed to a group of people the necessary effect of a common genetic heritage .
We can &apos;t con@@ done under the same heading , or automatically to the same prejudice the attitude of individuals or groups that their loyalty to certain values makes partially or totally in@@ sensitive to other values .
He is not guilty of placing a way of living and thinking about it above all the others and having little attr@@ action towards such or such people whose kind of life , respec@@ table in itself , is far away from the one we are traditionally attached to .
This relative in@@ communic@@ ability may even represent the price to pay for the systems of values of each spiritual family or each community to continue , and find in their own funds the resources necessary for their renewal .
If , as I wrote elsewhere , there is a certain diversity of diversity between human societies beyond which they can &apos;t go , but below which they can &apos;t come to a safe end , we must recognize that this diversity results for a large part of the desire of each culture to oppose those who environment , to distinguish themselves from them , in a word of being themselves : they don &apos;t know , go on the occasion , but not per@@ me@@ ate .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The idea is to understand the urgency of an energy revolution and to think about human stup@@ idity ( mel@@ ting gl@@ aci@@ ers , deforestation , the scale of tar s@@ ands , animal car@@ n@@ age , industrial mono@@ culture , olig@@ archy , social class gap , etc . ) TO@@ U@@ T has increased for 10 years .
Whether it &apos;s con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion on ridiculous subjects like &apos; k@@ ick to illustrate a concept &apos; , the use of the word &apos; f@@ uc@@ king &apos; &apos; in a title , of the fusion English , the obvious desire for self-@@ promotion .

D@@ ur to define .
You have people who are very warm at first , but you &apos;@@ ll never have any connection other than the surface with them .
While you are less warm at the beginning but it ends up making friends for life .
I think the Qu@@ e@@ bec@@ kers are more in the 2@@ n@@ d category , while the R@@ O@@ C is more of the first say according to my experiences .
It depends or you will also go .

Yes it &apos;s so much the biggest problem for France the unemployed .
Not the funds managed in ro@@ tten projects , not the jobs that serve nothing , not the lack of means of health and justice , and I &apos;@@ m doing it .
Clearly a few unemployed who abuse it is a bigger problem , I &apos;@@ m sure that it &apos;s these people who make billions lose each year .
Why do you not assume your un@@ tolerant words where there &apos;s no tolerance ?
It &apos;s a shame .

It &apos;s your most absolute right \ &#91; Ed@@ it : and since the poverty threshold is a relative measure , we can continue this methodo@@ logical debate for a long time : - ) \ \ n
I just hope that this way of thinking about inequalities will be less and less widespread .
The context plays a lot but let &apos;s try !
1 - 3 : Yes .
For the 3 , the context is still crucial .
4 : A debate / proof from a judicial point of view , in function I imagine the influence of X on Y@@ . But well , if it &apos;s not a murde@@ rer , it &apos;s col@@ lu@@ sion of murder / acc@@ ess@@ ory to me@@ ter / ye@@ ah down down mu@@ th@@ f@@ uc@@ k@@ a for me .
5 : There &apos;s no 5 sh@@ it , I &apos;@@ m disappointed .
6 : grey area , I imagine that by studying the level of awareness of the risks ( like is it X un@@ consci@@ ously or we heard it say &quot; it &apos;s going to die again and I don &apos;t care &quot; ) , we can consider the murder .
7 - 9 : no , but it &apos;s a high level 2 .
10 : no , it &apos;s fu@@ n but the relationship of cause is too difficult to establish .
11 : It &apos;s much too uncertain .
It is absolutely impossible to guarantee that an action will not lead to the death of anyone , just as the opposite is the pas@@ pe@@ on effect .
So you &apos;@@ ll always arrive at scenarios where you can argue that despite the potential for the death of some people , other more cred@@ itable actions on paper would in the end come up with the same risk .
My answer specifically targeted the C@@ re@@ said In@@ v@@ estig@@ ation Research , not all aid to the private sector .
Having said that , I am a little disappointed with the down@@ votes received on my comment ( I do not target you specifically ) , while I was only giving an opinion in a respectful way .
If you pass your product of X + 3 to X + 2@@ 36 , or your product is already expensive and the price increase to compensate for the tax won &apos;t be felt by consumers or it will be too important for consumers to continue to offer them and look back to an alternative .
If you want to lower demand to increase &quot; only &quot; by 1@@ ,@@ 5 ° C , does it not be better to make sure that the practices that jeopardise this objective are no longer possible ?
Do you want to continue to make profit until it is possible at all ?

It was also a promise of the P@@ Q .
But for Le@@ g@@ ult it &apos;s a more important promise because its thesis is that we can go and look for all the powers we need in Ot@@ ta@@ wa without independence .
So either Ot@@ ta@@ wa ce@@ ases .

Many S@@ hu@@ bs and Z@@ u@@ ul@@ s knew they were going to be in the dep@@ ths of the Sh@@ lo@@ ar on that day , I can tell you .
It was not a vote of MEPs ?

In short , the current price of batter@@ y replacement is not important . If really it &apos;s 40@@ k again in 10 years when you need to change you can just sell the test and buy another car at this price in the 10@@ th year the elec@@ tr@@ ics c@@ ats will cost $ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 , I &apos;@@ m p@@ acked on what is the best solution for now .

There is no leader yet .
Mad@@ uro is an elected president .

How can you refu@@ te the result of the May 201@@ 8 election that saw Mad@@ uro re-@@ elected , but accept that of the legislative , yet organize by the same government ?
There is a logic problem here .

o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ i@@ a@@ a@@ ay .
Gi@@ ve me a lot of stereotypes that we find in this comment .
I &apos;@@ m pol@@ ite , so I &apos;@@ m not la@@ ugh@@ ing at anyone in recent days when the world ( more specifically the media ) has broken the &quot; storm of the century &quot; .
C@@ ome on !
First of all , I already saw worse several times in the year I spent in Bas@@ -@@ Sain@@ t-@@ Sain@@ t L@@ au@@ rent .
From a person &apos;s point of view , I could easily lau@@ gh about Qu@@ e@@ bec@@ o@@ is ( who could also lau@@ gh about Mon@@ tre@@ al@@ is , because I spent a winter in Mon@@ tre@@ al too and it was nothing compared to the winter in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ) .
Secondly , as Al@@ ber@@ t@@ ain , I could lau@@ gh from Qu@@ e@@ bec@@ o@@ is that canc@@ eled all the plans , sports games , etc .
I di@@ dn &apos;t lau@@ gh , because I understand that it &apos;s prudent not to take risks when we are not used to it .
But this storm has been like every other storm in the pra@@ ises every year .
You live with , and me , I conducted the same conditions in the city , on the high@@ way , in the mountains ( the worst ) almost always without winter ty@@ res and still in a small car ( tr@@ action before ) and without any incidents .
It &apos;s pretty easy , drive not like a i@@ di@@ ot and knowing the condition is the road by testing the bra@@ kes often and when nobody is close .
Third , I lived in Ed@@ mon@@ ton several years ago .
It &apos;s bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it your comment .
I admit that the city of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c is better than E@@ d@@ mon@@ ton ( Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c also gets like 3@@ x the s@@ now ) , but E@@ d@@ mon@@ ton is good in de@@ s@@ now in a cr@@ ush .
The world is only broken because the small residential streets ( whose city has caused too much of the urban floor ) are not treated first .
But the city quickly released the roads for buses and other main roads .
They manage s@@ now effectively at Ed@@ mon@@ ton .
And finally your comment from the British Col@@ um@@ bian has many mistakes .
You &apos;@@ re talking about L@@ ow@@ er Main@@ land ( ie me@@ tr@@ o V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver ) and forget that the other one million km / <unk> 2 get a lot of s@@ now , especially in the mountains .
The British people outside V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver are quite used .
Better than several in the city .
Also , how many &quot; Chinese &quot; know you from the west ?
I don &apos;t know the situation in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver too much , but Al@@ ber@@ ta has a lot of people of Chinese origin including second-@@ generation cab@@ p who are as competent as others because they were born in Al@@ ber@@ ta .
Life is not impossible , if that &apos;s what you want to hear .
But please recommend being in the opposition , that &apos;s all .
Im@@ ag@@ ine that the government in France has to make your allowances dependent or your access to a particular good ( like g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine ) to an identity card that would contain a whole lot of information on you as your political orientation , your income , your religion , etc .
Even if it doesn &apos;t affect the amount of the unemployed , the government explo@@ its your data as Google would do .
What would you think if Mac@@ ron announced that tomorrow ?
mainstream newspapers are biased against Mad@@ uro , that &apos;s normal and that is what the majority in the West expect of them .
On the other hand you will have to tell me the false articles of the Mon@@ de because it &apos;s not very complicated to s@@ lander Mad@@ uro , its policy is open to criticism and it often gets it to tell some nice bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
Mad@@ uro is@@ n &apos;t Cha@@ in .
It will never lead to the UN to critici@@ ze the P@@ O@@ T@@ US with a Ch@@ om@@ sky book in hand .
And then the situation in Venezuela goes a little further than &quot; oil = interference in the United States &quot; .
It &apos;s not entirely false , but it &apos;s simplistic and it won &apos;t convince many people .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; But what about the extreme left and communism ( past and current , c@@ f Venezuela ) ?
1 / The &quot; communism &quot; has only been applied in poor countries , whose regimes were unstable , in a violent way , it &apos;s to say in situations where * all * the regimes fail .
The minimum to judge communism ( if the countries that claimed themselves were it , but I don &apos;t have the impression that democracy and collective property by the workers were the model applied , but let &apos;s move ) would at least be seen to be tested by a fav@@ orable minimum .
On the other hand , the extreme right , we saw what it does in all the imagin@@ able contexts , and it &apos;s always horror .
That said ...
2 / ... I &apos;@@ m not communist , so good .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; To go far the Naz@@ is were generally left
It &apos;s completely wrong .
There was no social progress , union ( it &apos;s even the opposite ) , or eg@@ al@@ itarian under Naz@@ ism , and it &apos;s not because they added on the end &quot; socialist &quot; in their name that they conducted social policies ( Mar@@ x@@ ists were also their first victims in addition to Jews ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; But it seemed worthy of me because you repeated only twice and not extreme L@@ ES .
I don &apos;t see the point of talking about the extreme left in France because it represents less than 1 % of voters , and the representation of her ideas , in addition to being at the lowest , is in sharp decline from the world .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; I can only ask myself what companies would do if the Naz@@ is came to power nowadays .

No it &apos;s very simple to put in place , but it &apos;s not incredible either .
It blocks not everything , it &apos;s not really at the level of a U@@ B@@ O , and it only works in a local network .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Before investing in a project , we make budget capital .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We calculate the Val@@ or A@@ N@@ T N@@ et@@ te ( V@@ N ) , in English we call it N@@ et Pres@@ ent V@@ alum@@ e ( N@@ P@@ V ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We dis@@ count future cash flow generated by investment based on a rate linked to inflation , market and risk .
To put it bl@@ un@@ tly , can I find a hy@@ per profitable thing that pays more to shareholders than would bring them anything else ?
If the project is profitable , it laun@@ ches .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You have 100 euros .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We propose two fields of giant oil .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; In the first project you invest 100 euros .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 0 euros in the first year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 0 euros in the second year .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; In the second project you invest 100 euros .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 60 euros in the first year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 50 euros in the second year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 5 euros in the third year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; What a project you choose ?
It depends on your R@@ R@@ R .
The Re@@ qui@@ id R@@ ate of Rap@@ ur@@ n .
The return rate on investment you demand .
We also sometimes call it Op@@ en ni@@ ghts Co@@ st of Cap@@ it@@ tal .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The project is therefore in competition with other projects that need th@@ hu@@ nes .
The R@@ R@@ R depends on 3 things :
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; inflation : Every year , money loses
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The risk : If you propose a 5 % return rate to invest in T@@ es@@ la , you will say no .
It &apos;s a bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; What the market offers : your fri@@ dge could put it on the stock market or bank .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; To return to our oil projects .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The first project is negative .
You lose money .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The second project is the most profitable .
Looking at it , it was not the case .
Why is it more profitable ?
Because with the second project the fri@@ e is recovered the first year and the second year .
He is more rec@@ laim@@ ed earlier in your poc@@ ket .
What does that mean ?
That you can put it immediately on stock exchange or other projects .
And that you will hit $ $ even earlier .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; Reg@@ ar@@ dless of the project you &apos;@@ re launching , you don &apos;t have health , social , environmental consequences .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You don &apos;t care how many people will kill or hur@@ ry seriously .
We &apos;@@ re doing it , but completely .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The only thing that matters is to do the N@@ P@@ V .
Indeed to calculate the N@@ P@@ V you need a R@@ R@@ R rate .
R@@ R@@ R like R@@ ate of In@@ f@@ lation , R@@ is@@ k , and Mar@@ k@@ et R@@ ate of Rap@@ ur@@ n .
This rate therefore includes the risk of losing money .
The risk that you &apos;@@ re f@@ uc@@ king you into jail , that we discover that you violate the law , that we prohibit your activity , that the whole population is revol@@ ting .
The R@@ R@@ R includes everything .

If it &apos;s positive , we do it .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We don &apos;t care if it &apos;s destructive for the biodiversity of seeds , if it k@@ ills the consumer , if it finances the illegal activities of L@@ af@@ on@@ t or if it acceler@@ ates climate change .

8 to get involved often on the 20 and the 55 , would say it &apos;s especially that the world is driving too fool@@ har@@ dy .
Or I &apos;@@ ve got what it &apos;s two years at Christmas .
I was coming back from the family to go back to us on the 20 , and there was so much ver@@ g@@ as in my glass and my wi@@ ves were obviously a f@@ uc@@ king of ice ice , and I was apparently going to go beyond tr@@ uc@@ ks / auto@@ s to 10@@ 0-@@ 110 who found themselves in the gap not long after I was back out .
Well , I &apos;@@ m fed up with mad@@ rid remove the ice so much it was quickly frozen , I failed to work by leaving the au@@ go .
In my opinion , the y@@ el@@ low bel@@ ts wanted to block the biggest commercial center in the corner on the first Saturday ( a L@@ ec@@ ler@@ c with almost just derived from L@@ ec@@ ler@@ c in the mer@@ ch@@ ant gallery , so very few colle@@ ge@@ au@@ x@@ au@@ x de@@ ga@@ ts at the market .
Then it &apos;s turned into a r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of r@@ d points without ever coming closer to this commercial center .
At least they don &apos;t come to buy the few retailers in the center city , they at least understood who was not the enemy .
I had this feeling because when you go out of school it was a bit that and with time you change and you want something else .
When I started working on the other hand , it was not really the majority of the prof@@ iles I was confronted with .
It &apos;s the c@@ lic@@ h@@ é and surely also the visible part but I spent a good time with my colleagues when I was working in S@@ S@@ II to do various and varied activities , even with dum@@ p@@ -@@ over@@ s .

Personally , I did a V@@ I@@ E , it &apos;s a good experience , in other words than a S@@ S@@ II for me and a bit of de-@@ paying , etc .
It was a good comb@@ o to discover other things !

And what passage is racist ?
The speed rate ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Good .
I know we &apos;@@ re not on the a@@ ha , but the path of over@@ sho@@ oting is reserved to go beyond the maximum speed rate .
If you go beyond anyone else , you don &apos;t have any business at all .
Yes , speed must be mod@@ ul@@ ated according to road conditions but it &apos;s not just for the way out .
An@@ aly@@ way when you go beyond you always go or almost faster than the limit .
It has the police and every driver to decide his security speed certainly not at a mat@@ tress or my un@@ c@@ le that blocks the left path to decide for others .
They can put someone outside for the reason they want , as long as it &apos;s not illegal .

Do you want this arbitrary representation so much ?
I say quite arbitrary , because in your assembly , you &apos;@@ re not going to put children of 2 years or mentally ill , if ?
Y@@ e@@ ah too much bu@@ g under Sa@@ af@@ i ( and this comment and yet posted since Sa@@ f@@ i ) , it may be the fault of web develop@@ ers and not of the b@@ row@@ ser but I regularly have sites that bu@@ g under Sa@@ af@@ i and when I pass under Ch@@ ro@@ e no problem .
I still use Sa@@ af@@ i as the main b@@ row@@ ser ( if only for his integration with mac@@ O@@ S and the func@@ tionality of H@@ and@@ off mac@@ O@@ S / i@@ O@@ S , Au@@ to@@ fil@@ l SM@@ S , etc . ) but I &apos;@@ m opening Ch@@ ro@@ e as soon as I have to use a slightly cumbersome or so@@ ber web application .
The problem is that develop@@ ers develop under Ch@@ ro@@ e ( because you have to admit it to deal with it and other tools are great ) , te@@ te@@ sters test under Ch@@ ro@@ e ( because it has 2 / 3 of part of the market ) so it becomes the default b@@ row@@ ser that imposes the norm .

I don &apos;t understand the story of this discred@@ ited resear@@ cher .
Know@@ ing the scientific method , I know very well that it &apos;s possible to prove that the gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ sphere is not dangerous if you om@@ it things .
I don &apos;t understand those who defend the non-@@ ban of gl@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate , those who defend those who are for the gl@@ yp@@ ho@@ o@@ ste hon@@ or .

I brought my daughter to the cr@@ è@@ che this morning .
L@@ it@@ tle came back to the room where she is kept , a small approach is approaching and pushing it viol@@ ently ( they have every two and a half years in general ) and she falls well 1 me@@ ter further , the head not far from a wo@@ o@@ den structure .
There were three staff of the cr@@ è@@ che in this room , including the director , all for less than 10 children .
Not a single one re@@ acts .
So , as it was the third time that this bo@@ y was pushing my gir@@ l in front of me ( two other times another day , without a big reaction either ) , it was heated and I started to k@@ ick the little , under the indifference of the staff .
My gir@@ l during that time was ter@@ r@@ ori@@ zed and did not stop cr@@ ying ( a child of her age , it &apos;s easy , but it was really violent as a push for the age of the little bo@@ y ) .
On the other hand , I said to the director that if it started again , I wanted to talk about it parents of the little bo@@ y , normal .
She replied &quot; o@@ h , but you know , we already know , it does not do like that with your gir@@ l , he &apos;s followed by the p@@ s@@ y , his parents know him &quot; ...
I replied in essence that I agree , but I would still like to talk to parents if it happened and she got out of a pretty aggressive tone : &quot; ok but outside the cr@@ è@@ che &quot; as if I was going to work with them .
I don &apos;t care about it for the day .
already because it &apos;s me who is in the van@@ guard while women stay@@ ed pas@@ sively , and also because if it &apos;s not the first time , it &apos;s not the first time that the bo@@ y has been pushing M@@ A daughter , even surely the case .
It could be good to keep us informed .
And if my gir@@ l falls on a to@@ y or on the side of a table ?
Will it be the time to talk about it when it will be paraly@@ sed or worse ?
