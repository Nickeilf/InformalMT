S@@ pec@@ tr@@ os j@@ um@@ ped into Bo@@ go@@ ta above Bo@@ go@@ ta
The sports sport@@ sman J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lor@@ z j@@ um@@ ped on on Thursday of a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter above Bo@@ go@@ ta , the capital city of Colombia .
E@@ qui@@ pped by a w@@ ound ( a combination of w@@ ings ) , it rose to 160 km / h above the famous Mon@@ ser@@ r@@ at sanc@@ tu@@ ary , located at more than 3 000 metres of al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ ings gathered to observe its fe@@ at .
A black box in your car ?
While road pl@@ ann@@ ers in the United States find it difficult to find the money to repair the motor@@ way infrastructure that is dec@@ re@@ ed , many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the car scoreboard .
The appli@@ ances , which all record a motor@@ ist car and pass on information to officials , are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to re@@ design the obsolete system of financing the main American roads .
The sector , which is generally without planning interest , has suddenly caused a very lively debate and turbul@@ ent alliances .
The liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use small bo@@ xes to keep track of the miles you are talking about , and perhaps the road you are circul@@ ating , and then use the information to draft a draft tax law .
The Te@@ a Party is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And , while members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
They are looking for how , over the next decade , they will be able to move to a system enabling drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of drivers have already embarked on these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with a G@@ PS surveillance system , for an experimental defec@@ t .
This is absolutely essential for our nation .
“ It is not as if we had a choice , ” H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ h@@ ra@@ ta , the chief executive of the Southern California Association Association , said that the state is beginning to record the miles of each Califor@@ n@@ ian motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 . .
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the country ’ s Hi@@ gh@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund , financed with the taxes that Americans pay for the p@@ ump , is financially dry .
Americans no longer buy as much petrol as they did before .
C@@ ars can travel more than ever with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are reluctant to increase the tax even by 1 % , while petrol prices are high .
&apos;@@ The g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not tenable &apos; , said Le@@ e M@@ un@@ n@@ ich , a transport policy expert at Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a University .
His state recently inst@@ alled trac@@ es of 500 cars to test a mine payment system .
“ This appears to be the most logical alternative in the long term , ” he said .
W@@ on@@ ks calls this charges for mil@@ e@@ age .
It is not surprising that the idea of the Liberals is that , since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California ’ s pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state ’ s ambitious state laws on global warming .
But representative Bill Sh@@ ster ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a ) , Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives , said that he also considered him to be the most viable alternative in the long run .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates of the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation ’ s free market also appreciate the idea of making mine drivers pay .
&apos;@@ It is not just a tax that is eng@@ ul@@ fed in a large black hole &apos; , said A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , Vice-President of the policy to the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation .
People pay more for the benefits they receive .
The movement is also supported by two former American secre@@ tar@@ ies in Trans@@ ports who , in a 2011 report , urged Congress to go down the road to mine payment .
The US Senate approved a pilot project of $ 90 a year that would have brought about 10 000 cars .
But the House ’ s presidency has killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural legislators , who have to travel many miles to work or cities every day .
There are , however , some states and large cities that make progress on their side .
The most determined is the O@@ reg@@ on , which has mobili@@ zed 5 000 drivers to carry out the country ’ s most important experience .
These motor@@ ists will soon pay the State for mil@@ e@@ age charges instead of petrol taxes .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City envisages one .
Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is trying to test a limited number of lorries .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in the US east coast ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) , is examining how it could implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where around 50 voluntary motor@@ ists recently f@@ itted their cars with an aircraft , drivers were worried that the government could follow suit .
“ The concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and such things are a big problem , ” Al@@ au@@ d@@ din K@@ han said , leading the strategic management of performance in the N@@ ev@@ ada Department of Trans@@ portation .
That is not something people want .
From the start of the trial , the N@@ ev@@ ada of N@@ ev@@ ada warned its site : “ It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into fully-@@ fledged loc@@ alization devices . ”
There is no need to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure which will inevitably be broad@@ ened to keep people &apos;s daily ta@@ ps and ta@@ ps recorded .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car is running , but without knowing where or what is happening .
If you can do that , then he added K@@ han , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-@@ up of California for the name of T@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society did not go to help motor@@ ists who pay taxes to the Member States .
It sought to pene@@ tr@@ ate the car insurance market , where drivers would pay according to their mil@@ e@@ age .
But the appli@@ ances that it tests have pl@@ agu@@ ed the pl@@ ann@@ ers of major a@@ xes because they do not use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , down@@ loaded perio@@ dic@@ ally by Mo@@ de@@ m .
&apos;@@ People will be more inclined to do this if you do not record speed and do not loc@@ ate them &apos; , said R@@ y@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , Director-General of T@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of certain states .
There are far less expensive ways and far less intru@@ sive methods .
In O@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers try experience by offering motor@@ ists different choices .
They can choose an aircraft with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have any aircraft at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay for a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing appli@@ ances to do more , rather than not enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials seek to develop a tax mechanism that would also be equipped to pay for par@@ king costs , provide “ driving for driving ” insurance and create a set of real-@@ time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid j@@ um@@ ps . It is ill@@ us@@ ory .
“ motor@@ ists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits of the system , ” indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder whether the whole debate on mine payment is simply a huge di@@ version .
To the Commission ’ s Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an Trans@@ portation Area of San Franc@@ is@@ co , officials say that Congress could quite simply deal with the Hi@@ gh@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund by raising taxes on petrol .
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol , so that everyone pays their fair share .
“ There is no need to resort to radical sur@@ ger@@ y when you simply need aspir@@ in , ” the head of legislation and public affairs with the committee said .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motor@@ ists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bo@@ ie : four me@@ ats in e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an did not come to surprise this year .
From The N@@ ex@@ t Day , published in January , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a luxury edi@@ tion scheduled for November 4 , with several me@@ ats .
Four have already emerged on the web .
The announcement of the publication of a new al@@ bu@@ m of David Bow@@ ie left the whole world out .
On the day of his 6@@ 6@@ th birth@@ day on 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ bu@@ m would emerge in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last dis@@ count , Re@@ ali@@ ty , the date of 2003 ) and too few public appearances in public , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an demonstrated that we could still rely on him to s@@ cra@@ p the po@@ p stage .
A f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans
Not tired of sur@@ prises , David Bow@@ ie had more of a r@@ ank in his ba@@ g with The N@@ ex@@ t Day .
The Th@@ in White Du@@ ke plan to re@@ construct this al@@ bu@@ m on 4 November .
On the occasion he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a real f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans .
This edi@@ tion , entitled The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a , will arise in the form of three records : the original al@@ bu@@ m , unprecedented session sessions , and rem@@ n@@ ants , as well as a D@@ V@@ D containing the four c@@ lic@@ ks that have already been un@@ ve@@ iled .
The N@@ ex@@ t Day Ex@@ tr@@ a will contain a further ten ti@@ t@@ les compared with the original al@@ bu@@ e : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x@@ is , five special s@@ ong@@ s un@@ ve@@ iled for the opportunity , as well as two rem@@ n@@ ants .
In fact , David Bow@@ ie made the presen@@ tations of this fine co@@ ff@@ t in a video .
It introduces both records , but also the acc@@ ess@@ ories with : exclusive exclusive photo@@ graph@@ s and photo@@ graph@@ s , a net to share their own im@@ pres@@ sions , a boo@@ k@@ keeping with words ...
And , above all , he gives a fore@@ taste of his new title , At@@ om@@ ica , typically in The N@@ ex@@ t Day ’ s ve@@ in , with the gu@@ ts ahead and ro@@ ck ro@@ ck electricity that has been sk@@ il@@ fully controlled .
H@@ und@@ reds of E@@ ven@@ ts
But At@@ om@@ ica is not the only title un@@ ve@@ iled .
The In@@ forming , Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ck@@ et M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , is also available on the web .
The In@@ forming is in double face : an omin@@ ous in@@ sid@@ er before a c@@ av@@ al@@ c@@ an ca@@ val@@ c@@ ade that is gradually slowing down and leaving room for a po@@ p .
O@@ ut of Li@@ ke A M@@ an M@@ an , did we want to make a small reference to the Ro@@ ck@@ let M@@ an , M@@ an John M@@ an , or even to Gr@@ avi@@ ty ?
With this title , the sing@@ er appears at least to be in his own part when he no longer has his feet on the ground .
S@@ pace O@@ d@@ di@@ ty , on the other hand , was much more serious .
With B@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , David Bow@@ ie once again makes reference to his str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold : will he come from another planet ?
The ne@@ ar@@ by ri@@ ff@@ ers , the en@@ vo@@ ys of the earth , want to leave the earth .
In any case , we know that we are playing with these ti@@ t@@ les with these ti@@ t@@ les : an inform@@ er , a man on board a roc@@ ket , a Mar@@ tian potential ...
It conce@@ als and reveals at the same time to adopt various person@@ alities , as he has done throughout his career , particularly with his charac@@ ters Z@@ i@@ gg@@ y St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ addi@@ n S@@ ane .
It is not surprising , therefore , that he has a ma@@ m@@ mo@@ th in the photo@@ grap@@ h of the campaign La In@@ vi@@ tation in the Vo@@ y@@ age of Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , whose new face he embo@@ dies .
He will appear in one of their advertising s@@ spo@@ ts , broadcast from 10 November .
The Defence Minister , Ro@@ b Nichol@@ son , insisted that the injured soldiers were not sum@@ mon@@ ed by the Canadian Ar@@ med For@@ ces , and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life .
At@@ t@@ ached by Liberals and Democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Nichol@@ son assured Nichol@@ son that before they were released , the members of the army would follow a transitional plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
All the injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life , and none of them have been released before they are ready , he said .
Cri@@ tics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not comply with the rule of the army &apos;s &apos; univers@@ ality of service &apos; requiring staff to be able to carry out a number of different tasks - to reach the 10 years of ad@@ mis@@ sibility required for services . reti@@ re .
In particular , they cited two cases reported by the Pres@@ se Canad@@ ians , including the one of a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Corpor@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a London reser@@ vis@@ t , On@@ tariff , reached post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , has been released from the army despite its request to remain another year in order to receive a fully inde@@ xed pension .
His case after that of Corpor@@ al G@@ l@@ en Kir@@ ge , who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of univers@@ ality of service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared with plans and consultation meetings , but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;@@ I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said in an interview with La Pres@@ se Canad@@ ians on Wednesday .
For months , I asked whether there was a way for me to stay , and they said no .
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has found it difficult to determine what la@@ titude it can give to the injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks , but who are not capable of fighting .
Under the current rules , the seriously injured soldiers have been injured up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deploy@@ ments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that among the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons 19@@ 9 had not reached the service period required for pension provision .
The liberal spokes@@ person for former combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked on Wednesday for the reintegration of Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , while the neo-@@ democr@@ at J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for an immediate end to &quot; this shameful practice . &quot;
Dis@@ ney T@@ rou@@ b@@ als to launch a series of anim@@ ated series of t@@ ab@@ lets
The American media and enter@@ tainment group decided to put t@@ ab@@ lets on its own television channels for the next round of children to emerge from a new set of children .
The first nine episo@@ des of S@@ her@@ i@@ ff Cred@@ it Wil@@ d West will be available from 24 November on the B@@ at@@ ch@@ ris@@ y@@ y@@ j@@ uni@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m site or through its use for tele@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
Its global launch on the Dis@@ ney Group ’ s channels is foreseen only in 2014 , details of its Dis@@ ney J@@ uni@@ or division ’ s communi@@ qu@@ é .
The anim@@ ated design for children between 2@@ 2-@@ 7 years of age tells the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the Ch@@ at@@ te C@@ alli@@ e , a sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of a town in the West American , where it puts order with a magic l@@ o .
Each episo@@ de includes two histor@@ ies of 11 minutes .
&apos;@@ Inter@@ -@@ act with smar@@ t@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commented on Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , Vice-President of Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , mentioned in the communi@@ qu@@ é .
This type of experience is part of Dis@@ ney ’ s efforts to “ extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its public thanks to more and more important digital platforms , ” added .
A survey published earlier this week by the Commission showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of less 2 years of age have already served a t@@ ab@@ let or a telephone , and 72 % less than 8 years old , compared to 10 % and 38 % respectively . Two years ago .
S@@ now@@ den is prepared to “ cooperate ” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance .
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lowing , said that he was prepared to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director K@@ e@@ ith Alexander were not providing answers on their activities .
The German MEP Hans@@ -@@ Christian Stra@@ ö@@ be@@ l on Thursday met Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia , where he has the right to asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter which the honourable Member presented to the media in Berlin Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a le@@ ak and seeks to penalise political dis@@ course with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself &apos; .
However , to tell the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he believed that international support could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him .
In the case of the complaint lod@@ ged by the US Department of Justice , he is accused of es@@ pion@@ age and the@@ ft of state assets .
“ If Mr S@@ now@@ den is prepared to talk to German officials , Mr S@@ now@@ den is prepared to make that possible . ”
Relations between the United States and Germany were tested following complaints that the N@@ SA had been listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .
Thomas O@@ p@@ hot@@ n , the Member who heads the parliamentary group super@@ vising the foreign secret services , indicated that if there was a chance to hear Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness &apos; without endang@@ ering and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States &apos; , it was necessary to take advantage of this .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a German MEP , has published a photo@@ grap@@ h of him with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
During his visit to Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr Stra@@ ö@@ be@@ l said that , according to the lawyer of the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Mr S@@ now@@ den could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den were to testi@@ fy in Germany , he would have to be assured that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , he said .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of &apos; serious and sustained persecution &apos; which forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global response to ‘ my act of political expression ’ .
Citizens around the world and senior officials – including the United States – thought that re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was public uti@@ lity .
The letter puts forward a offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Co@@ g@@ o C@@ able could soon offer inter@@ active television .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s subscri@@ bers could well have access to applications like Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter , and the ultimate video service on demand Net@@ f@@ li@@ x via television in a future that does not seem so far away .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary indicated Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests in the B@@ et@@ ta version of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;@@ This will enable us to enhance us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces as well as more options &apos; , explained the President and head of the management of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , Lou@@ is Au@@ d@@ et , in a meeting .
Co@@ g@@ o C@@ â@@ te is similar to his competitors , such as Bel@@ l , even though Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s subsidiary has no precise date for this new platform .
&apos;@@ We must adapt and change or resist change &apos; , Mr Aud@@ et pointed out .
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers currently do not have access .
The T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations giant Ro@@ gers has already indicated that it could offer Net@@ f@@ li@@ x if some technical details , which were not mentioned , could be settled .
In the United States , the popular video service says that it is in discussions with some major distributors so that its service is available via their distribution platforms .
The CE@@ EC@@ -@@ Co@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ o C@@ age also welcomed the Har@@ per government ’ s announcement in its Tro@@ j@@ ne speech on October 16 .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force c@@ able and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the services .
&apos;@@ It is about two and a half years &apos; that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of channels , it does not work , said Mr Aud@@ et .
It hopes , however , that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Council on T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations and T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations ( R@@ T@@ T@@ C ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;@@ It will have to emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework to define our new television policy in Canada on television &apos; , and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o said it .
The R@@ T@@ C has held consultations with the public since last week and they should continue next spring with industry next week .
On the results side , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o indicated that it had recorded a net benefit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 out of action .
This is a retro@@ grade step compared to the net benefit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million or 83 per capita for the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this decline by means of depreci@@ ation costs linked to new acquis@@ i@@ tions .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o acquired in 2012 the Atlantic Bro@@ ad@@ band c@@ able , established in the United States , for EUR 1.@@ 36 billion .
This was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal .
Last December , a company company in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver also bought P@@ er 1 Network ( V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver ) for the sum of EUR 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s income , they grew by 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter to 5@@ 4.@@ 7 million .
They are EUR 1.@@ 8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ â@@ ble , was 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 per capita , in decline compared with the 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million , or 93 per capita , of the same period last year .
Co@@ g@@ o C@@ able income has , however , increased by 45 % to 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 customers in the fourth quarter .
However , for the 2013 financial year , the number of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able customers is increasing 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Aud@@ et is not concerned about the number of customers fluctu@@ ating in this way .
For me , this is not an indication of a change of trend , he has observed .
It varies from one quarter to another with very high competition .
Be@@ ef in Be@@ ef products
H@@ horse meat has been found in can@@ ned bo@@ vine bo@@ xes , sold by two small British school@@ teachers with low-cost distribution , announced today the food hygiene agency .
routine tests revealed that the products , drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the H@@ om@@ eland Ho@@ st and Qu@@ ali@@ ty Sa@@ ve chains , contained the DNA DNA of 1 to 5 % .
&apos;@@ Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the British agency .
A scandal concerning the presence of horse meat in co@@ o@@ ked food broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following the tests carried out in Ireland .
According to exam@@ inations by the European Commission , France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products which are supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles was w@@ ounded , early on Friday , on the 1@@ 31 road in Lan@@ audi@@ ère .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ th , a motor@@ ist who was moving in the north , in St F@@ eli@@ x@@ -@@ Val@@ o@@ is , lost his ma@@ ster@@ y and lost a car that came in the other direction .
The four occup@@ i@@ ers of the two vehicles were injured , but there was no fear of their lives .
The movement was back to normal at 6@@ th Friday , Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make lu@@ gg@@ age pay for hand lu@@ gg@@ age
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make up to $ 100 for passengers carrying hand lu@@ gg@@ age on flights .
B@@ ans Air@@ lines envisages starting to make up to $ 100 for a hand b@@ agg@@ age and $ 2 for a coffee or a so@@ da coffee , though in his announcement on Wednesday , she said that passengers could take the un@@ open can@@ te with them to the plane des@@ cent .
New hand@@ bag@@ s of lu@@ gg@@ age concern the bag@@ s in the higher compar@@ tment , so the small bag@@ s inst@@ alled under the seat will always be free .
B@@ ans said that she would pay $ 25 if the costs were paid in advance and $ 100 if travellers paid only once at the door of bo@@ arding .
The Fron@@ tier spokesman , K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , said that $ 100 was planned to indu@@ ce travellers to pay the costs in advance .
“ We do not want to make that price , ” she explained .
The airlines have begun to make the first and second lu@@ gg@@ age registered in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who tried to avoid these costs made as many things as they could in hand lu@@ gg@@ age in higher compar@@ tments , so there was often no room in these compar@@ tments .
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers transport fewer things on board .
O@@ d Mal@@ ley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a question of making the most faithful clients understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in superior compar@@ tments .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger qu@@ eu@@ ing at an bo@@ arding pass Fron@@ tier may transport a ba@@ g free of charge , while the next person in the qu@@ e@@ ue may have to pay $ 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
O@@ d Mal@@ ley explained that the site and the Fron@@ tier registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before arriving at the door .
Fron@@ tier lu@@ gg@@ age fees will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often run rou@@ gh@@ sh@@ od over b@@ agg@@ age and other costs , but the airlines love them .
They believe that the costs of handling lu@@ gg@@ age are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it .
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of lu@@ gg@@ age charges as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Many of them , however , have not reached the cost of lu@@ gg@@ age .
S@@ pi@@ rit Air@@ lines In@@ c@@ . had applied early lu@@ gg@@ age costs three years ago , and the lo@@ w@@ -@@ co@@ co@@ -@@ Al@@ lean@@ ing company followed a little later .
The only other company that imposes such charges is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , has declared the consul@@ tant to J@@ ay S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , who is closely following the costs .
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that S@@ pi@@ rit ’ s hand@@ -@@ b@@ agg@@ age charges reported $ 50 M per year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former Mid@@ west Air@@ line framework , recently travel@@ ed on S@@ pi@@ rit and won@@ dered what he would find at the bo@@ arding door when passengers would discover the unusual hand of hand lu@@ gg@@ age imposed by the company .
He said he had never seen such a flu@@ id bo@@ arding procedure throughout my professional career .
I was expecting te@@ eth and a g@@ lu@@ t to bur@@ st on the door .
The plane was full , he added , &apos; passengers are on board at the speed of the light &apos; .
Fron@@ tier is also S@@ pi@@ ri@@ t and charges $ 2 for a coffee , a te@@ a , a so@@ da or fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier people have indicated that passengers who take a so@@ da or fruit ju@@ ice can take the can@@ te that is not open with them , and those who take coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
U@@ S Air@@ ways briefly tried to make be@@ ver@@ ages pay in 2008 , but back seven months later after passengers complained and no other large airline followed .
The decision by B@@ ans Fron@@ tier to make hand lu@@ gg@@ age fees when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage clients to go on his website .
Air@@ lines pay for online travel sel@@ lers like Or@@ bi@@ z 10@@ -@@ $ 25 for each ticket sold .
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier has gone further in this area .
In September , it began to offer only half of the fi@@ de@@ lity to customers who buy their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it reduced the premiums for miles by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a frontier travel trip to an online travel agency for an online travel agency will make it possible to win 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seats in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Fron@@ tier site .
Fron@@ tier has a faithful cli@@ en@@ te@@ le in his home town , Den@@ ver , but his activity is declining and she is losing money .
revenue fell by 9 % , and its flight capacity fell by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to financial results published by its parent company , Re@@ public Air@@ ways , Inte@@ l .
Re@@ public has tried to correct Fron@@ tier finances by selling the airline .
The N@@ SA calls into question an &quot; internal error &quot; and not the ha@@ c@@ kers for its site .
On Friday , the shad@@ ow@@ y National Security Agency declared that it was a bun@@ ch that caused the public site to b@@ ite for a few hours , not ha@@ c@@ kers , as some might have said online .
&apos;@@ N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v has remained in@@ accessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a planned update &apos; , indicated the sp@@ ying agency in a statement by em@@ ail .
The problem will be solved this evening .
C@@ laim@@ s that the failure was due to an attack on the denial of a distributed service &#91; D@@ S@@ D &#93; are false .
Ear@@ lier this evening trac@@ es of online ser@@ vers noted that the N@@ SA site had been broken for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokesman told A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was not “ at all ” compromise .
No classified information is in danger , has explained the spokesman .
At least a group of online ha@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts claimed to be responsible for the N@@ SA ’ s failure to attack D@@ S@@ D .
D@@ S@@ D attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
Cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is not very sophisticated , and attacks are not intended to pene@@ tr@@ ate the internal network of the targeted system .
The on@@ ce-@@ co@@ ver@@ t N@@ SA , the time known as “ N@@ o Su@@ ch A@@ gen@@ c@@ y , ” found itself in the spot@@ light and strongly criticized in recent months as a result of a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its extensive national and foreign communications surveillance programs . – who is part of the N@@ SA secret files and lea@@ ked by the N@@ SA ’ s former dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted consul@@ tant , Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
This growing controversy around the agency led to much speculation that this evening ’ s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
The Del@@ ta C@@ centre now closed
The Del@@ ta C@@ centre Ho@@ tel C@@ centre V@@ ill@@ es closed down on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that had the edi@@ fic@@ e sold it to promo@@ ters who will turn it into student homes .
Three hundred and fifty people were working in the ho@@ tel .
Of these , 200 have still not found a new job .
Del@@ ta promises not to let down its employees .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers have come to meet employees directly there , they have been met individually to assess their needs .
&apos;@@ This will continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the work relations of H@@ ed@@ tel Del@@ ta , F@@ é@@ li@@ x B@@ is@@ son .
The closure of the Del@@ ta takes place in a highly competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that own@@ s that buil@@ der had choices to make .
Either he re@@ invested in the building to continue to operate , so there was investment of tens of millions while the competition is very f@@ ero@@ ci@@ ous , there are many new hot@@ els that emerged in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&apos;@@ Or it would sell it to someone else , and that is what happened &apos; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ult , the holder of the U@@ Q@@ A@@ M C@@ ar of Tourism .
Other Mon@@ tre@@ al hot@@ els will also be converted in the next few months , such as the C@@ rown P@@ la@@ za , which will become a residence for older people .
In the meantime , four ho@@ tel projects tot@@ alling around 600 cham@@ bers will see the light of day in two years &apos; time .
For the CE@@ O of Ti@@ tan , “ The Pro@@ ject of Go@@ od@@ ar A@@ mi@@ re@@ an is starting with zero employee employee . ”
Having sh@@ rou@@ ded the bu@@ ck in January for the partial recovery of the North ’ s Go@@ od@@ year site promised to close , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or ’ s chief executive CE@@ O , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , now dec@@ la@@ res that he is ready to save 3@@ 33 out of 1@@ 137 jobs on 1 137 . The factory .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ burg , the Minister for productive recovery , announced that on Monday 21 October .
Having given up on the draft purchase of the plant in January , you are now .
You had made violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about so-called &apos; so-called lab@@ ou@@ rers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; mad &apos; trade unions , with a view to C@@ G@@ T .
We do not understand this U@@ -@@ turn .
Is it to please Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Ex@@ cep@@ t for my wife .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg , is a young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs .
If I have been injured by my words , I am sorry .
France , however , has a high level of tax and unemployment .
Does the truth lie with you ?
France is working seven hours a day when it works eight hours in other countries .
In India , in China and in the full of other countries , we are working 10 to 12 hours per day .
But I have no prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory which produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is located and has space to grow .
Why does Ti@@ tan need this plant so much ?
Ti@@ tan does not need to buy this plant .
But , with the right price and the skilled workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement are you waiting for between G@@ T@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Go@@ od@@ year had offered employees a good start allowance , I think 100 % of employees would have accepted it .
Now , imagine that Ti@@ tan bu@@ ys the closed factory to Go@@ od@@ year .
So Ti@@ tan could move the machines to Poland or any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency .
I think Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg knows that .
But he wants to keep the factory in A@@ mine with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid jobs .
Ti@@ tan agrees to recru@@ it some of the 1 200 current Go@@ od@@ year employees .
So Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a commitment from Ti@@ tan before trying to get the C@@ G@@ T to sit down at the table with Go@@ od@@ year .
The first step is for the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year to reach an agreement on the departure allowances for all employees .
So there will be no employees at the factory .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you were ready to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm that ?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four@@ -year guarantee .
However , as I said , the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year must first agree on starting allowances .
If all employees accept them , the plan to purchase the factory is starting with zero employed .
How can we provide guarantees of working time when there are no employees left at the site ?
If Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg succe@@ eds in ensuring that C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year come to an agreement and that Ti@@ tan bu@@ ys the plant , we intend to remain in A@@ mi@@ en@@ s-@@ North more than four years ago .
B@@ om@@ bo@@ di@@ er ’ s benefit , while deli@@ veries and orders of aircraft are shrin@@ king .
B@@ om@@ lar@@ er In@@ c , Canadian aircraft manufacturer , has reported a 15 % drop in its net profits on Thursday , under pressure from orders and aircraft deli@@ veries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Tro@@ ika division .
B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , has also not provided flying data for her new C@@ Ser@@ ge@@ an aircraft or any information on whether the aeroplan@@ e will comply with its ambitious business agenda before September .
Following the inaug@@ ural flight of the trial aircraft about a month and a half ago , it only stolen three times , and the question then was whether the trial phase was on track .
The results did not match up to forecasts , and the share price fell 8 % on the Tor@@ onto stock market .
Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st in the National Bank Financial , low@@ ered its rating on Thursday , from “ over@@ performance ” to “ sector performance ” because of the stock exchange ’ s low growth potential in the next quarter or two quarters .
&quot; Although the fall in aircraft deli@@ veries has largely been anticipated , we are truly disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Di@@ vision &apos; , declared Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a note to customers .
We believe that B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er will register new orders for his C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft as the flying test programme moves forward .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er hopes that C@@ Ser@@ ge@@ an ’ s family will be able to cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the lower seg@@ ment of a market that is now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and took over for the first time in September after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for C@@ Ser@@ ies ’ aircraft has so far been modest , as it appears that potential bu@@ yers await flight tests to valid@@ ate the company ’ s energy efficiency and potential savings of new air@@ lin@@ ers .
At present , society has recorded a total of 40@@ 3 orders and commitments to purchase from 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ must , President and head of management , is convinced that B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er will reach his goal of 300 firm orders before the first aeroplan@@ e is used .
Lead@@ ers also reassured analy@@ sts and the media on Thursday that the programme was moving in line with the timetable .
&quot; The test plane has not remained on the ground longer than anticipated , &quot; stated Mr Be@@ au@@ must at a telephone conference , adding that ground trials and software up@@ dates were planned during the time when the plane was shut down .
Each manufacturer is planning differently .
We decided to take a first flight and to provide for a period of updating , and that is what we have done .
This will be repeated throughout the flight programme .
The second test of five test planes is expected to fly over the next few weeks , while others will follow shortly afterwards .
Yet analy@@ sts are skep@@ tical that the first customer can fly C@@ Ser@@ ies only 12 months after his inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er has indicated that she is in the process of assessing the timetable for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months .
“ This slow@@ ness in flying – though apparently in line with B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er ’ s internal timetable – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015 ’ , which Mr Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said .
In the third quarter of September 30 September , B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er ’ s net benefit fell to $ 14@@ 7 M , or 8 c@@ ents per Action , compared to $ 17@@ 2 M , or 9 c@@ ents per Action , a year earlier .
The result of adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
In@@ incomes have fallen slightly from $ 4.@@ 2 to $ 4.@@ 1 trillion .
An@@ aly@@ sts expected a result of $ 10 c@@ ents per Action and $ 4.@@ 56 per income , according to Thomas Re@@ u@@ ters Re@@ u@@ ters / E / E / E / S@@ .
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter , compared to 57 a year earlier .
The net orders fell to 26 aeroplan@@ es , compared to 83 before .
The delay in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics division was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 M@@ d until 30 September , unchanged from 31 December of the previous year .
&quot; In A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing &apos; , stated Mr Be@@ au@@ must .
A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics ’ s income fell 13 % to $ 2 M@@ d .
B@@ om@@ lar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , said that the income of this division had increased by roughly 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 trillion .
The comm@@ an@@ ding comm@@ ander of the Transport Di@@ vision total@@ ed $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 until 30 September , a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year .
The margins of the Transport Di@@ vision have suffered from implementing problems relating to a few large contracts .
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided in the fourth quarter .
The course of B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er &apos;s actions , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ch@@ et@@ te , the head of the Google In@@ c Financial Management Board , would sit on the Management Board , fell from 8@@ .5 % to Canadian USD 4.@@ 83 on Thursday afternoon .
Brazil &apos;s company Em@@ bra@@ er SA , third world aircraft manufacturer and B@@ om@@ b@@ ar@@ di@@ er , on Thursday indicated a 10 % reduction in its quar@@ terly profits .
Two 2@@ 3-@@ 27 years were missing from an ab@@ ys@@ s under the De@@ ath De@@ ath since Thursday evening , with the rescue of the Is@@ ère Re@@ li@@ ef S@@ pu@@ t@@ o on Friday .
They were located this Friday afternoon .
The two men , a cra@@ w@@ l in practice and the other not , were on earth on Thursday at 9.@@ 30 p.m. to make a crossing from the De@@ ath of C@@ l@@ ass on the municip@@ ality of St Pi@@ er@@ re de Char@@ tr@@ ous .
At that time , we had no news of them since then , and that was the same source .

Do@@ z@@ ens of people on the ground
Some 20 sec@@ ur@@ ists , ten civilian members of the French rescue council , and police officers , C@@ R@@ S and fire fighters were there .
At the end of this afternoon this Friday , the two sc@@ ales were loc@@ alised .
&apos;@@ He is another group of pe@@ l@@ le@@ olog@@ ists who have found the information to one of the network rescue teams after being exhausted but in good health , &apos; explains Le D@@ au@@ ph@@ all .

Germany ’ s Jour@@ n@@ alists Go@@ ing Go@@ o@@ le and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o
The German journalists &apos; union invited its members on Thursday to stop using Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o online services following new re@@ vel@@ ations about the activities of US and British intelligence services .
&apos;@@ The German Federation of Jour@@ n@@ alists recommends that journalists avoid the use of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o &apos;s search engines and mess@@ aging machines &apos; , she says in a communi@@ qu@@ é .

&quot; The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them , &quot; added Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ k@@ en , the president of the trade union , who claimed 3@@ 8@@ ,000 adhe@@ rents .
These are pain@@ ted : a Member is asking for the resignation of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ tw@@ els .
Mr Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ ch@@ els &apos; plan to read &apos; traffic lights &apos; in Brussels does not suit everyone .
Just to remind you , Mr Brussels of the P@@ u@@ x@@ el@@ lo@@ i P@@ u@@ x@@ ine and Transport Minister on Thursday in the centre of Brussels launched a test project to re@@ pain@@ t 16 po@@ les of traffic lights in the region at the y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ours of Brussels .
The aim is to &apos; increase security &apos; and &apos; Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long run , to re-@@ pain@@ t all the traffic lights in Brussels at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
But the blue card chosen by the Minister is &apos; too bl@@ ank &apos; , according to Mr Brussels of Bo@@ c@@ k , who talks about the &apos; Flem@@ ish &apos; of the capital and calls for the &apos; resignation &apos; of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els .
No content of spending sk@@ il@@ fully spending from Brussels in operations to re@@ connect po@@ les of sign@@ alling po@@ les at the Brussels R@@ region , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els continues with the Capital of Culture , Mr De Bo@@ c@@ k re@@ sto@@ res Mr De Bo@@ c@@ k .

According to the honourable Member , there is no longer any difference in visual continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels &apos; .
Brussels Brussels deserves better than to see their money squ@@ an@@ dered by a C@@ D Minister &amp; V that is itself carrying out the N@@ V@@ A programme .
It is high time that the Tro@@ j@@ an horse of F@@ landers was stopped .

It is already five years since my father er@@ ased from the world of living .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking about him at the moment ,
I was so afraid to forget that , or rather , I did not know how I was going to continue to &apos; attend &apos; .
There is no such thing as a recipe , a form of employment to go through the wall of the in@@ visible and its own .
Then there were signs .
The first time was the very strong sense of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving .
Another time , a d@@ aw@@ n re@@ aw@@ ak@@ ening in the middle of the night to look at his shows who no longer leaves me , asked on the night table .
It is the image of my s@@ mil@@ ing father who ac@@ companies me in my daily gest@@ ures .
Our mother left after her fight against cancer .
That , at least , is what I thought the day I found his body empty , cryst@@ alli@@ zed on this hospital bed with sh@@ red@@ ded flags .
Similarly , his fun@@ eral was an ic@@ e@@ red f@@ are@@ well focused on the meag@@ re g@@ lim@@ mer of the can@@ n@@ ons that fram@@ ed his co@@ ff@@ in .
I thought it was part of it .
L@@ it@@ tle by little , by small f@@ rac@@ tured or no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal events , a little ti@@ mid , somewhat er@@ ased , she quickly returned to my mind , moving along with her place in the landscape of my thinking , which believed himself to have been in m@@ our@@ ning .
And then it turned out to be , at the same time as revealing my own fac@@ ets , which I had not yet seen , m@@ asked by my relationship with it .
I have therefore learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother , but simply a woman whom I did not really know , a woman who embo@@ died that person during his stay in life .
By dying , this woman had perfect her life and released the person I helped , and here I found her , full and full .
This de@@ t@@ achment from my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful .
It is a privilege to know that people never leave us .
I look like my father , &apos; both inside and outside &apos; .
I have always been told .
I never believed it at the time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , sick .
Here , I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love it .
One day he died .
For a long time he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I had bad ...
He was speaking , and constantly encouraging me , to live my body .
I saw his hands with mine , and I was giving him my body .
But that was never inc@@ re@@ mental .
I was able to have a personal life .
He left me in@@ tim@@ ate .
It took a long time and one day he left .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged and advised .
I no longer know who said that people who have died are not forgotten but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer , but I am constantly making them close to me .
Every event , every moment in my life , makes me feel presence here because I always refer to it : what would they have said , what would they have thought , and what would they have ?
I constantly dream of them , perhaps not all ni@@ ghts but several times a week .
I often dream of the last few moments that I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always something that prevents me from doing this moment .
I often wo@@ ke up when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence .
On the contrary , some dreams are , on the contrary , part of my history and , indeed , they continue to live and share my life .
The eve of my emi@@ gration , where I had to know the sex of my baby , dre@@ am@@ t that I wo@@ ke up , I was sitting out of the bed , my father expected me to be on the f@@ ence and he was s@@ mil@@ ing and rejo@@ ic@@ ing that I was waiting for a small bo@@ y .
The next day I had the feeling that he was visiting me in my sle@@ ep and told me that he was happy to share what happened to me .
And , of course , it was a small bo@@ y in my home .
I liked to share that moment with him and I am happy to tell this common memory after his death .
Just five years ago , my grand@@ mother died as a result of cancer .
One year ago , she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
That means the shock that his dem@@ ise caused the young bas@@ he@@ ir to whom I was at the time .
I have , in spite of everything , made my m@@ our@@ ning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , particularly at times when I find myself in difficulty , or when I have to take important decisions .
To call Arab@@ ic and to focus on the Middle East , to the point of turning it into a mass school , has not , with hin@@ d@@ sight , been an an@@ od@@ us choice .
In fact , I often heard him speak Arab in my childhood , and talk about Morocco , where it had lived for decades , before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values that she has accused me are still present , so I can think of how she would like me to act at some point .
The same applies to my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and spirit of the spirit of belief .
From now on , I feel it is a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent soul , a sal@@ v@@ age spirit .
I see his eyes on me .
My mother died nine@@ teen years ago .
De@@ ath by speaking on the telephone .
I have gone through all phases : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , pain , s@@ orrow that is going on alone , anywhere , when , in un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited places , in@@ con@@ gr@@ u@@ us times .
Then time has el@@ apsed .
The lack of , this vacuum without an answer , this need for it , to give me some reas@@ surance to the cre@@ a@@ tiveness of its soft power .
Yet it is there , there is a silent presence , it is there and it is watching me .
Every morning , I see his eyes worried , I see the h@@ alls that increase his ga@@ ze , the la@@ kes around the li@@ ps of cigarettes , the pl@@ ati@@ tu@@ des that mark the days of concern .
My mother has taken my face with me and she is watching me every morning in my mir@@ ror .
Every morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer to 43 years .
There is a constant sense of protection , and nothing serious can happen to us .
It was his promise on his pain bed , so one has gradually learned to s@@ mil@@ ing , and pronoun@@ ce his name is no longer taboo , but a comfort .
Of course , I am talking to him in the l@@ ust of night when the absence is too bad , she inv@@ ites in my dreams when the mor@@ ale has been achieved .
We feel that we have been protected and protected in difficult times , and that we have taken a step back from time to time , and we are trying to remain in the direction it had outlined .
If you have loved you very much , the absence of you can gr@@ u@@ b you out of the heart and memories .
In a way , being loved is becoming your domestic energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked .
I was unable to attend his inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ation and three weeks after his death , I was giving birth to a small bo@@ y .
If I have my sometimes different convictions , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision .
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me , it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , I do not go and I always wonder what he will think about it .
I do not know whether I have adopted his or her way of being , or whether I am simply like him : it is genetic ?
In any case , he will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a alter@@ -@@ e@@ go , and there was no need to speak among ourselves .
In short , it is there on a daily basis .
I feel his presence and that makes me happy .
Almost 30 years ago my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I was 28 years old and our son 6 .
The immense penalty , which then inv@@ aded me , has , of course , been ton@@ ed down , but he is still close to me .
Very often he &apos; lan@@ es &apos; in my dreams in such a precise , vi@@ vi@@ d way that I am even sadd@@ ened by the fact that it was only a dream .
The other night , he asked me whether I was going , I told him no , he replied &apos; I des@@ c@@ end &apos; , but with such a real voice that I wo@@ ke up , an@@ gu@@ ed , an@@ gu@@ ish and swit@@ ched on the horse of hor@@ ses by looking everywhere , convinced that he was going to be . That is what we are doing .
I still live in the same house , and often I feel observed and I turn to see if he is not here , I know he and I speak to him .
I feel his presence here and that makes me happy .
For nothing , I would not leave this house where we were happy , or his spirit lives with me .
I have 58 years of age , as I have always lived alone , he is and will remain the love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am soci@@ able with a profession of responsibility , I am very much in my hands and I am a grand@@ mother , I am full of friends , but my heart and soul belong to her , and I am never talking to him except my son , and I am never going to go to the c@@ eme@@ tery .
Iraq : October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month since 2008 .
October 2008 was the most deadly month in Iraq .
This Friday , Baghdad published official figures : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month : 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 police officers and 44 soldiers .
This is the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President .

&apos;@@ We are not telling the world to be on our side and to support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , said Al@@ -@@ M@@ ali@@ ki on Thursday in Washington .
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled , it will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also be extended .
And what happens when a terrorism virus lives ? It is spreading .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki spoke at the US Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .

Sur@@ ve@@ ys revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of this class A drug after testing showed co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in his ha@@ ir ’ s ha@@ ir , his portfolio portfolio , and his credit cards .
Over eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought illegal information on the arrest of two men for S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough and one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into the trafficking of hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in the coun@@ ties of Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
With 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for a £ 1.5 M amount , as well as more than £ 200 000 cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be exposed .
Today , at the Li@@ ver@@ pool Court of Li@@ ver@@ pool , which works in the office of For@@ bes Solidarity lawyers located in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , has fallen into dis@@ repu@@ te after being found guilty on two counts of impe@@ di@@ ment to justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He recognized the possession of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e during a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he had been in regular contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators followed the suspect and re@@ located him to Di@@ t@@ ta ’ s home and drugs , pure to 60 % , under the lawyer ’ s du@@ st@@ bin in a black gol@@ f g@@ ate .
So@@ on after the deposit , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta , who was at a din@@ ner at E@@ wood Par@@ k ’ s so@@ cc@@ er stad@@ ium , the Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n Road C@@ lu@@ b .
The lawyer has returned home , discovered drugs , and they have telephone nine times .
The court heard that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests found trac@@ es of class A drugs in his ha@@ ir , his portfolio and his credit cards .
Di@@ t@@ ta was arrested later on , he denied using co@@ c@@ ain@@ e , and he said that he had spoken at the alleged drug of drugs because he was his cli@@ ent and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot; legal privilege &quot; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards , but they were all seized and they were taken from a ha@@ ir of ha@@ ir .
In an inter@@ rog@@ ation he said that he had an office at his home , as well as at the workplace , and that customers came to him for legal questions at home .
But the court heard evidence that he called for major actors in the drugs trade , some of whom he had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investig@@ ators knew .
prosecutor An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : ‘ If anyone has to know that the law should not be violated , it is a criminal lawyer . ’
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal lawyer , and of having become too involved with particular customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking drug , but a drug trafficking drug that provides drugs to his own lawyer .
Some of its communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer .
But it has gone far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
He has hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not honour his profession , but dis@@ hon@@ ed him .
He has moved too close to some customers , especially S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and he has allowed his independence to be compromised .
Di@@ t@@ ta denied illegal ag@@ itation and said : &apos; If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and if I wanted to provide Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not have waited until 3 p.m. , I would have done so immediately . &apos;
But after the hearing , the super@@ ste@@ w Le@@ e H@@ al@@ ste@@ ad of the Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re Poli@@ tics said : “ Mr Di@@ t@@ ta was a criminal criminal lawyer himself as he began obtaining drugs from criminal organizations . ”
His co@@ c@@ ain@@ e addiction jeopardis@@ ed him forever and made him vulnerable to the ul@@ ter@@ ior motives of the leaders of organised criminal groups who asked him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
L@@ aw@@ yers should observe the highest integrity rules and create a climate of public confidence .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta betra@@ yed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession .
The serious and organised crime unit in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re conducted the investigation into Mr Di@@ t@@ ta , who was found guilty of the three charges of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e possession and now impe@@ ding justice , showing his commitment to prosecu@@ ting criminals in court .
Let this case serve as a warning to the criminals to know that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was himself imprisoned for 14 years after he was guilty of complicity in trafficking hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years in prison for drug trafficking .
On his website , Di@@ t@@ ta held a question / response session on himself in which he said that his dream would be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his last gu@@ est to din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali and inequality would be what motiv@@ ates him to do so . We need to work .

L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Air@@ port after a sho@@ ot@@ ings
A sho@@ oting took place at L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es &apos;s international airport .
It was at the local level at 10.@@ 00 a.m. when a man opened fire .
According to the local police , there would be at least 2 injured .
It would be an employee working for the US Transport Security Administration ( T@@ SA ) and the perpetr@@ ator of fire .
The incident would have occurred at the ter@@ minal 3 , causing a wave of panic .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers and staff have rush@@ ed down to out@@ flows or to the tar@@ ma@@ c .
Very quickly , police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the draw@@ er was arrested on the ro@@ of of the airport par@@ king .
The airport is being evac@@ uated and air traffic is being cut off .
C@@ l@@ assi@@ fication for teen@@ ag@@ ers
Each time , it is the school cli@@ en@@ te@@ le that will be targeted , an initiative that had had a great deal of success during the previous season .

To these activities , ly@@ ric@@ al Ap@@ ple was added last August , with the help of the so@@ pr@@ ano col@@ or@@ ature Mari@@ e-@@ E@@ ve M@@ un@@ ger .

New requests for collective redress against the S@@ Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ ie bro@@ thers
A further request for collective redress was lod@@ ged against the S@@ Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ ie bro@@ thers , concerning sexual assa@@ ults on this occasion at the Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h Ho@@ sp@@ ital , as well as in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the testi@@ mony of the shar@@ k , who was identified as &apos; J@@ . J &apos; , which would have been obs@@ cu@@ red in the 1950 &apos;s , first in N@@ ei@@ l D@@ a@@ mo@@ -@@ N@@ ei@@ ges by his prof@@ essor the bro@@ ther , the bro@@ ther , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , and then by his wife , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , to the Or@@ k@@ en@@ ne . By Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h , where he was serving mass and when his father worked as pain@@ ter .
The first appeal was only for three institutions , and when the Rules of Procedure were announced , many people told us : &apos; I myself was there , is I can join the lawyer Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ra@@ ult , who defends the victims in both cases &apos; .
The unusual feature of the collective redress that has just been tabled is to allow complain@@ ants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ ie con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation .
At the moment , the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ ie bro@@ thers .
The alleged facts are , in general , older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the targeted institutions closed in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also points out that S@@ wi@@ e@@ k@@ r@@ ie con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation and the St Jose@@ p@@ h Ho@@ ly M@@ or@@ atory , which is a separate entity , &apos; have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &apos; , that they &apos; have exercised a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &apos; , that they were &apos; were they were &apos; . A@@ wa@@ ren@@ ess of the sexual abuse that has taken place and has stif@@ led them &apos; , and they have &apos; consci@@ ously and consci@@ ously chosen to ignore the problem &apos; .
The latest accusations are based , among other things , on letters written by the S@@ id@@ le Per@@ ri@@ o bro@@ thers &apos; lawyer , M@@ e Per@@ ri@@ in , in the 1990s , but also by the research carried out in the archi@@ ves on this subject by the Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy bro@@ ther , a former bro@@ ther of Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ all , from Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy . They have publicly denounced the abuses .
Col@@ lec@@ tive redress must first take the step of ad@@ mis@@ sibility in the Court .
Once the Court &apos;s ad@@ mis@@ sibility was accepted , the second step was taken , or the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first appeal , the S@@ wi@@ e@@ k@@ r@@ ie con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ ably before hearings were held on the substance .
Fi@@ gh@@ ting in a Trade
A fire caused serious damage to a trade in the r@@ oun@@ d-@@ up of La@@ Sal@@ le in Mon@@ tre@@ al on Thursday night on Thursday .
E@@ f@@ for@@ ts were called on on Friday , owing to a fire that declared on the ground of an Indian cat@@ ering restaur@@ ant on the D@@ ol@@ ard ’ s D@@ ol@@ ard , near the inter@@ section with the street R@@ j@@ e .
The thir@@ ty-@@ five fire bri@@ g@@ ades that were sent to the scene took almost an hour to deal with the po@@ le .
The fire &apos; caused significant damage to the structure of the building &apos; , the leader of the Mon@@ tre@@ al fire service operations , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in restaur@@ ants when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade came on the scene .
There were no w@@ ounded , but almost 20 housing , located in the first and second floor of this row of commercial premises , had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross was requested , because the residents of one of the flat@@ s could have to be temporarily lo@@ f@@ ted , indicated the S@@ I@@ M .
A great deal of opposition to medical aid to die in Congress for pal@@ lia@@ tive care
The Canadian Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical aid to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
This is an opportunity for several pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , few would like to end their days , according to a spokesman for the Canadian Association of pal@@ lia@@ tive care , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ ou@@ et@@ te .
If emphasis was placed on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the approach to eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia would become minimal .
The president of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ’ s pal@@ lia@@ tive care law also rejects the bill on medical aid to die .
If he is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ é@@ ry is worried about the consequences for the next generation .
&apos;@@ What is the sense of life &apos; , it is sorry .
The majority of pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses will refuse to help patients die , according to the Vice-@@ Chair of the pal@@ lia@@ tive H@@ ouses Alliance , Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne F@@ it@@ z@@ ub@@ back .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ ub@@ back , as head of the Ma@@ thi@@ -@@ Fran@@ co S@@ av@@ y in G@@ ati@@ ent , believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway .
We never ask ourselves : &apos; I want to die , give me a injec@@ tion &apos; .
The director of the Association of E@@ le@@ be@@ o care , R@@ ick F@@ ir@@ th , believes that Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ’ s draft law dis@@ orien@@ t@@ ates the population over the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He does not believe that the UN will follow suit .
For its part , the Liberal MEP from Gu@@ i@@ n@@ au , S@@ é@@ ph@@ ph@@ ania Valle@@ y , says that the concept of the end of life will have to be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press is un@@ worthy of the controversial media law
“ It is a frigh@@ tening country , and it is legitimate to ask : what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? ” The newspaper said by challenging the draft law and calling for it to be declared un@@ constitutional .
“ This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and p@@ uni@@ tive , and we reject it ’ , explained C@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ u , Capital Group ’ s chief executive , C@@ ap@@ it@@ tal@@ F@@ M , one of the most respected independent radio and news stations in Kenya .
He said that the new media court &apos; will always be biased because it is an extension of the government &apos; and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the world economy .
&apos;@@ I hope the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this draft law and refer it back to the Members of Parliament &apos; , he added .
According to The Sta@@ r newspaper , the new draft law will allow the government to have “ media grip ” . The Stand@@ ard has indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “ had been hard hit ” and cas@@ tig@@ ated the draft law as “ “ &quot; D@@ rac@@ onian . &quot;
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security following the attack by armed Islamists in the West@@ g@@ ate commercial centre last September .
Ken@@ yan media have aw@@ ak@@ ened the authorities ’ anger by dissem@@ inating images of video cam@@ er@@ as to which the attack on the attack supposedly rob@@ bed the luxury trade center .
The head of the police , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ o , responded by conven@@ ing two journalists and a media official to inter@@ rog@@ ate them , although the conven@@ ing was withdrawn following the release of a shield in the media .
According to the new draft law , the media may be subject to fines of up to 20 million sh@@ ill@@ ings Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &apos; radi@@ ated &apos; or of being unable to receive official press acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the assets of an offen@@ der if he has not paid his fine .
According to the D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , “ Even a single fine is enough to paraly@@ se most F@@ M stations . ”
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya &apos;s &apos; anim@@ ated blo@@ go@@ sphere &apos; .
By si@@ len@@ cing the media , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
“ Nobody will know , ” Mu@@ tu@@ ma Ma@@ thi@@ u , a journalist in The N@@ ation , wrote by describing Ken@@ yan media as a key source of control in public life .
“ L@@ ed to themselves , politicians would go bankrupt and bring us back to hunting and the co@@ ff@@ ers . ”
Ken@@ yan legislators have been targeted at the anger of the population in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the National W@@ ast@@ e Commission ’ s cuts and restored their mixed wages of about 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month , which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmac@@ ists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmac@@ ists at the L@@ av@@ al ’ s C@@ enter for Health and Social Services ( S@@ S@@ S ) has caused a great deal to the leadership of the Ci@@ ties ’ Ho@@ ly Health , and this in 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
Because of multiple retirement , maternity or short leave , the pharm@@ acy department has been heavily staff@@ ed .
There was a lack of 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , according to the head of the department , G@@ ill@@ an Be@@ au@@ d@@ and .
However , the S@@ S@@ S decided not to employ an independent workforce , which can cost up to three times as much as a full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist .
The breakdown has not been used , Mrs Be@@ au@@ d@@ and has explained .
Some of our activities have been stream@@ lined or reduced within the building system , the time that things go again .
It is true that there has been a great deal of work to interest our young people &#91; pharm@@ acy &#93; for them to come and stay here .
There was a competition of circumstances which led to the situation in the wrong situation last year .
Im@@ pro@@ vements in the situation
After this difficult period , 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 will be much easier for the S@@ S@@ S pharm@@ acy Department .
Three pharmac@@ ists have already returned to work after their maternity leave , and three other pharm@@ acies have been hi@@ red in recent months .
Furthermore , the efforts made by the department to retain fruit have borne fruit , as the four pupils present at L@@ av@@ al at L@@ av@@ al , too , decided to remain at the job of the S@@ S@@ S .
Now it is much better , the pharmac@@ ist pointed out .
By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity returns .
That will make up our depar@@ tures from last year .
The ever-@@ growing L@@ ess@@ ers
However , the situation is still difficult .
Several factors , such as the shortage of pharmac@@ ists in hospital or the pre@@ valence of young women in the profession , make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because we have a young environment that is young and employ@@ s many young women , so with pregnan@@ cies we almost always drive maternity leave when it goes well , she added .
The last year has been a lot more and there are no pharmac@@ ists who are available to replace it , so it was more difficult .
The 2@@ 2-@@ year-old to@@ p model does not begin his career in cinema by the back door .
The director L@@ ars von T@@ er chose him to emb@@ ody Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg young in N@@ y@@ am@@ om@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ c , his next film .
This g@@ lu@@ e porno@@ graphic drama , in eight chapters that will emerge in two parts ( on 1 and 8 January 2014 ) , the ero@@ tic memories of a qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ gen@@ ial qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ d@@ ar since its ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence .
St@@ ory Martin ’ s resemb@@ l@@ ance to old is striking : a b@@ rown sil@@ ver , a di@@ ap@@ h@@ ane t@@ int , and Franco-@@ British origins .
Without forgetting a certain taste of the risk : one who did not hesitate to s@@ cra@@ p g@@ los@@ sy paper will appear in situations that are far more sulph@@ ur@@ able on large scre@@ ens .
An extr@@ act from N@@ y@@ m@@ om@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ c raised the temperature into the To@@ le : St@@ ory Martin there appears to be on bed and in the middle of Shi@@ a La@@ Be@@ ou@@ f .
If the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker asked his players to put their fin@@ gers on the shel@@ f , he used X professionals for the most d@@ aring sex , and then mer@@ ged all the num@@ er@@ ically num@@ er@@ ically : star is star ; below the bel@@ t it is the swe@@ et . That is a bad thing .
From B@@ j@@ ör@@ k at Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg , Nic@@ o@@ le K@@ id@@ man , L@@ ars von T@@ ri@@ er , is used to pushing his ac@@ res into their final re@@ tren@@ ch@@ ment , always for the better .

A N@@ ar@@ good C@@ R room on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening , the first session of a film was suspended in the N@@ ar@@ good C@@ R , as a precautionary measure , following thro@@ t@@ tle pi@@ pes that were felt by the spec@@ t@@ ators .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , the head of the establishment took the evac@@ uation of the room and warned the fire bri@@ g@@ ade for a suspicious sm@@ ell .
Some 70 people have emerged from the sitting .
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not been given .
Is it bad jo@@ ke about the substance of a te@@ ar@@ y@@ mo@@ gen j@@ et ?
Or an invol@@ un@@ tary incident ?
However , the cinema management has played the principle of precau@@ tion and the safety of its clients .
The room has been postponed and everything has been put in order .
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and clients have been able to find the pleasure of the images .
On the scre@@ en alone .
It is trying to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in cement kil@@ ns .
Taking advantage of H@@ al@@ we@@ en Day , a woman tried to get two k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e hidden in c@@ ages , on Thursday morning at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ present airport .
It was when we looked at the lu@@ gg@@ age of the passenger that drugs could be detected .
Co@@ c@@ ain@@ e had been distributed in three cities , which had previously been emp@@ tied .
drugs were then transported to the Office of the Ro@@ yal Canada G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie ( G@@ R@@ C ) , which took over in this investigation .
The Canada B@@ order Services Agency ( AS@@ F@@ C ) has not revealed where the woman came to when she was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
That is part of the investigation , Mr Rob@@ y Rob@@ y , spokesman for the AS@@ F@@ C .
What I can tell you is that it came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , the border service agents at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ present Air@@ port have carried out 17@@ 3 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 co@@ c@@ ain@@ e se@@ iz@@ ures for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , the border service agents in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region carried out a total of 16@@ 53 drug se@@ iz@@ ures .
Air air travel against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli aircraft entered Lebanon &apos;s airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of this afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A ship@@ ment of S@@ -@@ 8 , short-@@ range air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new Ta@@ h@@ al aviation ra@@ id on Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli daily newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz ) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria .
The ra@@ id took place under the same circumstances on 5 July : at the time it was also an an@@ onymous American official who confirmed in C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack , this time against the Y@@ ak@@ h@@ a roc@@ ket missiles , delivered by Russia to Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Israeli officials did not hide their irrit@@ ation from Washington revealing the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s C@@ l@@ assi@@ fication
The rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora low@@ ered Ukraine &apos;s credit rating on Friday , questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic , in recession for more than a year , to cope with its financial obligations .
The country ’ s public debt notes pass to &apos; B@@ - &apos; , sin@@ king into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative outlook , with S &amp; P seeing at least one opportunity on three counts again within a year .
&apos;@@ It is less and less likely that the government &apos;s strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs &apos; , which explains the American agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine ’ s foreign-@@ exchange reserves fell 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 , and that the trend will continue .
This makes it difficult to re@@ pay loans abroad .
These reserves , to which the authorities use massive amounts to support the local currency , the h@@ ry@@ v@@ nia , collapse , the agency is increasingly likely to be de@@ valued , which would inf@@ late its external debt .
Ki@@ ev also needs liquidity to settle gas imports to Russia , which acc@@ uses him of not paying $ 8@@ 82 million .
This is bad news for the Ukrainian authorities in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour , fu@@ rious at the willingness of Ki@@ ev to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter of a contr@@ action .
Its still relatively modest debt has explo@@ ded in recent years and S &amp; P estimates at 3@@ 3.5 % of GDP , compared to less than 10 % before the crisis of 2008-@@ 2009 .
The country , with its budget deficit , has for months been calling for aid from the International Monetary Fund , which granted it in 2010 a loan of USD 15@@ .@@ 3 billion and for the time being has provided only 3.@@ 4 billion .
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tran@@ che until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , especially by raising gas prices to the population .
After a new failed mission in the country , the IMF stated this week that &quot; the important external financing needs &quot; constituted &quot; vulnerability &quot; , while at the same time pointing to &quot; signs of economic improvement . &quot;
But , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r Jo@@ ol@@ d , the Political E@@ th@@ ics C@@ enter , “ we cannot wait for a short-term improvement . ”
&apos;@@ There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-@@ election year &apos; , with the presidential elections scheduled for 2015 , an expert , inter@@ rog@@ ated by the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international climate .
In addition , it is the &apos; uncertainty &apos; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU that Brussels is dependent on the release of the opposition Yu@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .

America \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s Green F@@ late of the P@@ u@@ b@@ ic@@ -@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m merger
Al@@ li@@ ed and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m said Friday that they received no objection from the US authorities to their fusion , thus coming closer to the creation of the first World Ad@@ ver@@ tising Agency .
The merger does indeed bring the Second World Agency , O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , and the third , P@@ u@@ b@@ ill@@ is closer together .
&apos;@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m Group Group and Public Pan@@ el announced today that the deadline for examining the earlier merger announced by the P@@ u@@ b@@ ill@@ is Group and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , provided for by the Har@@ t-@@ S@@ co@@ t R@@ od@@ ino Im@@ pro@@ u@@ v@@ ance Act of 197@@ 6 , as proposed by the Har@@ t-@@ S@@ co@@ -@@ Ro@@ d@@ ino Im@@ pro@@ u@@ v@@ é of 197@@ 6 , as amended , will exp@@ ire . &apos; The two groups announce the two groups in a communi@@ qu@@ é &apos; .
They state that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the S@@ R deadline for the United States and the decisions on authorisation issued in other juris@@ dic@@ tions satisfy several of the conditions required for the operation to be carried out .
&apos;@@ Fu@@ sion is also conditional on other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups &apos; .
The Congolese Army hun@@ t the M@@ 23 rebels
The Congolese army ( F@@ AR@@ DC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hun@@ t the M@@ 23 rebels into the forests and the mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u ad@@ jac@@ ent to Rwanda and Uganda .
M@@ 23 appears to be on the ver@@ ge of being defeated after being driven out of loc@@ alities in the north-@@ east of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) that it has controlled since the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insur@@ gency .
&apos;@@ We are going to continue M@@ 23 and make it happen wherever it hi@@ des because it is criminals &apos; , said in Re@@ u@@ ters O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokesman for the F@@ AR@@ DC .
We must not allow them to re@@ organise themselves because they have mar@@ ty@@ red the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace .
M@@ 23 officials explained that they evac@@ uated loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure , and Ber@@ tr@@ a Bis@@ sim@@ wa , a re@@ bel@@ lion politician , said that these military set@@ backs would not change his demands for peace talks in any way .
The latter , according to the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , took up on Wednesday in K@@ amp@@ ala between the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 .
B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana h@@ ills are reported in the h@@ ills that dominate B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the last loc@@ ality in the hands of the insur@@ gents this week , as well as the R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a h@@ ill where the M@@ 23 re@@ bel@@ lion emerged in 2012 .
At their he@@ ight in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , ma@@ ster@@ piece of North Ki@@ v@@ u province , taking advantage of the government ’ s flight from the government gar@@ ris@@ on and the p@@ assi@@ vity of Mon@@ us@@ co ’ s blue hel@@ me@@ ts .
The fall of G@@ om@@ a brought the United Nations Mission in the DR@@ C , the world &apos;s largest in terms of man@@ power , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid bri@@ g@@ ade of intervention bri@@ g@@ ades made up of South African , Mal@@ tese and T@@ anz@@ anian soldiers .
For its part , the F@@ AR@@ DC Military Staff was res@@ hu@@ ff@@ led and the army went on the offensive against M@@ 23 , leading to a change in the course of the war .
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;@@ M@@ 23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predic@@ ting an expert on Congolese affairs , J@@ as@@ son Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Congo .
That would be historic – it would be the first time that the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa has managed to defeat a major insur@@ gency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DR@@ C .
UN experts accuse Rwanda , which is fier@@ cely den@@ ies , of military support for M@@ 23 , which was made up of former Congolese soldiers muti@@ l@@ ated .
British diplomacy leader Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague invited Rw@@ and@@ an President Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to exercise restraint , announced a Foreign Office spokesman .
Last week K@@ ig@@ ali mentioned the possibility of military re@@ pris@@ als following the sh@@ ell@@ s falling into Rw@@ and@@ an territory .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana took over the streets of the execu@@ tion@@ er to welcome the entry of the soldiers of the F@@ AR@@ DC .
&apos;@@ We lived a year with M@@ 23 and it seemed un@@ imagin@@ able to us to be liber@@ ated one day by the army , &apos; testi@@ fies to an inhabit@@ ant of that neighbouring town of Uganda .
&apos;@@ We lived in terror ( of M@@ 23 ) , we were tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tised &apos; , he added that man .
The tests carried out by the Pa@@ ste@@ ur Institute on a patient suspected of infected by cor@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ us have proven negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &apos; the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only cases confirmed in France so far &apos; .
On Tuesday , this 4@@ 3-@@ year-old patient was suspected of being achieved , after having returned from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed fifty deaths .
Ch@@ ev@@ ron , the second US oil company , on Friday reported a decline in its quar@@ terly profits due to the decline in its refin@@ ing margins , while its production of oil and gas rose while remaining behind the group ’ s objectives .
Its net third-@@ quarter benefits fell to $ 4.@@ 95 billion , or $ 2.@@ 57 per Action , compared to $ 5.@@ 25 billion , or $ 2.@@ 69 per year per year .
An@@ aly@@ sts inter@@ viewed by Re@@ u@@ ters , on average , tru@@ sted a $ 2.@@ 71 dollar profit .
The group has produced 2.@@ 59 million bar@@ rel@@ s of oil equivalent per day in the quarter , rising compared to the 2.@@ 52 million b@@ j produced a year ago .
The company is targeting 2.@@ 65 million animals for this year , with a 25 % growth in output expected by 201@@ 7 .
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas projects in Australia .
As a result of the cost of these projects , annual investment spending increased by USD 7 billion over two years and is expected to reach $ 3@@ 6.@@ 7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities have decreased slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of down@@ stream activities ( including refin@@ ing and chemical production ) have fallen from 45 % to $ 3@@ 80 million .
This reduction in refin@@ ing margins affects the whole sector .
Thus , Ch@@ ev@@ ron ’ s main competi@@ tor , Ex@@ xon Mob@@ il , reported on Thursday of a net net benefit , despite rising gas and oil production .

&apos;@@ There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested &apos; , explaining Mrs Le@@ f@@ in .

The organisation only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint .
The C@@ losing of H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God ’ s E@@ mer@@ gency
Faced with the fron@@ t@@ loading carried out several months ago by some staff and several trade unions , whose C@@ G@@ T , the Minister for Health , Mar@@ is@@ ol T@@ our@@ ain@@ e , decided on 10 July to &apos; lag behind the timetable for implementing the project and , in particular , the date of closure of emergencies which will not be able to take place on 4 November &apos; .
An officially made request &apos; to run no risk of dealing with emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &apos; , but which was also intended not to hinder the PS campaign just a few months away from the municipal authorities .
Despite ministerial instructions , the closure should nevertheless take place on that date .
Even if , in the A@@ P@@ P , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As from 4 November , the fi@@ re-@@ fighters from around 40 of the 40 000 annual pass@@ ages to H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God ’ s ur@@ gencies were all instruc@@ ted to take the 30 serious cases every day to the ur@@ gencies of other Paris hospitals .
The date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of inter@@ na@@ tives .
H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God , the ur@@ gencies speci@@ alising in ur@@ gencies will leave five internal medical products in place on Monday .
The transfer of the be@@ ds of internal medicine is scheduled for the course of the month .
The &apos; H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God &apos; emergency service must be shut down in the shor@@ test possible time , and for us it is 4 November , the chairman of the A@@ P@@ P Med@@ ical Med@@ ical Committee ( EM@@ C ) , with the chairman of the A@@ P@@ P Med@@ ical Committee , which supports the management project . .
&apos;@@ On 4 November there will be no patients brought by fire fighters , only people from their own means &apos; , confirming Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical chief of the new Ho@@ th@@ el@@ -@@ God .
&apos;@@ But we will continue to receive emergency patients &apos; , he temp@@ ts , claiming the permanent presence of S@@ M@@ U@@ R vehicles on the ground to transfer serious cases .
Sen@@ ior doctors are going to remain on the ground , and he also as@@ sures us .
However , it is up to the L@@ R@@ A to decide on the closure of the emergency service for emergencies .
&quot; Things are being done gradually &apos; , Mr Pé@@ j@@ u &apos;s spokes@@ person for the AR@@ S for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in service terms &apos; .
&apos;@@ The Minister li@@ ed or li@@ ed to him &apos; , deplo@@ res the emergency doctor G@@ ér@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek .
From its post as leader of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R in early July , for leading the fron@@ t@@ loading against the draft re@@ organisation , it defined itself as a &apos; alert &apos; in the face of a &apos; cynical &apos; decision taken by &apos; the fo@@ cal administrative techno@@ structure &apos; .
&apos;@@ They are emp@@ t@@ ying and as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ating the ur@@ gencies that were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &apos; , he believes .
For him , “ if the other Paris emergency services were able to absorb the surplus , there would be no problem . ”
However , they are regularly eng@@ ul@@ fed .
For example , there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for L@@ ari@@ bo@@ is@@ ers &apos; ur@@ gencies .
To the L@@ R@@ A , it is argued that 30 &quot; dis@@ pat@@ ch@@ ized &quot; patients in several sites are not likely to represent an &quot; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &quot; in other emergency services , whose human resources will also have been strengthened .
To the AR@@ S and A@@ PH@@ P , the &apos; new hosp@@ it@@ ality model &apos; has already been introduced since 7 October and is expected to continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , liberal general doctors should also be involved in setting up a &apos; permanent permanent care perman@@ ence &apos; .
&apos;@@ Where are we going to ask the people to diagno@@ se &apos; , to question G@@ ér@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek for whom &apos; the not serious emergency concept &apos; is &apos; dangerous &apos; and marks a &apos; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &apos; .
This will happen as in the case of maternity hospitals at level 3 .
People are not cra@@ zy , they will go where there is the best offer of care .
If the Minister does not take action by Monday , we are going to change the po@@ et , fore@@ going Chris@@ top@@ her P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , an emergency doctor and a member of the C@@ G@@ T Health .
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list .
In N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e K@@ os@@ ci@@ us@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ ori@@ z@@ et ’ s team , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , Paris ’ s U@@ M@@ P , and the elected 4@@ th ar@@ dent , makes it clear that , “ Even if the Paris C@@ U@@ P was in order to maintain H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God ’ s ur@@ gencies , it would be technically good . As well as being financially impossible to reopen them if we go back to the responsibilities &apos; .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the Socialist candidate , again reminded France on Monday morning that it declared itself in favour of a moratorium so that no closure was made on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark her net disagreement , highlighted by B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , his spokesman .
Although the restructuring of H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God has its legitimacy on the substance , we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama En@@ d the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicating a US official on Thursday .
This decision is part of the White House ’ s attempt to take over the N@@ SA ’ s e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping case after the former analy@@ st Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations in Russia .
This is the first time that the intelligence agency has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal .
When asked about the subject , a US administration official replied : &quot; The US does not carry out electronic surveillance of the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &quot; .
Speaking under an@@ onym@@ ity , this official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past .
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered an end to these practices over the past few weeks .
This in@@ struction was given almost at the same time as that of ending the ta@@ pping of the UN ’ s headquarters in New York .
In this context , the Senate Int@@ elli@@ gence Int@@ elli@@ gence Commission on Thursday approved tighter controls on government surveillance programs , but allowed them to continue .
The committee has introduced new data restrictions which intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and have imposed a five-year limit for the retention of such information .
The UN welcomes the new objectives for combating poverty
The United Nations will now begin to work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( M@@ DGs ) , which were set up 12 years ago to combat world poverty .
Austr@@ ali@@ an diplomats have played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” aimed at replacing the M@@ DGs , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development , which began on the eve of Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They were included in the final preliminary draft of the document , which will be adopted by the world &apos;s leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to “ go beyond national interests . ”
&apos;@@ I am glad that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development objectives ( O@@ D@@ D ) , ” he added .
These O@@ D@@ Cs will rely on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to discharge the mandate I have been given by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the M@@ DGs .
Mozambique ’ s security concerns are growing at the same time as there are powerful conflicts between powerful people .
According to the stat@@ ue of S@@ am@@ a M@@ ach@@ el , the founding president of Mozambique , in the process of to@@ ying them , thousands of people gathered in the M@@ ap@@ u@@ to centre to sh@@ out peaceful slog@@ ans at a rare public demonstration .
‘ We want peace to return ; we want stability ’ , has declared V@@ an@@ ess@@ a of Sou@@ sa , a general direc@@ tor of an investment society .
Concer@@ ned for his country ’ s future , she has exchanged her working clo@@ thes against a T@@ -@@ shir@@ t with the “ we want security ” in Portuguese before joining the crow@@ ded crow@@ d on the capital ’ s place of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital .
For two weeks , there has been almost every day reports of conflict between government forces and Ren@@ <unk> , the worst c@@ ali@@ bre since the peace agreement was signed over 20 years ago .
The Ren@@ <unk> was once a famous rebel movement , initially supported by white R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia , and then South Africa ’ s apar@@ theid government as part of efforts to destabili@@ ze the country ’ s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
An@@ aly@@ sts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
The challenge for the growing economy is considerable , since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-@@ west could attract more than $ 50 million of investment over the next few years from companies like Rio T@@ into , V@@ ale , Italy , and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko . The United States .
F@@ re@@ m@@ o , the governing party and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and Ren@@ <unk> reject responsibility for tensions .
Ren@@ <unk> dec@@ la@@ res that the government origin@@ ated in the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , a traditional bas@@ tion of Ren@@ <unk> , on October 17 .
The assa@@ ults on the former rebels then de@@ generated when government forces attacked the bases of the Ren@@ <unk> and tried to kill A@@ f@@ on@@ so D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama , the group leader , and Fer@@ nan@@ do Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , the Financial Times ’ s spokesman .
The government makes Ren@@ <unk> responsible responsible for spar@@ king conflicts , and acc@@ using him of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za sought to minim@@ ize concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told the A@@ F@@ P , the French press agency , that Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama considered himself a &apos; los@@ er &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government &apos; .
F@@ re@@ m@@ o and Ren@@ <unk> insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern has grown after Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that the Ren@@ <unk> re@@ linqu@@ ished the 1992 peace agreement .
He told F@@ T@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by F@@ re@@ m@@ o .
&apos;@@ We want to resume negotiations , but with the greatest seriousness &apos; , Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a has indicated .
Pre@@ vious discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions fu@@ elled by a series of conflicts this year .
“ Two great men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama ) who don ’ t stop squ@@ ab@@ bling , explained Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ an@@ l@@ on , a conf@@ er of Mozambique ’ s open and specialist university .
None of them are willing to negotiate and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
The Ren@@ <unk> , which is in favour of electoral reform , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a trea@@ sure trea@@ sure .
The percentage of the votes collected by the Ren@@ <unk> has continued to fall since 1992 , while a new party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( M@@ D@@ M ) , which was created by a former Ren@@ <unk> member , was set to get more votes in elections .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – who is expected to leave at the end of his second term in office next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&apos;@@ He does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency &apos; , said Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Ren@@ <unk> is , but it has carried out disrup@@ tive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-@@ south motor@@ way axis .
Most of the c@@ lic@@ h@@ és took place in the So@@ fa@@ a province , which is located several hundred kilometres north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where Be@@ ira , where mining companies , notably Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale , export coal .
In June , Rio could no longer use the railways for about a week after Ren@@ <unk> threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was fal@@ sely ti@@ mid when asked whether Ren@@ <unk> would re@@ ne@@ ge on this threat .
Ren@@ <unk> wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , ” Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
In@@ stability has strengthened the fru@@ stra@@ tions of the government , declaring Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , an independent media society , many people who are also concerned about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
“ People believe that those responsible for the country ’ s future are the government and the president , and that it is up to him to find solutions to the problems ’ , he explained .
Om@@ ar Su@@ ul@@ u@@ ane , one manife@@ station , said that people only wanted stability .
“ Nobody ca@@ res about Ren@@ <unk> or F@@ re@@ m@@ o , they just want to return to peace , they want to have free access to roads , ” he added .
my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds to children should be taught as “ models of life style , ” the author says .
T@@ ho@@ or ’ s Le@@ g@@ en@@ de could show that “ the brutal force does not carry the weight in the face of sub@@ tle ru@@ se , ” while ar@@ th@@ ur@@ ian le@@ gen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
Having said that many my@@ ths would be “ far too violent , far too scandalous , and in some cases far too ob@@ scene to be taught at school , ” Croati@@ an-@@ Holland has advocated “ careful selection ” of suitable age .
“ I think it is wonderful that in America , my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education ’ .
I have been arguing in favour of this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “ openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic ” means that children “ get away completely , ” messages being “ su@@ c@@ ked ” in pleasant stories .
B@@ us@@ le@@ y@@ -@@ Holland , who has translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon and wrote The Pen@@ gu@@ in Bo@@ ok of Nor@@ th@@ s and British Fol@@ k , said : &apos; You may have good intentions , but you want to keep them out of sight . ”
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope .

The basis for what is known and not said is known .
A figh@@ ter from the Hamas army was killed this evening and another w@@ ounded by an Israeli t@@ ank fired in the Gaza Strip has been learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .

E@@ th@@ ics of the N@@ SA : the US is “ gone too far , ” ad@@ mitting Ker@@ ry .
The US has sometimes gone too far on sp@@ ying , acknowledged Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in this first po@@ le@@ m@@ ic Washington conf@@ ession with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the US and its European allies , this is the first time that a US government official explicitly ad@@ mits controversial practices in inter@@ c@@ eption by the N@@ SA of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;@@ In some cases , as the President has said , some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to ensure that this does not happen in the future &apos; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London which he attended since Washington on Thursday 31 October by video link .
In his speech , which was referred to in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , the head of American diplomacy had long justified intelligence practices and information collection by means of the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ king the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 , and those in London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry assured that the US authorities had had many plans for attacks , thanks to the inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and the collection of information .
&apos;@@ We made it impossible for aeroplan@@ es to fall , buildings did not explo@@ de and people were murdered because we were able to know about these projects up@@ stream &apos; , argued the bos@@ s of American diplomacy .
And , as John Ker@@ ry said to the Europeans , &apos; I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been mis@@ led &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;@@ And yes , in some cases it has gone too far &apos; , has admitted to the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal last week in Paris , London and Rome .
On Thursday , he assured him that President Obama was &apos; intent on trying to clarify and re@@ visit these practices so that nobody feels dec@@ eived &apos; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data of hundreds of millions of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o users .
The newspaper , which c@@ ites documents obtained from the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , states that the programme known as &apos; M@@ U@@ S@@ C@@ U@@ LA@@ R &apos; , and led by the British N@@ SA counterpart , G@@ C@@ H@@ Q , allows these two agencies to recover . data from the op@@ tical fi@@ b@@ res used by the Internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , around 18@@ 1 million elements were collected in the only month of last January - from me@@ als on e-@@ ma@@ ils , parts of text or audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ c@@ eption would take place outside the US .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , or Italy have revealed that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted massive data and communications from allies of the US and their leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states , while US press lea@@ ks claimed that the US President was not aware of such e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping , Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
On the other hand , the bos@@ s of the powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ e@@ ith Alexander , denied him that his intelligence agency cap@@ tured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even s@@ acked the ball to the European intelligence services who had seized these communications before supplying them to the N@@ SA .
This would be about “ military operations ” in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the US , and that would not be Europe ’ s goal , but General Alexander .
And the po@@ le@@ m@@ ic spread to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia has called the Austr@@ ali@@ an Ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international es@@ pion@@ age network , which has also provoked China .
The St Ger@@ hand Paris Paris will receive L@@ ori@@ ent Friday without its master , the Swed@@ e Z@@ á@@ tan I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , announ@@ ces League 1 club in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
The P@@ S@@ G , the leader of the cham@@ pion@@ ship in Mon@@ ac@@ o in contrast to goals , broadcast the list of players detained for this 12@@ th day match , with no attack on it for 32 years .
The communi@@ qu@@ é simply states that it is &apos; injured &apos; , without specifying the nature of the injury .
However , he was suffering from an inf@@ lam@@ mation of the left when he returned to selection at the beginning of this month .
A ceremony in memory of the dec@@ e@@ ased de@@ pu@@ ties
The Pre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the L@@ ash@@ ise organis@@ es , at 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the dec@@ e@@ ased creat@@ ors in his establishment during the year .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , who is a socialist candidate at the Paris City City , has to attend , and will then explain , at a press conference , his proposals for a fun@@ eral .
To follow the ceremony , there is a c@@ lic@@ k of it .
For their own shad@@ ows , more and more French people choose creativity , rather than in@@ hum@@ ation : 53 % , according to a I@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people , instead of 47 % .
For the fun@@ eral , the opposite is the case : the French prefer in@@ hum@@ ation ( 53 % to 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book The De@@ ath De@@ ath , Dam@@ en Le Gu@@ ay , the philosop@@ her and vice-@@ chairman of the National fun@@ eral Committee on E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &quot; violence &quot; represented by the creation , for the survi@@ v@@ ors .
There is , with the creation , &apos; violence against the loved body &apos; , which will be &apos; reduced to a p@@ ile of ash &apos; in a very short space of time , and not after a process of dec@@ ay , which would &apos; accompany the stages of the m@@ our@@ ning &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which is due to the &apos; er@@ ron@@ eous &apos; and distinc@@ tive signs &apos; reduced to the &apos; an@@ onym@@ ity &apos; of ash .
Why is it that what has been accepted without difficulty in some of the Nordic countries and Pro@@ te@@ stant countries is still poorly lived in France ?
&apos;@@ Because the creation is new &apos; , Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ri@@ que B@@ ac@@ é , President of the Th@@ an@@ at@@ ology Society and author of the book Ap@@ pri@@ vo@@ ise of the Bo@@ ok of Th@@ an@@ at@@ or@@ ic De@@ ath .
It has only been tolerated since 196@@ 3 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to learn it .
It is for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mic@@ ha@@ d-@@ N@@ er@@ ard , the managing director of the fun@@ eral service in the V@@ ill@@ es de Paris V@@ ill@@ es , to call for a ceremony as worthy as the one he would have with in@@ hum@@ ation for the de@@ vil .
The annual investigation of I@@ p@@ so@@ s shows a very strong commitment to organising the ceremony .
77 % of French people want one , for their families , whether they are religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of those who have chosen a creative age want a ceremony .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s want it as well .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ a have adapted to this society ’ s development .
&apos;@@ For a decade and a half , they have been trying to prevent families from waiting for violence , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the surrender of the ash &apos; .
70 % of the institutions now offer ma@@ sters of cere@@ monies , who , in the presence of the body , have the following rit@@ ual : welcome the assembly , nam@@ ing the dec@@ e@@ ased , linking it to others , raising it , giving meaning to his death , organising good@@ by@@ e .
This is the case with Fa@@ ther L@@ ash@@ ise &apos;s cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um since 1998 .
The ceremony ma@@ sters are often people who have been converted .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that the Pre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the L@@ ash@@ ise , since 2010 , is organising several cere@@ monies of secular and non-@@ religious memory , to which it inv@@ ites the families of the people who have been created in the year .
For the second con@@ secu@@ tive year , one of these cere@@ monies is forwarded to those who cannot travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um has allowed us to pass it on .
In La Se@@ ey@@ ne , re@@ housing for r@@ ats is po@@ le@@ m@@ ical .
Ear@@ lier this week , a family left its a@@ partment on the ground squ@@ ads of the F@@ ru@@ ti@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 building , owing to the presence of r@@ ats .
Faced with the urgency of the situation , the director of the T@@ wars H@@ ab@@ it@@ at South office has proposed , exceptional and temporary , to reloc@@ ate the couple and his three children in a new T@@ 4 .
However , the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons &apos; and the situation is blocked .
The matter has taken on excessive proportions , the Director of the office of the head of the office has been estimated by Jo@@ el Can@@ ap@@ a .
There have been r@@ ats , there have always been them in cities .
The proc@@ lam@@ ation company carries out two pass@@ ages per year , and , furthermore , we intervene at every request from the inhabitants .
Since the end of last winter , we have made 64 speeches .
The neigh@@ bor@@ hood is not left to abandon , and the r@@ ats do not get into the city .
For reasons of environmental protection and public health , proc@@ ra@@ st@@ ination products are four times less effective than in the past , of course , but for two r@@ ats , one is not going to kill a taste .
&apos;@@ We have not invited the r@@ ats at home &apos; , defending the father of the family who have left his house to settle in the ho@@ tel .
We are soon without sole and we expect new housing , at the same price as the old one .

Oil prices continue to fall and are $ 96 per bar@@ rel .
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday , while concerns about the importance of stocks outw@@ ei@@ gh a report showing that China ’ s electricity g@@ as-@@ gu@@ zz@@ ling manufacturing sector is growing .

The contract lost 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it with a 5.@@ 8 % reduction in October .
The abund@@ ant supply of crude oil has weigh@@ ed the price in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by over 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on China ’ s manufacturing sector on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China ’ s economic recovery could continue to grow after growth grew to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter .
G@@ rent , a reference for international crude already used by American refin@@ eries , lost 26 c@@ ents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 per bar@@ rel on the Inter@@ -@@ Con@@ tent Ex@@ change ( IC@@ E ) in London .
The right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as
A federal court of appeal restored to T@@ ex@@ as some restrictions on the voluntary termination of pregnancy which had been blocked by a first-@@ instance judge this week .
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in this state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The judgment of the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that doctors who will practice I@@ V@@ G will have to have a &apos; admission privilege &apos; with local hospitals .
The admission privilege is the right of a doctor , under his status as a hospital member , to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to issue diagnosis or treatment .
Sup@@ porters of I@@ V@@ G argue that the content of the law is likely to result in the immediate closure of one-third of state clin@@ ics , because these clin@@ ics have failed to obtain the “ admission privilege ” for their practi@@ tioners .
A total of 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women would be deprived of access to these institutions .
On Monday , a judge of the first instance took the view on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were anti-@@ constitutional .
But the T@@ ex@@ as General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who holds the post of govern@@ or , asked the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to cancel the judgment of first instance that blocked the law .
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January .
New Sta@@ r achieved a return of strength , with audi@@ ences , with 1.3 million view@@ ers behind their television station , or 5.@@ 6 % of the audience .
But was it going to come to an end ?
Some 10 000 candidates have come to the hearings for this 10@@ th season , to face the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ e , the m@@ ic@@ ked S@@ inc@@ l@@ i , the An@@ dr@@ é Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
As a result of the exc@@ itement to return to their fav@@ our@@ ite agenda , many were disappointed .
But why so much disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As every year , initial hearing emissions bre@@ ed a wide choice of her@@ bal sing@@ ers , for better and sometimes worse .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , you want spectac@@ le , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fortunately , some people have found them to be .
Many of them tried New Sta@@ r , sometimes even to the end .
Beh@@ ind the television scre@@ ens , successful s@@ ong@@ s are still there , season after season .

The court is blocking a decision on the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and control policy .
A federal appeal court on Thursday blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and sear@@ ches of the police department in New York and has drawn it up .
The US Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) indicated that Jud@@ ge Shi@@ ra Sch@@ ee@@ ind@@ lin ’ s decision was suspended until after the city ’ s appeal .
The judge decided in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and inter@@ rog@@ ate the citizens .
The city has appe@@ aled to its conclusions and corrective orders , including a decision to award a supervis@@ or to help the police department change its policy and the training programme associated with it .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the request for suspension .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al said that the judge had to be taken out of the dossier because it infring@@ ed the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , partly due to a series of inter@@ views granted to the media and public statements in which it was publicly reacting to the criticism of the Court . .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and His@@ panic origin as part of their control and search programme .
It has appointed an external supervis@@ or to supervise the changes , including the reform of policies , training and supervision , and it has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test body cam@@ er@@ as in areas where the greatest number of checks are carried out .
In August , New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of those whose case was rejected after police control .
The hearing of the call by the city should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The tactics of control and sear@@ ches have been criticised by many civil rights defenders .
This system of checks and sear@@ ches has been in place for decades in some form , but the number of checks registered has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ berg , to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls that mainly concerned black men and h@@ is@@ ters of H@@ is@@ k origin in 2011 . panic .
Ju@@ dic@@ ial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Those who argue for changes in N@@ Y@@ P@@ D ’ s control and sear@@ ches say that they will end unfair practices , have more effective and tru@@ sted police forces , and be able to change the way police departments use politics .
Op@@ ponents say that these changes would undermine police mor@@ ale without reducing crime , would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police officers have been greatly reduced over the last decade .
The judge stressed that she did not end control and sear@@ ches , which are constitutional , but reform the way in which the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its controls .
The ten@@ ants must go to vote , because each of them pay on average $ 100 per month on the price of housing that goes to V@@ ille .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ ,000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des this amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes .
By voting , we are sending out a clear message .
We need to make a difference to the V@@ ill@@ es .
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay for $ 100 000 , a land from $ 4 million to $ 5 million in case ...
C@@ ome on to vote , this is the best way to express you and say that it is enough .

The four housing buildings on the 15 streets of He@@ br@@ ert have been the subject of three al@@ arms to the fire service .

France Vo@@ is@@ le , spokesman for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c fire protection service , made it clear that the rapid intervention of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade prevented the fl@@ ames from spreading to ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where the buildings are constructed in a closer manner .

C@@ ou@@ l@@ on used the Internet to check a pi@@ e
The former ed@@ itor of Ne@@ ws of the World An@@ dy C@@ ou@@ l@@ son would have used “ ha@@ cking , surveillance , and confrontation , ” to try to confirm a bic@@ ycle pi@@ pe on a link involving the then Minister for Home Affairs , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
The Prosecutor An@@ drew E@@ se Q@@ C told the O@@ ld B@@ ai@@ ley Tribunal that Ne@@ ws of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ anna@@ h P@@ w@@ l@@ by , his “ beautiful special coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . ”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper asked G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ c@@ aire , a private detec@@ tive , to pir@@ ate P@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s voice , and to “ keep his back on his do@@ or@@ step ” , but C@@ ou@@ l@@ son also called it and gave him voice messages .
&apos;@@ The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ ou@@ l@@ son , who is now the ed@@ itor of N@@ ot@@ t@@ W , is not the kind of man to remain before the people &apos;s house , hoping that they may be surprised , it is the kind of man to present history to the people to see what they say &apos; , Mr E@@ say , it is a matter of urgency .
He said that N@@ ot@@ t@@ W used three ways to investigate the issues : telephone ha@@ cking , surveillance , and confrontation .
The ed@@ itor is personally involved in the third .
It is clear that he is aware of the second , surveillance , and it cannot be any other way .
But what about the first ?
Is he aware of the ha@@ cking of telephone numbers ?
It says the opposite , but we say &apos; of course if &apos; .
R@@ um@@ ours on a C@@ lar@@ ke link were first taken up by the No@@ t@@ W des@@ k office when a source , with a sexual attr@@ action to M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by , said that he had been told : “ Do not lose your time with her , she is with Charles . ”
A g@@ ang , on which pir@@ ated messages were recorded on his telephone at least three times , was seized in Mul@@ c@@ aire ’ s house in August 2006 .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ators also found se@@ iz@@ ures on the private detec@@ tive computer that related to M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by and her s@@ ister , who had been on a &apos; project &apos; dossier .
During the period when the detec@@ tive investigated her , M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls for information on her , added Mr E@@ d@@ is .
Meanwhile , the former chief re@@ porter N@@ ev@@ ille Th@@ ur@@ le@@ bec@@ k and the former def@@ er@@ ment James We@@ a@@ ther@@ u@@ p over@@ saw the surveillance of M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s min@@ us@@ cu@@ le and gest@@ ures .
In a voice that he gave him on 18 June 2005 , C@@ ou@@ l@@ son said : ‘ I have a history that we intend to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk about at Charles . ’
He explained that C@@ ou@@ l@@ son ’ s involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former Interior Minister David B@@ un@@ ke@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury heard on Thursday that C@@ ou@@ l@@ son confronted Mr Bor@@ l@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t about a link with a married woman when he himself was co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ ou@@ l@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny that he con@@ spi@@ red with others to pir@@ ate tele@@ phones between October 3 and 9 August 2006 .

Barack Obama ’ s Prime Minister , in the midst of an outbreak of violence
On Friday , 1 November 2013 , US President N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest violence over the past five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday 1 November .
9@@ 64 people died in the violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 police officers and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN gives an even higher balance sheet with 9@@ 79 dead and 1 9@@ 02 injured .
This violence is becoming more deadly , despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations that have been launched for months by N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki ’ s government , dominated by the Shia .
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people were killed .
Two years after US troops were withdrawn , the level of violence has led to a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation , while neighb@@ oring Syria is pre@@ y to civil war .
bombs hit markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ erals .
Men are killed on the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s to be politically marginalised and to be the target of unjust arrests , has encouraged this outbreak of violence .
On Friday , new violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad .
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( I@@ I@@ I@@ L ) , a group aff@@ ili@@ ated with al-@@ Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , also involved in Syria ’ s civil war .
N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants a “ global war ” against al-@@ Qaeda .
The violence is at the center of talks in the United States of Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting on December 12 , 2011 .
At the time , the US President , elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country , pain@@ ted an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since he arrived in Washington on Wednesday , N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki has multi@@ plied the meetings with the executive , and elected representatives of Congress .
On Thursday he argued for the international community to conduct a &apos; third world war &apos; against al-@@ Qaeda .
The principle of increased support for Iraq in terms of security is supported by Sen@@ ior Republican and Democratic Sen@@ ators .
But they also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a Shia , giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his “ sec@@ tarian and authoritarian policy . ”
They also demanded that Barack Obama make N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki understand that “ Iran ’ s per@@ nic@@ ious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . ”
Beijing acc@@ uses a U@@ igh@@ ur group of the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men attack
The Chinese internal security leader , on Friday , accused a group of U@@ igh@@ ur separati@@ sts of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang to be behind the car bomb attack that killed five in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V , s@@ ank over the crow@@ d of the Chinese capital , the symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression carried out in 1989 , and sho@@ oting its three passengers and two smugg@@ lers .
Den@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the political office responsible for internal security , accused the Islamic movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan to be the instig@@ ator of this attack .
Many U@@ igh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ speaking minority in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese Tur@@ ke@@ stan province .
For the Chinese government , this movement is responsible for frequent erup@@ tions of violence that occur there by demands for independence .
&apos;@@ The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organised and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &apos; , &apos; M@@ en@@ g at the Hondur@@ an chain P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x TV . &apos;
&quot; The group that took place behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan &quot; , he added his remarks , which were taken up by the new China agency .
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests it was U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur and made it clear that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also included contain@@ ers full of petrol and flag with Or@@ thodox religious en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment .
The incident led to 42 injured .
The Islamic movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on contrac@@ eption , divorce , and homosexu@@ ality
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has undertaken a major survey around the world about how the par@@ ks manage sensitive issues such as contrac@@ eption , divorce , and sa@@ me-@@ sex couples .
The poll asked participants how pri@@ ests care about gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage links .
The poll was sent to each national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , in mid-@@ October , to get as many answers as possible .
Information will be used for an important family meeting to be held next year by Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is .
The news was reported on Thursday by the &apos; National Ca@@ thol@@ ic Re@@ porting &apos; , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokes@@ person for the Catholic Conference of Catholic B@@ ish@@ ops in the United States has confirmed that the document is auth@@ enti@@ c and that every Bis@@ ho@@ p decides on the appropriate way to look at the par@@ is@@ hi@@ ans .
In the United Kingdom , b@@ ish@@ ops have published the Internet survey by asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .
D@@ DR@@ : The army attacks the final str@@ and of the rebels
M@@ 23 M@@ 23 , or several hundred combat@@ ants , were entren@@ ched at nearly 2000 metres of al@@ titude in Chancellor , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i , and M@@ bu@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ om@@ b@@ a , two loc@@ alities located around 80 km north of the North ’ s B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana . G@@ om@@ a , the capital of North Ki@@ v@@ u province .
&apos;@@ It has not ceased since this morning , the fighting is continuing in spite of the night &apos; , told the A@@ F@@ P an inhabit@@ ant of J@@ om@@ b@@ a , joint by telephone at 12.@@ 30 p.m. , and according to which a gir@@ l was shot by a shot in the morning .
&apos;@@ The intensity of the clashes fell somewhat , he added &apos; it seems that the F@@ ARC For@@ ces For@@ ces of the DR@@ C have pushed the rebels a little &apos; .
According to this witness wishing to remain an@@ onymous , the soldiers had &apos; spent the night in J@@ om@@ b@@ a before playing the front for a &apos; operation of rac@@ ing &apos; .
There was quite a lot of talk behind him of small f@@ ads of light weapons .
An A@@ F@@ P journalist from B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the political fi@@ ef@@ dom and last place of the re@@ bel@@ lion , was able to hear heavy arms de@@ ton@@ ations .
According to one source of the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DR@@ C , the fighting has entered &apos; a final phase &apos; , with the F@@ ARC having &apos; surrounded the M@@ 23 resid@@ ual positions to remove them &apos; .
E@@ ver since the resumption , on Friday , of the clashes between the Movement of 23 M@@ ars ( M@@ ars ) and the army , Mon@@ us@@ co is not participating directly in the fighting , but it is providing the government troops with decisive support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several dozen soldiers , well supplied with am@@ muni@@ tion , went to the front line .
They were armed with k@@ al@@ ash@@ ni@@ kov and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road to B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , the border post with Uganda , ai@@ ded military personnel charged a multi@@ fac@@ eted roc@@ ket charge on a fl@@ at nine of the F@@ AR@@ DC , with a view to taking over another gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic sw@@ im@@ ming p@@ ouring into the M@@ oun@@ t M@@ oun@@ t &apos;s positions . 23 on the h@@ ills .
The Congolese President , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , has once again called on the rebels to &apos; voluntarily demo@@ bili@@ ze &apos; the pain of being dis@@ armed &apos; by force &apos; , but has let the K@@ amp@@ ala process opened , where Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been discussing since December without any result for the sake of it . Now .
The M@@ 23 political leaders on the ground hope to reach an agreement .
&apos;@@ We finished the talks , the Ug@@ and@@ an mediation was to organise the signing &apos; , as Ro@@ ger Lu@@ um@@ ba@@ a , vice-@@ chairman of the delegation of M@@ 23 , said , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
M@@ 23 was born of a mut@@ iny , in April 2012 , of former rebels , essentially T@@ ut@@ si , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ali and K@@ amp@@ ala refu@@ te .
North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ soil is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mining resources .
In B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where around 5 000 people took refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the movement back to the DR@@ C that took place in the morning reversed in mid-@@ day .
We told the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ ul@@ i , the A@@ F@@ P N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ ul@@ i , surrounded by its nine children , with the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ ul@@ i .
One gets the impression that sho@@ ts are coming closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of inhabitants were crossing the border , some with a mat@@ el@@ as on the head , to spend the night in Uganda .
The mu@@ si@@ cal Com@@ edi@@ e@@ e
C@@ l@@ assi@@ fied , sophisticated , popular , English or French produc@@ tions , d@@ an@@ cing and d@@ an@@ cing , take off .
After Bro@@ ad@@ ay and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It is a revolution : the French mu@@ si@@ cal is asser@@ ting itself as a success story .
For a long time , from No@@ x de Paris to Moz@@ art the oper@@ a oper@@ a oper@@ a oper@@ a oper@@ a oper@@ a oper@@ a company ro@@ ck , most attempts are being made to become lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous .
And the successes such as C@@ ab@@ ar@@ et or the Mis@@ si@@ es have been a myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ lin in Ch@@ â@@ t@@ let and S@@ age - and in Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or has changed the situation .
Today , these two scenes are a success story .
The first is this Christmas , his excellent M@@ y F@@ air Lad@@ y , and he announ@@ ces the world creation of &apos; an American in Paris to Paris &apos; .
In Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or , &apos; B@@ le and Be@@ ast &apos; may well be one of the success stories of the season .
On the other scenes , mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les like &apos; 17@@ 89 &apos; , &apos; the bit@@ es of the Bas@@ til@@ le &apos; and the small mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans such as &apos; Dis@@ co &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; put themselves into line with success and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , author of the reference book &apos; History of mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans &apos; and conf@@ ers on the theat@@ re of Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ et , analyses the reasons for the hard-@@ won success .
How do French mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans evolve ?
The supply has increased considerably .
First of all , there are the &apos; mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les &apos; that evolve as producers ...
Some are using - fine projec@@ tions of images and a real history as in 17@@ 89 , the A@@ man@@ ts of the Bas@@ til@@ la .
Others are j@@ um@@ ping back 15 years on the pretext that it can be used more or less - anything when Mat@@ t - Po@@ k@@ or@@ a is head of post@@ er .
After that , we have mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans with the s@@ om@@ p@@ ous produc@@ tions of Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ and which make us repeat the golden age of Bro@@ ad@@ wal@@ ay and discover the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ d@@ he@@ im , the greatest living com@@ pos@@ er .

The French independent producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough .
However , projects under way such as &apos; Le Pen of Women Ar@@ med &apos; or &apos; The Spring A@@ ve@@ il &apos; have difficulty being funded .
Do we have enough artists like Bro@@ ad@@ y Bro@@ ad@@ y , playing and d@@ an@@ cing ?
In Paris , when there are eight mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , the cra@@ dle of the mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ um is very different .
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools .
There are many jobs between regional theat@@ res , tour@@ na@@ ments , Bro@@ ad@@ way , off@@ spring ...
The tal@@ e of talent is as large as the number of posts to be filled .
Why do the events in province have just as much success ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor relation of culture in France .
Fe@@ w theat@@ re coins go round and it is often - the theat@@ re of b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard for adults , not young adults .
mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les fill this gap .
It is these same young people who love television and what it produces as short-@@ lived st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful young men ( often tal@@ ented ) in post@@ ers of mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les is an assurance that these young girls and often their entire families will be sw@@ allowed up .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these spectac@@ les are well received by professionals who answer questions .
These spectac@@ les are very much expected when they arrive in a province of province .

One serious injured person in an accident with a gh@@ o@@ st driver on the Brussels R@@ ing
A road accident caused a serious injury , on Friday morning at 5@@ 30 a.m. , on the Brussels internal ring up to He@@ il@@ lo@@ art , in the direction of W@@ ater@@ lo@@ o .
A driver &apos;s car has been lost by a gh@@ o@@ st driver , who is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
The ring was closed until 9.@@ 00 a.m. on the accident , the time that the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
This situation has not , however , caused a great deal of congestion , because the accident took place at the he@@ ight of the Ho@@ e@@ il@@ ar@@ art exit .
It was therefore possible to devi@@ ate from this exit / entry / entry .

The N@@ SA &apos;s re@@ vel@@ ations increase the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance .
By a beautiful day at the end of August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter flying at low he@@ ight of the British Consul@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , Germany &apos;s financial capital .
In order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the German National Int@@ elli@@ gence Agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the American out@@ post , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explained that B@@ f@@ V@@ s hoped to identify the presence of listen@@ ers and that the operation gave rise to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James C@@ l@@ ap@@ er , the director of the US intelligence service , again insisted in September that the US does not use foreign intelligence to “ ste@@ al foreign secre@@ ts from foreign companies for American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ”
But since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the consul@@ tant who became whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lowing , began dis@@ covering his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble trea@@ sury of information about US surveillance secre@@ ts , European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on his word .
There have been reports that the US National Security Agency sp@@ y the Brazilian oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as , and has had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in C@@ lou@@ d , including Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , more than ever . Com@@ pan@@ ies are in favour of state surveillance .
The re@@ vel@@ ation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s telephone was pir@@ ated , perhaps for a decade , was the stra@@ w that sp@@ illed the ca@@ me@@ l ’ s back .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then business leaders are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den made transparent collaboration between US and business intelligence services transparent .
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for their mutual benefit .
“ Germany must wake up , ” O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ ü@@ n , President of B@@ I@@ T@@ M@@ i , who represents German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the US represents a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to an investigation published in July by the board E@@ Y .
However , in all the documents un@@ ve@@ iled by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there is no indication so far that the United States has sent industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Business leaders are sceptical about this .
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should set up a German Google .
I can only close our eyes and re@@ open them slowly ...
&apos;@@ This is not the right way to do it &apos; , as H@@ ass@@ o Pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the German company company , SA@@ P .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , from coal to cars , to farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ ying agencies exposed by S@@ now@@ den ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations were a shock for some companies that so far believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance .
A major change is taking place in cl@@ oud information as European officials have realised that data retained in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable .
According to an investigation carried out by the C@@ lou@@ d Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-@@ American members have given up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cl@@ ou@@ ds after re@@ vel@@ ations on the US programme for the expl@@ oration of P@@ ris@@ m data .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &apos; Our customers are asking us a question they did not ask us a year ago : where my data are kept , and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction ? &apos;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most precious secre@@ ts , and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is not surprising that there is economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There have always been .

Americans are sp@@ ying on us in commercial and industrial terms just as we es@@ p@@ ouse them , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Business leaders are usually reluctant to dis@@ close the prevention measures that they have put in place , should that leave an op@@ ponent an advantage .
Lar@@ ge companies have been ham@@ per@@ ing the message for a long time that it is , to say the least , un@@ wise to recover a key US@@ B key at a professional room or to leave an un@@ super@@ vised computer without surveillance in a ho@@ tel chamber .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ack@@ enberg , a member of the Au@@ di car manufacturer &apos;s board , states that the collection of mobile phones before council meetings , so that they cannot be used as remote e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping devices , has been common practice for years .
Germany ’ s B@@ f@@ V advis@@ es its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones pre@@ paid when travelling abroad because of the risk of damage to the smar@@ t@@ phones .
High@@ -@@ paid mobile phones are then thrown out .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and supervision .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .

The United States al@@ er@@ ts their own companies about the economic es@@ pion@@ age activities carried out by other countries .
The US National Int@@ elli@@ gence E@@ sti@@ m@@ ate ( N@@ I@@ E ) , carried out in February , cited France , as well as Russia and Israel , cul@@ p@@ able for having carried out acts of ha@@ cking of economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Po@@ st .
A member of the board of a re@@ now@@ ned German company believed that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , “ the French are the worst . ”
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ quar@@ cin@@ i , the former French Internal Int@@ elli@@ gence Director , the D@@ C@@ R@@ I , said in an interview this month : “ The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , sp@@ y on their allies . ”
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , believe that their son was murdered .
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia , whose body was found in a t@@ all struggle in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se of his high school , believe that their son was murdered , declared his family lawyer on Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , the de Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on 11 January in a pe@@ g that stood behind the gy@@ m@@ na@@ sia ’ s gra@@ des behind his high school y@@ ou@@ ths .
The S@@ her@@ i@@ ff ’ s sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff ’ s investig@@ ators concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son died under unusual circumstances , but the family of the 17 year-old bo@@ y disputed these conclusions .
“ They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered ’ , said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ um@@ p , the lawyer representative Ken@@ ne@@ th and Joh@@ n@@ son , on Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s@@ com@@ .
They never thought that he was dead , as indicated in the S@@ her@@ i@@ ff &apos;s conclusions .
“ They believe that this beg@@ g@@ ars belief , the laws of physi@@ cs and common sense , ” has added C@@ ru@@ p .
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the or those responsible for the death of their son .
“ They sent their son to school with a car@@ table , and they returned to a mor@@ tu@@ ary ba@@ g , ” he added .
The US prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore said on Thursday that he had an official investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , pointing out that several important issues remain un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
Mo@@ ore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I will follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My aim is to find out the truth .
&apos;@@ I consider that there is a sufficient basis &apos; for an official investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore told journalists that the first au@@ top@@ sy indicated that Joh@@ n@@ son had died by &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . &quot;
But a second au@@ top@@ sy identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
He said that there are a number of questions that still deserve an answer or confirmation .
Mo@@ ore added that if he un@@ ites elements that justify a civil or criminal investigation into Joh@@ n@@ son ’ s death , he will ask the F@@ B@@ I to lead it .
The representative of the S@@ her@@ i@@ ff S@@ her@@ i@@ ff office was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him on Thursday .
A South Georgia judge , on Wednesday , ordered the authorities to submit all video record@@ ings of video record@@ ings which the investig@@ ators had examined .
The teen@@ age parents of the teen@@ ag@@ er said that they had hoped that video images would contain indic@@ es of the circumstances of his death .
The C@@ C publ@@ ishes advice on aller@@ gies in children for schools .
On Wednesday , the American Centre for Dis@@ ease Control issued a series of directives on how to deal with children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publ@@ ishes , since the number of children of school age suffering from food aller@@ gies has so@@ ared .
One in 20 children in the United States is currently suffering from food aller@@ gies .
The CD@@ C discovered that the pre@@ valence of child food aller@@ gies rose by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise the awareness of children and food aller@@ gies among children , and how to deal with them in the event of aller@@ gic reaction .
It also recommends schools to have a stock of trick@@ i@@ ine – the E@@ pi@@ P@@ en brand that is most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially leth@@ al an@@ ap@@ la@@ x@@ ia .
The Member States ’ legislative assemb@@ lies recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily in stock .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms provided by children with aller@@ gic reactions .
Children can say , ‘ I get the impression that I have a language ’ , ‘ I have the impression that I have a horse on the language ’ or ‘ I have pi@@ g@@ lets on the language ’ .
The N@@ SA case under@@ scores the total absence of a debate on intelligence .
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which on one side is off@@ ending in public by conven@@ ing the United States ambassador on 21 October , and on the other hand banned the over@@ flying of land by the Boli@@ vian presidential plane , based on the rum@@ our of the presence on his board of Ed@@ ward ? S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de telephone Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent Fab@@ i@@ us conven@@ es America ’ s ambassador , they respond to a real discovery , which is the extent of American surveillance of all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the World Col@@ um@@ ns a few weeks from now on the one hand from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspon@@ dence and , on the other hand , a condemnation of the N@@ SA &apos;s e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ ps by the N@@ SA ?
Is there not a wave of hypocrisy on your part ?
journ@@ alistic action is not a moral position , but a search for the interest and relevance of information that makes it possible for each citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks ve@@ ils the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world , we see this as an important lighting for American power .
When we describe American inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is under no circumstances for us to be indign@@ ant about this practice , it is to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the N@@ SA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The introduction of technological tools of inter@@ c@@ eption that have been very powerful for the last ten years by the United States , but also by France , has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Moreover , in this area , in particular , France and the United States have established procedures for cooperation and almost daily exchange of information , which are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal areas in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sh@@ h was reported to the French by the means of the N@@ SA .
France can be led , for example , to trans@@ mit entire data blocks on the Sa@@ hel region to American services , and in return , as has already been said , the Americans can give information to the French in other parts of the world .
So the fundamental question behind this N@@ SA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to equip themselves with inter@@ c@@ eption tools , that the question of the total absence of prior debate , particularly in the parliaments , on the justification for such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be the@@ irs , and ultimately , the question of whether or not to have a debate . , the issue of violations of freedoms .
What is the real risk to the United States ?
However much they may be denounced , I do not see how they can be punished .
The risk to Americans may be two@@ fold .
The first is when their allies - and this was the case recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes at the top of their state , have been monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have been stra@@ ined .
Another effect may be more econom@@ ical : more and more European or South American businesses are reluctant , in the light of re@@ vel@@ ations , to entr@@ ust their confidential data to American providers subject to US laws , and thus to the capture of the N@@ SA .
My final point is that the broad movement of re@@ vel@@ ations undertaken by media around the world , which helps to initiate a debate on the monitoring practices of so far non-existent intelligence services , could indu@@ ce legislators , including American legislators , to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services .
Pa@@ rents of inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized children can choose “ un@@ defined sex ” .
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third sex for inf@@ ants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
The male or female of the new born will no longer be assigned to birth rigi@@ dly to birth .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare sex their child , allow them to register a “ un@@ specified ” or “ un@@ specified ” sex on his birth certificate .
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could make ha@@ sty decisions about sur@@ ger@@ y of sexual as@@ sign@@ ment for their babies , and to combat discrimination against inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized people .
According to the B@@ BC , an inter@@ sex@@ ually inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ted person would have said years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work of doctors , con@@ tu@@ si@@ fied and bal@@ af@@ é doctors .
It is estimated that one out of 2 000 children born every year is neither a bo@@ y nor a gir@@ l .
They are inter@@ sex@@ ually inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality , inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality forming part of the 60 group of diseases diagno@@ sed as disorder of sex development , a generic term for people with ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es or blo@@ ated ( o@@ v@@ ar or t@@ es@@ co@@ als ) or ab@@ normally developed sexual organs . .
Wallis S@@ imp@@ son could have been inter@@ sex@@ ually inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ised .
S@@ ex@@ ual identification is still not fully understood , but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it is better to use the best available information to award it , then wait and follow the child &apos;s physical and physical development before considering a sur@@ gical act , if necessary .
Dr J@@ ack D@@ res@@ her , a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and speci@@ alist in sexual identification , said that the new German law “ appears to be a good idea . ”
Inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized children pose an ethical dilemma .
&apos;@@ Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases which require sur@@ ger@@ y , but this is not the case for most children &apos; , he added .
It is possible to make sexual as@@ sign@@ ation without operation , and see how identity develops .
The science of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise .
No one can answer the question as to why this happens .
It is like the myster@@ y surrounding homosexual people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described inter-@@ sex persons as different from trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender people , since their status is not sex but rather their biological constitution , which is neither man nor exclusively that of a woman , but is generally both at the same time . Not clearly defined as one or the other .
These characteristics may manifest themselves in the secondary sex character ( such as the mus@@ c@@ le mass , the pil@@ ots , the ch@@ ick@@ ens , and the stat@@ ure ) , the primary sex charac@@ ters ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es and hormones .
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by inter-@@ gender and trans@@ gender people in the field of employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and prejudice motivated by prejudice .
Young boys of the kind that are non-@@ compli@@ ant now have special camps for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .
In June , a 52 year-old Austr@@ ali@@ an , Nor@@ e May@@ -@@ Wel@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been “ neutral ” after he won his appeal trial that allows him to retain a “ un@@ specified ” sex for life .
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ é , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still subject to controversy , according to a report broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of legislators in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for “ gender theory ” to be withdrawn from school books .
The US site Ca@@ the@@ c On@@ line also opposed German law , writing that “ since the world is dra@@ gged into a new rule where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not one , two pillars of civilisation are over@@ turned . ”
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of a baby also said on B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to babies to be awarded to babies .
“ The role of parent is sufficiently stres@@ s@@ ful without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , ” she said on the site for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sexual organs were called her@@ m@@ ph@@ ro@@ d@@ ite , according to the beautiful Greek go@@ d who had a dual sex .
Just about ten years ago , the medical community saw gender as an ar@@ du@@ ous , which can be er@@ ased and on which we can re@@ design .
But now there are many who call into question the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can dec@@ eive themselves , not knowing how a child will feel sexual re@@ as@@ sign@@ ment when it grows .
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , it was called a psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency , ” D@@ res@@ her said .
When these children were born , we did not call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , we call the sur@@ ge@@ on .
The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Mon@@ ey , the University of Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins , who considered gender to be m@@ alle@@ able .
He devoted the term “ sexual identity , ” and argued that social and environmental signals – how parents raise a child – inter@@ act with a child ’ s genes and hormones to design it so that it is identified as male or female .
But in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as “ John / Jo@@ an , ” his the@@ ories have given rise to controversy .
He advised the parents of a small bo@@ y whose pen@@ s had been cut off in a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision of him to have him ca@@ str@@ ated in full , taking him away from the tes@@ ticul@@ ar as well , and raising him as a gir@@ l .
“ Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transition , but it was not , ” D@@ res@@ her said .
At the age of 15 , he became a bo@@ y again and married with a woman .
But , over the course of 38 years , he has committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ her said that some doctors “ always repeat this model . ”
But in the 1990 &apos;s , with the arrival of the Internet , those who survived these sex operations say &apos; they are not satisfied with the result &apos; .
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 3@@ 3@@ -year old writ@@ er from Mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es X@@ Y , but from ambiguous sexual organs .
Do@@ c@@ tors could not really say whether he had a large c@@ lic@@ h@@ é or a small pen@@ s and believed that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
So soon after birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered sur@@ ger@@ y from the external body and tes@@ ticul@@ ar and was raised as a gir@@ l .
He was given female hormones at the age of 12 .
&apos;@@ I knew that I was not a gir@@ l &apos; , he said on A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he en@@ du@@ red a v@@ ag@@ in@@ l@@ as@@ hi@@ a .
But de@@ pressed and realised that something was wrong , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horri@@ fied .
I was ster@@ il@@ ised at birth – and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a mess of sex development ( D@@ S@@ S ) , which prevented his body from producing enough te@@ to@@ ster@@ one for its sexual organs to develop .
Having learned the truth , he has again become a man , following treatment of te@@ to@@ ster@@ one and getting rid of her se@@ ins .
The sur@@ ger@@ y has made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he defends the cause of others in an organisation called Inter@@ face Inter@@ face , which tries to norm@@ alise the perception of inter-@@ sex@@ u@@ alized people .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ pe@@ s , the direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of the non-@@ profit organization that is based in California Ad@@ voc@@ ate for In@@ form@@ ed C@@ ho@@ ice , fears that German law “ inv@@ ites labelling and stig@@ ma@@ tisation . ”
“ Many activists worry that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child a “ indefin@@ ite ” sex , ” he said .
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions .
We think it would be better to at@@ tribute a male or female sex and wait .
But we did not see what the law was going to give , so we can only put forward hypo@@ thes@@ es .
Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ inc@@ is said that his organization supports Austr@@ ali@@ an law because “ it allows adults to choose to be recognised as a third sex . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind , ” she added .
The German law concerns the award of sex to birth .
This is not a battle for young children to take to that age .
When they grow up , they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr Ar@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , a radi@@ olog@@ ist speci@@ alized in ma@@ m@@ mo@@ graph@@ s in Pit@@ t@@ s@@ burgh , whose daughter is affected by a sexual development mess , and which helps thousands of people in a support group , said that German law “ will take responsibility ” for parents and for them . children .
The daughter of Dr Bar@@ at@@ z , K@@ diplomacy , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es , but is suffering from a D@@ D@@ S known as full in@@ sensitivity to an@@ dro@@ gen .
As a result of the failure of his an@@ dro@@ gen rec@@ ep@@ tors , K@@ diplomacy developed women ’ s characteristics .
It has a v@@ ag@@ in , but it does not have a ro@@ v@@ age or o@@ v@@ ar .
Today , 29 years old , K@@ diplomacy is married and internal to inf@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at the University of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
Although it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or be@@ ating mothers .
&apos;@@ The law gives parents a certain la@@ titude so that they do not have to make ha@@ sty decisions &apos; , said Bar@@ at@@ z .
This gives them time to carry out certain tests and to understand them , and a deadline before they include &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female &apos; .
So , all goes well – you can bring up your child and love it .
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parent .
You do not have to rush into a sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
“ This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitig@@ ates the sense of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need , ” he said .
Finally , the child will decide with which sex he or she feels the most comfortable , and that is something wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .
Le@@ t@@ tered in government ’ s long@@ ev@@ ity
Italian Council President En@@ ric@@ o L@@ et@@ ta believes that his government will hold until 2015 , despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition , with the Senate vote to remove Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi from his mandate .
In an interview with La Sta@@ mp@@ a in the daily newspaper La Sta@@ mp@@ a , he said that he was firmly committed to continuing to govern with his coalition until the next general election in 2015 .
The Italian Parliament &apos;s upper house will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate , where he has more opponents than supporters , pronoun@@ ces his dismis@@ sal .
But part of his camp , grou@@ ped together around the National Secretary of People ’ s Freedom ( P@@ D@@ L ) Ang@@ el@@ ino Al@@ f@@ ano , continues to support the government , as was demonstrated on 2 October last year by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi ’ s orders for already dro@@ pping the cabinet .
L@@ .@@ A@@ . Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Agency , T@@ SA , and a suspect have been injured during the exchange of fire .
There have been fire@@ fighters who have said that they have responded to a call for &apos; multiple injured &apos; .
&apos;@@ The forces of law and order are there , the airport is on its T@@ wit@@ ter account , while television pictures showed people evac@@ uated in am@@ bul@@ ances .
&apos;@@ There was a sho@@ oting &apos; , told the A@@ F@@ P a spokesman for the US Transport Security Agency ( T@@ SA ) .
A@@ BC ’ s local an@@ ten@@ na showed a person evac@@ uated on a bu@@ ck , and a second transported on a whe@@ el@@ chair .
The incident took place at 9.@@ 30 local levels ( 12.@@ 30 p.m. in Mon@@ tre@@ al ) at the airport &apos;s 3 ter@@ minal 3 , and specified the airport as well .
The L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Times states that the 2 and 3 t@@ ours are being evac@@ uated .
The spokesman for the T@@ SA was unable to confirm in the immediate future whether one of his employees was injured .
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended .
The Israeli army k@@ ills a member of Hamas in Gaz@@ a-@@ s@@ these
On Thursday , Israeli tanks killed an Islamist milit@@ ant Hamas milit@@ ant from Hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip , from sources of health services .
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting has broken out in that region , because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mor@@ als .
The Israeli army simply referred to &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a tunnel described as &apos; terrorist &apos; by the Israeli state , which was wi@@ ped out at the border and whose discovery was announced mid-@@ October .
Report : Obama ’ s campaign as B@@ id@@ en fell for H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton .
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have planned , in the greatest secrecy , to replace Vice-President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en with H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most significant event that appears in the expectation of Mar@@ k Hal@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ mann , the 2012 “ D@@ ow@@ n D@@ ow@@ n , ” “ D@@ ow@@ n 2012 . ”
The Times received a copy of the book to appear , and on Thursday evening told that the president ’ s close collabor@@ ators had carried out “ in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see whether B@@ id@@ en ’ s ou@@ ster could help Obama to re-@@ election when his hopes d@@ wind@@ led .
According to the political correspon@@ dent of Times J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin , the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the campaign ’ s top leaders and the White House , the former Secretary General of the White House Bill D@@ e@@ al@@ y , aimed at measuring the effect of the former Secretary of State ’ s replacement by former Secretary of State Clinton . Perhaps we could have a vote on the ballot .
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been fier@@ cely kept within the Chic@@ ago campaign of Chic@@ ago and within the O@@ val Office .
Only half a dozen close coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors – notably D@@ e@@ al@@ y , Obama ’ s former chief campaign leader J@@ im Mess@@ ina and former coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors in the White House David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e – knew that change was under consideration .
D@@ ow@@ n indicated that D@@ ow@@ n led the charge to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite “ close personal links , ” before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that Clinton on the presidential list was “ not improving Obama ’ s chances of success . ”
In an interview with Martin , D@@ e@@ al@@ y confirmed that the administration effectively envisaged the replacement of B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
“ I said that I had looked at a whole series of questions , and that was one of them ’ , said D@@ e@@ al@@ y to the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that at that time the President was not in shape , so we were told , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos; .
While D@@ e@@ al@@ y called “ concer@@ t , ” Martin Co@@ op@@ er told C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested a great deal of effort to find out whether change would be beneficial in the ballot box .
&apos;@@ The countryside does not spend much money on the polls and on discussion groups unless they are serious about taking measures &apos; , according to Martin on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
However , we do not know whether Obama was aware that his team was considering replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N that he asked D@@ e@@ al@@ y if his bos@@ s knew about the possible res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le .
Although D@@ e@@ al@@ y said that he did not think the President “ knew ” about possible change , the former Secretary General admitted that he was “ possible ” that Obama knew .
Martin added that “ D@@ ow@@ n ’ s ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question as to whether political opinion polls had reached Obama ’ s office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know that B@@ id@@ en ’ s ou@@ ster from the presidential list was being considered .
‘ Perhaps ’ , he replied .
Do you want to see a flu@@ o ice ?
A British business@@ man created the first flu@@ or@@ res@@ c@@ ent ice in the world .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has benefited from the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of this marine animal to develop a lu@@ min@@ es@@ cent col@@ lation .
He had the idea after reading a study of the m@@ ou@@ ths and convinced Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate the brilliant protein .
The gl@@ ac@@ ious cre@@ am re@@ acts with language by increasing the protein p@@ H to make it sh@@ ine .
Ch@@ ris explains that , since the cre@@ am cre@@ am is beginning to read when she re@@ acts to the heat of the mouth , the more you leave , the more brilliant it becomes .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the g@@ ic@@ k society ‘ L@@ ick M@@ e D@@ li@@ ic@@ us ’ , said : ‘ It is an incredible thing , but we are still in the early stages of production , and 2 g of that cost costs about £ 200 ’ .
The protein we use in ice re@@ acts with the neutral p@@ H language .
So when your mouth is heating up the protein , the p@@ H level is rising , and ice is sh@@ ining .
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the moment of H@@ al@@ we@@ en because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice I created because the f@@ ence of the m@@ ou@@ ths is four times more expensive than gold .
So I cost about £ 140 in every boom .
But it has a rather good taste !
Society with the experimental approach of Char@@ lie , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual ice per@@ f@@ umes such as beer , che@@ ese , beef and the gold lea@@ f .
But its next creation is becoming even more ambitious .
He added : ‘ I would really like to develop an in@@ visible ice ’ .
It is intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ation caused by ic@@ y cr@@ acks that are the cre@@ am cre@@ am , but I think I will find a way to do that .
The ice uses the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent properties of the m@@ ou@@ th@@ ic nature of Chinese scientists .
L@@ ou re@@ ed was dead during a tac@@ it session .

The arti@@ st died last Sunday at the age of 71 .
&apos;@@ He died on Sunday morning when he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st movement &apos; , with his mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an hands who b@@ led the air , writ@@ es La@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son .

H@@ lo@@ we@@ ed 2013 : In figures
When I was small , H@@ lo@@ we@@ en was magic .
My s@@ ister and I were allowed to eat swee@@ ts , go late and d@@ ress to the neighbourhood .
Today , I have become more ing@@ ra@@ ined .
Over the past two years , I have not distributed a single good and I will certainly not do so this year .
But tra@@ ine@@ es show that I am the black sheep when we speak of H@@ lo@@ we@@ en .
The majority of Americans – 15@@ 8 million of them in fact – will celebrate H@@ lo@@ we@@ en this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 trillion in swee@@ ts , disgu@@ ise and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to the National R@@ et@@ ail F@@ eder@@ ation .
What I look forward to at every H@@ lo@@ we@@ en party is the trends .
The disgu@@ ise should represent $ 1.2 of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , in@@ anim@@ ated ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ate objects are fur@@ y .
Women no longer need to be sex@@ y professionals ; they can also be sex@@ y foods like p@@ iz@@ z@@ as , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As far as men are concerned , I expect to see many z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , thanks to the television series of The Wal@@ king De@@ ad , and I am be@@ tting that the men of the D@@ a@@ soft P@@ und@@ k area will be among our photo@@ graph@@ s of In@@ st@@ gra@@ m this year .
According to Google , the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after disgu@@ ise is the z@@ om@@ bi@@ e , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my aston@@ ishment , they were not alone .
In fact , the US is going to spend $ 3@@ 30 M on animals this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
It makes many strange dogs disgu@@ ised as ho@@ ot@@ es .
When it is a question of swee@@ ten@@ ers , we do not sle@@ ep .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 on swee@@ ten@@ ers this year , according to Ni@@ el@@ sen ’ s cabinet .
This represents around 27@@ 2 million b@@ ars of Her@@ sh@@ y , sugar , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ l@@ ers and C@@ lar@@ k C@@ lar@@ k .
This is a great deal for the 41 million children who go to hun@@ t for swee@@ ts in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Comm@@ er@@ ce .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not tell ourselves , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate during H@@ al@@ we@@ en .
cor@@ n b@@ ones are the only thing we do not want to eat , yet almost 16 million k@@ g are sold for H@@ al@@ we@@ en , according to the National Con@@ f@@ lic@@ tion Association .
That means around 9 billion cor@@ n gra@@ ins .
This is a myster@@ y that I have not yet managed to clarify .
Nothing is more representative of H@@ lo@@ we@@ en than H@@ lo@@ we@@ en .
They carry the best names , such as &apos; Ter@@ ro@@ r Be@@ in@@ d the Wall@@ s &apos; , &apos; H@@ ow@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ S@@ c@@ re@@ am &apos; and &apos; The House of Sh@@ ce@@ k &apos; .
In fact , there are 1 200 houses that have been officially recognised in the United States , which generates around 500 or so recei@@ p@@ ts of revenue , according to the Americ@@ as , and that includes the wonderful photo@@ graph@@ s of you with you that your friends put on Fac@@ e@@ book and that you cannot take away from them . On which you like a kind of style style style .
Finally , let us talk about cement .
Char@@ lie Brown presented to us La G@@ ro@@ se Ci@@ ro@@ ille when you were a gam@@ ble , and s@@ cul@@ p@@ ting a mo@@ ver in the form of mo@@ therhood , that is , like dec@@ or@@ ating a Christmas tre@@ e – something that we have been doing since we were all small .
Fortunately for us , the &apos; baby ci@@ f@@ ill@@ es trend &apos; began only last year thanks to P@@ inter@@ is , so most of us have s@@ cul@@ led these po@@ ti@@ les and have not had to sit in .
This year , Americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 M in cement , according to U@@ .@@ S@@ . C@@ en@@ sus Bureau .
The tow@@ ers that are slowly wa@@ king up on your house were probably from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 5@@ 42 million cement nets were grown this year .
If you try to make you more notic@@ eable , call Ti@@ m and S@@ us@@ an M@@ ath@@ is@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , California , and try to s@@ cra@@ p their c@@ ill@@ es from 9@@ 22 k@@ g .

The fire bri@@ g@@ ade was called upon to rescue a ha@@ ot lost after being stuck at 15 m above the soil on an unstable cor@@ ni@@ val in a career .
Ru@@ by , a be@@ ac@@ on co@@ ker , escap@@ ed after a serious accident on the road .
It was picked up three days later by a person who promoted his dog in his career .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade des@@ cen@@ ded on the c@@ lif@@ f to recover the Chil@@ ean chi@@ p and save it from a certain death .
A chi@@ ot had the chance to get out of the worst after the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was asked to recover him safely when he was lost at 15 m above the soil on the unstable season of a c@@ lif@@ f .
Ru@@ by , a 9 months co@@ ker , escap@@ ed after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived only three days before he was saved in a career on Wednesday .
His owners , Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years , and his small friend Bec@@ ke@@ y H@@ all , 20 years ago went to the career of F@@ l@@ res@@ pite in D@@ ren@@ ol@@ me , in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to re@@ discover Ru@@ by and thank the rescue and rescue service . W@@ est Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
They had been desperately searching for their lost chi@@ efs and launched a call on social net@@ working sites after they disappeared into the career as a result of an un@@ severity accident .
T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ .@@ 15 Wednesday , a person with an acute view who promoted his dog re@@ ne@@ ged up Ru@@ by on a career cor@@ nic@@ he , 15 m above the soil .
A technical rescue team from the C@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fire r@@ ank p@@ oured into the scene and took on as a reminder to save Ru@@ by by using an animal civic to transport it up to the c@@ lif@@ f of the c@@ lif@@ f .
An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton ’ s technical expert , An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton , said : “ It was in a precarious situation . ”
She was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , at 15 m of the summit and 15 of the soil .
It did not move at all during the rescue – it was frozen .
But it is going well now .
She e@@ aten b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
It was a very unusual appeal .
It is un@@ believ@@ able that someone noticed the dog .
The technical rescue expert Peter L@@ u said : &apos; Ru@@ by was very fortunate to get out of it un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed &apos; .
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was led by the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for control ; his general state was satisfactory , apart from exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
M@@ iss H@@ all , from H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ I was terri@@ fied by observing the rescue . ”
First of all , I did not believe that she was there .
It was surprising to have him in his arms again .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian said that if she had been too exhausted and van@@ ished , she would probably have fallen .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade has been wrec@@ king .
What they did was really courageous .
We are so grateful to them , all of them have been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ ei@@ gh@@ ley , added : ‘ One was afraid that it fell , but it did not move . ’
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade has been sup@@ pressed .
I cannot believe that she was there .

According to the Chinese police , three U@@ igh@@ urs of a single family from the Islamic region of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , a border region of several Central Asian countries , have preci@@ pit@@ ated their g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine cars against the entry of the C@@ it@@ é banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that claimed two deaths and caused two deaths . 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and her mother died in the fire of the car .
E@@ ti@@ m , which declared itself to be fighting for the independence of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan , a former Chinese X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang name , was classified by the UN in 2002 as organisations aff@@ ili@@ ated with al-@@ Qaeda .
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic disorders in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is being questioned by several experts .
George K@@ er@@ evo : The S@@ co@@ t of Europe gives the S@@ co@@ ts a choice .
Another day , another worrying history of independence .
This time , we were told that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to be able to join the EU .
Now we hear stories of passport control at Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wi@@ re border along the H@@ ad@@ nothing wall .
While it is true that Stra@@ th@@ y@@ de ’ s newspaper indicated the possible economic effects of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it was not in the headlines ( and that was forecast ) .
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance with the rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from S@@ co@@ ts .
It is therefore a story that is not one of them .
And a history so old that it is now fixed : I heard for the first time that &apos; independence means passport control &apos; more than 40 years ago .
However , there has been an interesting point in this interpretation of an old d@@ ust .
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe &apos;s instructions , in fact ?
Why exchange London &apos;s y@@ o@@ ke against that of Brussels , especially now ?
This is the real topical issue in Europe : the great post@@ war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is completely at a standstill .
With the euro crisis , the Europe Pro@@ ject is officially dead .
Ac@@ ross Europe , parties that oppose the EU or who are fighting for the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Al@@ ter@@ native for Germany , based solely this year and arrived at nowhere , brought almost five million votes together in the September federal elections and lifted the Liberal Democratic Party ( equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the B@@ unde@@ sta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , together with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket of national economies through membership of the single currency , has led many people to think that Europe has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that run excessive budget deficits – that was true only for Greece .
Instead , the European system has put its members in favour of German exporters – which German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , southern European countries end up with an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany .
The only recourse is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper un@@ ease with productivity in Europe .
Following the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidi@@ zing French and German energy companies at the consumer ’ s expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US .
This is a draw@@ back in terms of costs , as we have already seen in G@@ ran@@ na@@ ut .
All wage ear@@ ners in the world will not prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being penalised by cheap American sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the revol@@ t , particularly in France , is one of the EU &apos;s great leaders .
After the war , the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy damaged .
As a result , Mar@@ ine Le Pen ’ s far-@@ right National Front , the anti-@@ European National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , sending the Socialists to power in third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically promote the left .
What does Mari@@ e Le Pen do with his new popularity among the French white working class ?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-@@ European and anti-@@ European bloc in the European Parliament .
If the anti-@@ European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , the anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will return to something that will look more like &apos; the Europe of Nations ( sovereign ) &apos; favoured by General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro , but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency .
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project , and I hope it will be a soft one in the United States .
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could live with a fre@@ er European agreement , provided that we keep our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe .
Otherwise , we should em@@ ul@@ ate Norway and retain our economic independence .
S@@ N@@ P ’ s S@@ N@@ P government is – and this is worth noting – the most successful anti-@@ austerity political movement in Europe , as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed cuts ( and implemented ) by the Labour Chancellor , Al@@ lis@@ ir Dar@@ ling . and the conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
E@@ arly P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty : A@@ ge@@ ing earlier
Stu@@ dies show that Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the pun@@ ch age earlier than white girls .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ cal Change does not mean that the pu@@ ber@@ ty is imminent .
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for this .
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early pub@@ er@@ ty .
The trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is not so pronounced among boys .
The old C@@ N@@ N correspon@@ dent P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a specialist journalist in family and child health issues .
Should a mother be worried if her daughter ’ s se@@ ins and pe@@ as@@ ants are starting to grow to 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ ar@@ ics this week in Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Dr Paul K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist , explained that early physical changes are fairly common among young people . American and a new standard .
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general it does not indicate a rapid evolution to full pub@@ er@@ ty ’ , K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z said .
There are clear signs of development , such as the bur@@ ge@@ oning of se@@ ins , the po@@ les under the arms and the pun@@ ch zone and body sm@@ ell .
But there was only a small advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , while it was 12 quarters of three quarters in 1970 .
“ Once the ch@@ est began to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear , ” K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of E@@ ar@@ ly P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ ls : The Es@@ s@@ ential Gu@@ ide to C@@ ing with Th@@ is . &quot; Pro@@ s@@ per@@ m &quot; .
Time is the most precise test of how pub@@ er@@ ty is going to change .
There is a debate about what constitutes the real outbreak , but it is considered to be &apos; early &apos; when the development of the ch@@ est is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows or stops – something that a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can follow closely .
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ists to remove serious problems such as tu@@ m@@ ours or k@@ y@@ sts .
There are treatments for delaying the appearance of the first rules and preventing further consequences : premature ageing of the b@@ ones that can curb growth and a small size in ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
The recommendations for medicinal and hormon@@ al treatment are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
The psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ ap@@ ow@@ it@@ z is prudent with drugs , but recognizes that “ control of pu@@ ber@@ ty can reduce behavior and sen@@ s@@ ation for young girls to be different from others . ”
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
&apos;@@ They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they are going to deal with hygiene issues &apos; , said K@@ at@@ l@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
“ It was a shock , ” re@@ minis@@ cent of a woman whose daughter had its first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
She returned from the sc@@ ary and shocked school of being the first one of her friends .
There are many the@@ ories of public knowledge about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
However , there is no coherent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods , chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages from the media are responsible .
boys , like girls , reach their pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
K@@ ap@@ ow@@ it@@ z claims that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He took part in a study of girls aged between 6 and 9 , which links the percentage of fat mass to the outbreak of pu@@ ber@@ ty .
Other disco@@ veries support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the age of pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
At global level , the mechanisms of early pub@@ er@@ ty seem to be influenced by everything , from economic conditions to the genes .
Another problem is the fact that the boys have po@@ ison on their face and in the younger pu@@ b area , the trend towards genuine early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced as among girls .
Other doctors at the A@@ A@@ P conference insisted on the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ac@@ it@@ é and the po@@ goods are common@@ place , even in inf@@ ants and small ones .
“ We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of pu@@ ber@@ ty , ” Dr L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man said , a child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist working at the children ’ s children ’ s hospital Gor@@ y@@ e@@ b in Mor@@ ris@@ t@@ down in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents should not hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ s to know how to speak with their children .
“ This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than planned , ” K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z explained .
If you remain calm , your child will respond well in general .
G@@ ir@@ ls with early pu@@ ber@@ ing must be reassured that , even when it happens earlier than anticipated , the process is part of life .

The F@@ air@@ ers argue about the wid@@ th of seats , while large orders are at stake .
The dispute is ra@@ ging between the large aircraft manufacturers over the wid@@ th of tourist class seats on long-@@ ha@@ ul flights , pa@@ ving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical sal@@ ion , which takes place in the month .
The conflict relates to the wid@@ th of proposed seats on long-@@ distance passenger flights – not always the most cour@@ ted by airlines , but to which the allocated space is essential for increasing efficiency gains in the last appli@@ ances presented by Airbus and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week Airbus has called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 h@@ ens ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Bo@@ eing says that it should be up to the airlines to decide .
The dispute has broken out when avi@@ on@@ ers seek to sell even larger versions of their mil@@ der planes , possibly hoping for a record@@ -@@ high order when the event takes place from 17 to 21 November .
The way in which seats will be ready at the back of the plane – in particular , there will be 9 or 10 fron@@ t-@@ seat seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-@@ ju@@ bil@@ br@@ o seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says that its “ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X ” re@@ organization can receive 40@@ 6 people in seats of more than 17 large h@@ ens , and will be confi@@ gu@@ red with 10 seats per r@@ ank .
Airbus points out that the rival version of its A@@ 350 will carry 350 people in economic class 350 people in 18 h@@ ens in the middle of the 9 h@@ ens .
The aircraft gi@@ ants often exchange cou@@ ps on technical issues by advertising in the professional press .
Now Airbus is directly appealing to the public before the Dub@@ ai Air@@ line , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
Recently , we saw what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financi@@ ers of a photo@@ grap@@ h showing three people in restaur@@ ants , entitled “ Will you accept that ? ”
&quot; Bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ distance flights in smaller seats than in regional tur@@ bo@@ pro@@ pe@@ ers , &quot; John Le@@ a@@ h@@ y , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people grow , but the seats in aircraft have not radically changed .
Between the early 1970 ’ s when Bo@@ eing ’ s ju@@ m@@ o 7@@ 47 defined modern long-@@ ha@@ ul travel , and the turn of the century , the average American ’ s weight of 4@@ 0-@@ 49 years increased by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 h@@ ens , according to US health statistics .
Airbus dec@@ la@@ res that its ri@@ vals are cl@@ inging to a concept of sie@@ ge which dates back to the 195@@ 0s , when the circum@@ ven@@ ting of the new@@ ly-@@ called &apos; j@@ et j@@ et &apos; cir@@ cu@@ it was narrow@@ er .
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study indicating that one extra chic@@ ken in the wid@@ th of seats would improve the quality of sle@@ ep by 53 % .
Bo@@ eing is dispu@@ ting the figures for Airbus as regards the wid@@ th of the seats and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance ticket and equipment prices .
He also says that the study shows that the cab@@ in experience does not depend only on the wid@@ th of seats .
&apos;@@ It really is a question of giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , has said K@@ ent C@@ rav@@ er in charge of Bo@@ eing &apos;s satisfaction .
They do not want to be told what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more a question of having a certain freedom of movement , but for suppliers this is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders for an estimated $ 700 of at least $ 700 at the price of the market in the coming decades to shift the balance of US and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters pointed out for the first time in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what is fu@@ eling the battle between the last appli@@ ances .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing both claim a seat yield per seat in their latest models of long-@@ distance ste@@ ers 20 % higher than that of the market leader in this seg@@ ment , the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ ER@@ ER by 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing depends , in part , on the comparison between the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation with 10 seats per r@@ ank and a 7@@ 77 work@@ -@@ home model of 9 .
The advantage in terms of unit costs is low compared to the apparatus with 10 seats at the moment in service .
‘ Bo@@ eing does it to be able to c@@ up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products ’ , has declared K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ is@@ on , Director of Con@@ te@@ st@@ er to the European Airbus .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say that the j@@ uni@@ or cab@@ ins with 10 seats per row in the 7@@ 77 seats suggest that many passengers vote for a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs .
&quot; A wid@@ th for 18 h@@ ens would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 &apos; , declared the expert at M@@ ary Kir@@ by , the foun@@ der and chief ed@@ itor of R@@ é@@ n@@ é@@ e , M@@ ary Kir@@ by . &apos;@@ G@@ ir@@ l Network Network &apos; .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers to which the airlines must choose .
The aircraft sel@@ lers who turn around the world even one me@@ tre to check the competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While all manufacturers are selling comfortable devices , all manufacturers also offer aeroplan@@ es with high-@@ den@@ sity confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations to low-cost airlines and regional travel companies .
Airbus provides an A@@ 350 with 10 seats per r@@ ank but it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus pointed out the need for greater person@@ alization of cab@@ ins by offering larger seats to some of its aircraft .
Without support from the only major manufacturer of modern modern appli@@ ances , experts say that it is unlikely that his appeal to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats will succeed , but that he could forget the wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X sales .
The shareholders of O@@ rac@@ es ir@@ ated by El@@ ison ’ s salary
A majority of shareholders in O@@ rac@@ es voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the foun@@ der and Director-General Lar@@ ry E@@ l@@ ison , given the financial performance of his group .
The vote is not binding , but tar@@ n@@ ishes the image of Lar@@ ry E@@ l@@ ison , the third largest wealth of the world with the victory of her ship at the American Cup .

His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar .
O@@ ut of the total 2013 financial year , the net benefits of O@@ rac@@ es rose by 3.5 % , while stock prices at 27@@ .5 % , over@@ performing the S &amp; P 500 index , took 24 % at the same time .

The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus selec@@ tively infec@@ ts li@@ ver cells , which then begin to produce a regular stream of anti@@ bodies .
Anti@@ bodies are tr@@ acking down all m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules of nic@@ ot@@ ine in the blood system and neutr@@ alising them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having his do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
In the tests , the vacc@@ inated m@@ ice to which you then gave nic@@ ot@@ ine continued their business .
But the m@@ ice that had not been vacc@@ inated “ were aff@@ lu@@ ent , ” told researchers that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
The experience is described in the jour@@ nal Science Trans@@ la@@ in Medic@@ ine .
Pre@@ vious tobacco vaccines have proved ineffective because they contain anti@@ bodies .
In@@ jec@@ tions had to be repeated so frequently for anti@@ bodies to remain high than they were too expensive and in@@ convenient .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe , it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nic@@ ot@@ ine .
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
&quot; They will know that if they start smoking again , because of the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and it will help them to lose their bad habit &apos; , he added .
British scientists have said that the results are interesting , but have pointed out that much more research is needed .
Pakistan ’ s Lead@@ er of the Taliban
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south , was killed in an American dr@@ one on Friday in Pakistan , he was told about the security services .
H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south has already been announced several times in the past .
But intelligence officials , army , and activis@@ t officials have said that he has lost his life in this strike , conducted in the North W@@ az@@ ir@@ istan region .
&apos;@@ We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south was killed in a dr@@ one launch &apos; , said a senior security officer .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister N@@ awa@@ z Shar@@ if , travelling to London , informed the British Government that discussions had been initiated with Te@@ h@@ ri@@ k e Pakistan ( T@@ T@@ P ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies O@@ be@@ id
Former Labour Minister in New Year , Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di , will be subject to an investigation of the state ’ s anti-@@ corruption regulator .
Former New Wales Minister Jo@@ e Tri@@ pol@@ di denied that he had changed the trade policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three assets in the govern@@ ment-@@ controlled area .
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Cor@@ ruption ( I@@ CA@@ C ) broad@@ ened its investigation to know whether Mr O@@ be@@ id had put pressure on several state ministers to renew his b@@ its in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar four , where the O@@ be@@ id had two restaur@@ ants and one coffee after it had been . Their expiry in August 2005 without any call for ten@@ ders .
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di was aware of the secret interest of Mr O@@ be@@ d@@ id in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of former Secretary-General of Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ po@@ le , on Thursday .
In the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government pressed for ten@@ ders to be put out to tender .
The ten@@ ants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , the “ C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four ” companies , which reported to the O@@ be@@ d about $ 2.5 per year , were renewed without any call for ten@@ ders .
Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , who was Minister for Por@@ ts from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of ten@@ ders .
But he denied that he changed his policy at the request of Mr O@@ be@@ d@@ id , who acknowledged Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , called for a change in government policy on b@@ ones .
The IC@@ CA@@ C &apos;s trans@@ cri@@ ption of telephone convers@@ ations demonstrated in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who came to the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of Mr O@@ be@@ id to the Ministry of Fisheries . .
“ The subject discussed during these telephone convers@@ ations was the development of policy on trade policy ? ” asked the Commissioner , An@@ th@@ ony Wa@@ al@@ y , to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
No &apos; No &apos; , Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di replied .
I do not remember what we discussed , but in any case it was not .
In any case , certainly not between me and Mr O@@ be@@ d .
Israeli war@@ planes target Syria , dec@@ la@@ res a person to be responsible for it .
Israeli war@@ planes have reached a target in Syria ’ s port city of La@@ k@@ ia on Thursday evening , confirming a military official in Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said that there were at least one .
The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress reports that the target was SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 Russian manufacturing missiles .

Foreign workers who have a visa 4@@ 57 may have to pass a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test .
The government is currently examining the possibility of establishing a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test for foreign workers in possession of 4@@ 57 visas when it plans to extend repressive measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent visas 4@@ 57 being used to occupy un@@ skilled jobs or as a back door to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A government working document was un@@ ve@@ iled today , when Labour MEP Ma@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w denounced the government dis@@ course on foreign workers , saying that it could off@@ end Australia ’ s neighbors .
“ The f@@ rac@@ king statements about “ foreigners returning to the qu@@ e@@ ue and “ jobs for the Austr@@ ali@@ ans first ” are a dis@@ agre@@ eable return to the era when trade unions asked for a protected labour market , ” she told the Austr@@ ali@@ a Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , this meant that wh@@ ites ’ work had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region would see this as an echo of this historical ar@@ te@@ play .
The working document reports the 12 measures previously envisaged by former immigration minister Ch@@ ris Bow@@ en .
Im@@ migrants B@@ ren@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being under examination .
If the &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; criterion was adopted , a visa applicant could be controlled as to whether the offer of employment is genuine in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or the person concerned in the company which spons@@ ors it . &apos;
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be required to declare the number of holders of visas 4@@ 57 after some of them , having intended to spons@@ or a small number of workers , actually used hundreds .
Meanwhile , a Sri Lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker , 35 years old , would have died from heart attacks after arriving on a boat transporting asylum seekers to the island of Chris@@ t@@ mas this week .
The 9 year-old s@@ son of man was going to Australia with him and has found comfort since his father died on Wednesday with an adult c@@ ous@@ in that was also on board .
M@@ an was urgently transferred by the Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities to the hospital on Is@@ land Chris@@ t@@ mas , where he died .
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work carried out by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of P@@ as@@ se 1 in 20@@ 26 .
The Transport Minister K@@ ram@@ er said that the plan &apos; would bring together the United Kingdom &apos; .
The Scottish Minister for Transport , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown , said that he was exc@@ ited about working with the British Government on the project .
P@@ as@@ se 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When P@@ ha@@ se 2 is completed , the lines will serve Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building high-speed links between London and North England from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7 M@@ d to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ d .
The British Government , which talks with S@@ co@@ t@@ land , has asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of travel for northern England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travelling times between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh from three hours to the most .
K@@ ram@@ er said : &apos; Our objective for H@@ S@@ 2 relates to a truly national network which will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together &apos; .
We are pushing the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the advantages it presents are enormous .
Without it , we have a problem with the capacity of our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connec@@ tivity between the 18 large British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that the links between them can be better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ is@@ ta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &apos;
For the Scottish Government , K@@ e@@ ith Brown has called on Car@@ mi@@ ha@@ el to support Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &apos; The high-speed train has the potential to offer Scotland considerable economic benefits , but it also brings Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Britain .
“ We are therefore exc@@ ited about working in partnership with the British Government to look at options to get the high-speed train network up to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and comple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
&apos;@@ I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then deciding on the next steps together . &apos;
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force for the time being in Australia .
Austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers will have to continue to switch off their t@@ ab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones during take@@ -@@ off and landing despite the US gesture to rela@@ x regulation of electronic appli@@ ances .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for American ha@@ uli@@ ers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch video or play games on their appli@@ ances during critical flight periods provided they are in &quot; aeroplan@@ es . &quot;
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do so for most of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Austr@@ ali@@ an carriers are examining the decision which obliges American carriers to carry out important work in order to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Aviation Authority , too , stated that it was examining the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic appli@@ ances during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia .
&apos;@@ CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic appli@@ ances &apos; , she said .
The issue is the subject of regulation which obliges aircraft operators to guarantee permanent safety and passengers to respect safety instructions provided by crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , who has already spoken in the CA@@ SA of its intention to extend the use of its enter@@ tainment system on board the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology , was open to change , but said that it would follow the regulator .
&apos;@@ We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA which would allow electronic appli@@ ances to be used because we really believe that this would improve the experience that we have now ( from the so-called enter@@ tainment system using the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology ) on our aeroplan@@ es , has indicated a spokes@@ person .
Q@@ an@@ it@@ as said that at the moment it is respecting the current rules .
&apos;@@ In line with our current policy , electronic appli@@ ances cannot be used during take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we have no immediate intention of changing that &apos; , she said .
The FA@@ A &apos;s decision applies to US airlines .
However , we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For American carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
Air@@ lines will have to demonstrate that their aeroplan@@ es can tolerate radio interference from electronic appli@@ ances , as well as reviewing the tex@@ t@@ books , training equipment , hand lu@@ gg@@ age programme and the instructions provided to passengers .
‘ As soon as an airline has checked its fleet ’ s tolerance , it can allow passengers to use light electronic devices such as t@@ ab@@ lets , electronic lec@@ tu@@ rers and smar@@ t@@ phones to all al@@ titude ’ declared the FA@@ A .
In the few cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to switch off their appli@@ ances during landing .
The group also recommended that the heavi@@ er appli@@ ances be safely placed under the chair@@ s or in the higher compar@@ tments during take@@ -@@ off and landing .

The C@@ l@@ enders of Singapore benefit from the middle classes , which are forced to tighten their bel@@ ts .
In a len@@ der of the B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er Comm@@ er@@ ce Centre in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani A@@ mir@@ th@@ ing@@ ing@@ a de@@ poses a po@@ t , a jo@@ ke , and a gold ta@@ p to pay for his d@@ augh@@ ters ’ scho@@ oling .
&apos;@@ My hus@@ band and I have just bought a house , so my money is there &apos; , says Mrs A@@ mir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
Although it ear@@ ns $ 3 000 from Singapore ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) per month as a female determin@@ ant , and its hus@@ band also works , monthly family income is not , it says , sufficient .
In fact , there is such demand in parts of Sou@@ theast Asia – where household debt is rising – that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , where she carried out her transaction , became the third loan company to be introduced at the Singapore stock exchange this week .
P@@ utting together je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a quick way to get cash – $ 1@@ ,@@ 300 in Singapore in the case of Ms A@@ mir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but it is almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank lending .
In general , l@@ enders at Singapore raise an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by the United O@@ ver@@ se@@ as Bank , a local donor with a branch in the same commercial center .
L@@ enders , however , have the advantage of not asking for cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or wage evidence , and they can release loans more quickly than banks .
As a result , millions of people throughout the region are turning to l@@ enders on the brink , while families feel the pressure exerted by increasing the cost of living and over-@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fueled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies , low-@@ income and middle-@@ income families are turning to l@@ enders to fill the difference while their economies are slowing .
This week , the credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora cited growing household indeb@@ tedness , mainly deri@@ ving from rising mortgage lending , as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt / gross domestic product in Asia .
Malaysia is leading the list with 80 % of GDP , while the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists also fear high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which soon emerged from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data has shown continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
“ The balance sheet is that , with costs rising , people in the middle or at the bottom seek to supplement their income as they can , ” S@@ ong Sen@@ en@@ g W@@ u@@ n , an economist at IC@@ M@@ B , dec@@ la@@ res a Malay@@ sian bank .
His@@ tor@@ ically high gold prices over the last two years have meant that people have been quick to put their personal effects on the cash value of their je@@ wel@@ ry .
In Singapore , around 70 % of the articles in the 200 loan shops on the state are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us bring the gold chain to grand@@ mother and we will return it next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest loan operator , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , has recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the lending sector that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , operator in B@@ end@@ em@@ em@@ er and 15 other shops like in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia , says Y@@ e@@ men@@ i . ah Le@@ e Ch@@ ing , his direc@@ tor@@ at@@ es-@@ general .
Society will finance them by using 60 % of Singapore ’ s 66 M M removed this week during its introduction to the Singapore stock exchange .
While some low-@@ interest l@@ enders have been critical of the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates that they practice , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah indicates that enforcement offers not only lower rates than other l@@ enders , but also does not directly increase debt .
“ customers are mortg@@ aging the goods they already possess , and mone@@ tiz@@ ing their personal assets does not increase household indeb@@ tedness ” , she says .
D@@ em@@ on@@ str@@ ation is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term .
Those who travel to the l@@ enders are not just those who have financial problems .
The aff@@ lu@@ ent people of Singapore also go to V@@ alum@@ u@@ x lending shops to put in gold le@@ ing@@ ings or Ro@@ le@@ x mon@@ sters , which can account for up to 60 % of their cash purchase price .
We see clients in all str@@ ata of society .
&apos;@@ It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investment , or small businesses with cash needs to go through a difficult course &apos; , adding M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes they need money very quickly .

A $ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue plan for T@@ as@@ man@@ ia ’ s health system
The federal government maintains that the $ 3@@ 25 $ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue plan for health care is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that state government does not squ@@ ander funds .
The Federal Minister of Health T@@ an@@ ya Pol@@ liber@@ ek has announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is currently taking &apos; urgent measures &apos; to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
The funding , scheduled for four years , was decided after consultations with the government with the independent Member of T@@ as@@ man@@ man@@ ia An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&apos;@@ The government has proposed a emergency rescue package which , in our view , will solve the unique difficulties faced by the state &apos; , said Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
The $ 3@@ 25@@ m plan includes a $ 31 of $ 31 for non-@@ urgent sur@@ gical operations .
2 600 additional operations , particularly in the field of or@@ th@@ opa@@ e@@ dic sur@@ ger@@ y and cat@@ ar@@ act , will help to catch up .
Funds are also earmarked for clin@@ ics without meeting in H@@ ob@@ art and Lat@@ c@@ es@@ ton , better external care , training of medical frameworks , mental health services , and the deployment of electronic medical files in local hospitals .
‘ These investments respond to the idea that , according to the first line clin@@ ic@@ ians , this is the best way to treat T@@ as@@ man@@ ia ’ s health system , Mrs Pol@@ se@@ k said .
The Minister said that T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s government would be faced with a strict regime of preparation of reporting and accountability .
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends the additional funds .
A committee of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said today that the $ 3@@ 25 M will not count for “ unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate T@@ as@@ man@@ ia ’ s public health system . ”
He , however , congratulated the government on responding to the urgent request that he presented to Prime Minister early May .
“ I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the black list of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia from T@@ as@@ man@@ ia , ” Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said .
According to the government of the State , these additional non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But the opposition spokes@@ person for health care Peter D@@ ut@@ ton believes that today ’ s announcement is a “ ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft solution . ”
“ The reason we are here is that the government ’ s Labour government with@@ drew $ 4@@ 30 from its health system , ” he said on A@@ BC TV .
One cannot have a government government that gr@@ u@@ ds almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth with $ 300 M , and claims that it is a good day .
Mr D@@ ut@@ ton visited Mrs Pol@@ se@@ k to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , dec@@ la@@ res the supervisory body .
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and am@@ muni@@ tion full of toxic gas , declared the international chemical weapons monitoring body on Thursday , while violent clashes ra@@ ged in the north of the country , near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian activists has also said on Thursday that over 120 000 people have been killed since the civil war began in the country almost 3 years ago .
The announcement of the Organisation for the banning of Ch@@ em@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons ( IA@@ C ) has arrived one day in advance on the deadline of the
1 November , set by the Hague organisation ord@@ ering Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or “ un@@ us@@ able ” all chemical weapons production units and machines aimed at mi@@ xing toxic gas and filling am@@ muni@@ tion .
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying the chemical weapons in Dam@@ as@@ cus by mid-@@ 2014 .
With the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
It is believed that the country has around 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the s@@ ar@@ in s@@ ar@@ in agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was ra@@ ging on Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fi@@ ra , which , according to the experts , has a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites , reported the United Kingdom Monitoring Centre on Human Rights in Britain .
The group of activists , following the development of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria , on Thursday said that 120 2@@ 96 people were dead .
Among them , it is estimated that there were 61 civilians , 6 3@@ 65 of whom were children .
On the government side , it is estimated that 29 9@@ 54 members of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad ’ s armed forces died , 18 6@@ 78 of which were fighters from pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 Lebanese Hezbollah milit@@ ants .
Among the dead , it is also estimated that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ ters and some 5 3@@ 75 opposition fighters , many of whom were ali@@ en .
On July 25 , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since then .
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
al-@@ Assad ’ s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom have been connected to Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ai@@ da network groups , which have been in Sa@@ fi@@ ra for weeks .
The Monitoring Centre stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but did not give any prec@@ ision .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their duties , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsen@@ al in the midst of a civil war which continues to exist , within tight deadlines .
A statement by the ICA@@ O , working closely with the UN , stated that its team was “ now satisfied to control – and have destroyed – critical critical production and mix@@ ture machines .
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was planned at the moment &apos; .
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety , indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the IA@@ C said that both sites , according to Syria , were &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Sa@@ fi@@ ra &apos;s unity was one of the two sites that the O@@ IA@@ C inspectors were unable to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan of total destruction of its chemical weapons , which was approved in the following month by the O@@ IA@@ C Executive Committee .
&apos;@@ I sal@@ ute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult task ever undertaken by this organisation &apos; , stated the Director-General of the organisation Ah@@ met U@@ zu@@ escu , in a comment published by the ICA@@ O .
Now in its third year , the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels from the Assad government and its security forces , which are supported by the A@@ law@@ ite sec@@ t sec@@ t , a branch of Shia Islam .
On the other hand , the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory said that there had been a huge explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of La@@ k@@ ia .
The cause of the explosion remains unknown , he added .
Col@@ ère caused by the sentence imposed on one of the Bali bom@@ bers

The 45 year-old man was found guilty of mass killing for attacks against two night bo@@ xes in K@@ ut@@ a &apos;s popular tourist district , which caused the deaths of 20@@ 2 people , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and many injured .
He was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
Public prosecu@@ tors have asked for a sentence of life imprisonment , yet they could have called for the man , who was described as &apos; D@@ em@@ ol@@ tion M@@ an &apos; for his reputation as an expert in manufacturing bombs , to be sentenced to death .
The decision has revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Per@@ th who lost her two thir@@ ty-@@ year-old tw@@ inning , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction perpetrated by P@@ at@@ ek and the other con@@ spir@@ ators nearly 10 years ago .
On the te@@ ars she said that P@@ at@@ ek should have been sentenced to death .
I really believe that he should have gone along the same path as other men .
&apos;@@ He should be dra@@ gged before the execution &apos; , said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en to the A@@ A@@ P .
I have to live every day without having other grand@@ children or seeing my d@@ augh@@ ters .
The Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , charged in an external fo@@ d@@ der , explo@@ ded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in the P@@ ad@@ dy@@ e B@@ ar when a k@@ am@@ ik@@ a@@ ze j@@ um@@ ped a ba@@ g charged with explo@@ si@@ ves barely 20 seconds earlier .
He s@@ ank in the com@@ a after the attack and remained un@@ conscious for a month , and he is dead three times when he was with res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that P@@ at@@ ek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah responsible for the car@@ n@@ age – Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ l@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
To keep him alive , why there is no reason to keep him alive .
S@@ top 20 years in prison after killing 20@@ 2 people and injured hundreds of others , it is not much .
P@@ at@@ k is the last of Bali bom@@ bers to be brought to justice .
He had managed to avoid being cap@@ tured for nearly 10 years , but was finally arrested in January 2011 in Pakistan ’ s Ab@@ bot@@ ab@@ ad town , where US forces will kill al-@@ Qaeda ’ s former leader , Os@@ ama bin Laden , less than four months later .
During the trial , an F@@ B@@ I agent stated that intelligence reports revealed that P@@ at@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet B@@ in Laden with a view to re-@@ establishing links between the terrorist groups in Sou@@ theast Asia and al-@@ Qaeda .
He added Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en , he said .
Until recently , he did not care about the gri@@ ef that he could cause other people .
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year by cere@@ monies in Bali and Australia .
“ There will be many la@@ yers this year , ” Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en said .
P@@ are@@ k can appeal against his conviction , however .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on aircraft ( but not appeal with their mobile phones ) .
Air@@ lines passengers will be able to use their do@@ or@@ -to-@@ door electronic devices to read , work , play games , watch films , and listen to music – but not talk about their mobile phones – under the long-@@ awaited new directives published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another , declared the FA@@ A adminis@@ tr@@ ator Mic@@ hael H@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
Air@@ lines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their aeroplan@@ es comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training books for crew members and the rules concerning the con@@ forming of appli@@ ances to comply .
The FA@@ A said that it had already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of electronic appli@@ ances on their aircraft .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ B@@ lu@@ e are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&quot; In accordance with the plan , we could approve an extensive use of electronic appli@@ ances very soon &apos; , indicated the FA@@ A in a statement .
At present , passengers must switch off their mar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other appli@@ ances as soon as the plane doors are closed .
They are not supposed to r@@ ally them before the plane reaches 10 000 feet and the comm@@ ander gives the green light .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances when the plane takes off before the landing , and not to take them back until the aeroplan@@ e has been set up .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their aircraft during take@@ -@@ off , landing and soil rolling , declared the FA@@ A .
Most of the new aircraft aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i for higher al@@ titude should meet the criteria .
La@@ ura G@@ l@@ ent , Chair of the Association of Pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion@@ al-@@ F@@ light F@@ light , has been pleased with these changes .
“ Once the new policy was implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with the ha@@ uli@@ ers for that – it will benefit everyone , ” G@@ lad@@ ing explained in a statement .
We are , frankly , tired of being &apos; h@@ alls &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet for sur@@ f@@ ing , exchange em@@ ail@@ s and M@@ S@@ S , or down@@ load data below 10 000 feet , declared the agency .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other aircraft on board .
So , not Wor@@ ds W@@ it@@ ch Fri@@ ends , the S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble , style game of A@@ le@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win on his s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one in 2011 when he was thrown out of the air from an American Air@@ lines aircraft after they refused to ext@@ ingu@@ ish his or her job . On the other hand , the apparatus was kept on the do@@ or@@ step .
And heavi@@ er appli@@ ances like lap@@ top@@ s will always have to be side , because they could inj@@ ure someone if they ste@@ ered through the cab@@ in .
Mob@@ ile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A can lift the ban on certain electronic appli@@ ances during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Last month Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of the National Transport Safety expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws said that mobile phones were always regarded as a risk .
‘ mobile phones are a real problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the F@@ CC@@ C , that they could distur@@ b mobile telephone rela@@ ys if they are used on board ’ , has declared Ros@@ en@@ ker .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorise the wider use of personal electronic appli@@ ances .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has increased in recent years to rela@@ x restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ ator Mc@@ C@@ ast@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o , argue that there is no valid safety reason for such bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of appli@@ ances has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous .
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to switch off their appli@@ ances or do so deliberately .
The FA@@ A began to limit the use of electronic appli@@ ances in 1996 as a result of reports on the presence of navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying F@@ M radi@@ os , the high-tech g@@ ad@@ ge@@ -@@ tech .
New lin@@ ers depend much more on electrical systems than earlier generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
Air@@ lines allow their passengers to use the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to cru@@ ise al@@ abilities for several years .
modified aircraft to host W@@ i-@@ F@@ i systems also better resist interference .
The vast majority of aircraft aircraft should make it possible for electronic appli@@ ances to be used more widely under the new directives , as stated in H@@ er@@ ta .
Today ’ s electronic devices usually em@@ it much lower radio trans@@ missions than earlier generations of appli@@ ances .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic books , for example , only em@@ it minimum trans@@ missions when we turn a page .
But trans@@ missions are stronger when they down@@ load or send data .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is one of those who are pressing for the restrictions on the use of electronic appli@@ ances to be rela@@ xed by passengers .
In 2011 , company leaders instruc@@ ted an electronic lec@@ tu@@ rers air@@ lin@@ er K@@ ind@@ le and have ste@@ ered it to see whether there were problems , but there was none .
This led to mixed feelings about the FA@@ A ’ s Advisory Committee on whether or not the use of equipment presents a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said that he believed that interference from appli@@ ances was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee have said that there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots indicating that aircraft can interfere with the systems of an aircraft , and most of them are very old .
However , the committee recommended that the FA@@ A allows pil@@ ots to ask passengers to switch off their equipment during landing to the instruments under conditions of low visibility .
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes , calling them sensible arrangements for technology with technology .
&apos;@@ We are pleased that the FA@@ A recognises that enjo@@ y@@ able passenger experience is not incompatible with security &apos; , stated Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , President and Director of U@@ . Tra@@ vel Association .
A H@@ em@@ ic@@ ycle of a platform in the North Sea has been released in nature .
A bir@@ d , bat@@ tered after being exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea , has been released in nature .
Last month , there was a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter from A@@ ber@@ de@@ en ’ s hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en ’ s hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter before he was handed over by the Scottish S@@ PC@@ A in his Al@@ l@@ o@@ a rescue centre .
The director of the centre , Col@@ in S@@ ed@@ don , said : &apos; This pi@@ e of water was probably a hi@@ de@@ ous migratory who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent win@@ ds in the North Sea . &apos;
It seems that the bir@@ d exhausted would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform .
He added : “ He was unable to fly again , so we were cont@@ acted to help . ”
The pi@@ e of water was healthy when it was released .
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain ?
Business for Brit@@ on was launched in April with the promise of re@@ uniting businesses and defining what wealth and employment creat@@ ors want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
To this end , we commissioned the wid@@ est and most complete investigation of British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , businesses and the EU .
Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v questioned more than 1@@ ,000 business leaders , broadly representative of all sizes of business , sectors , and regions in Britain .
The findings of the inquiry will be a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of businesses are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on countries that modernise and develop while the EU states are stag@@ n@@ ating .
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of European institutional ar@@ can@@ e reform .
When asked about specific political points – ranging from regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should return to West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market has caused general dis@@ content , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40 % of large companies , traditionally the most pro-European , even agree .
Last but not least , our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue the initiatives to change the Treaty and to develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics .
This conclusion , which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a “ significant change ” that re@@ sto@@ res power in the UK .
The stakes are high – to change the Treaty and to represent Britain ’ s interests better would see a 16 % shift in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not doubt for one moment that this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate Britain &apos;s terms of membership of the EU .
It also shows that businesses hope that re@@ negotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to represent the interests of British business better , since the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for business this means once again placing the emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels .

Alex@@ e@@ i Mill@@ er of Gaz@@ pro@@ m says that Bulgaria ’ s gas pipeline aug@@ urs a new gas era .
The start of building the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s director .
“ An historic event took place today : construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , Europe ’ s most important project , ” explained Alex@@ e@@ i Mill@@ er , Gaz@@ pro@@ m ’ s Director-General , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire continent of Europe .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its Ukrainian counterpart , a country through which most of Russia ’ s gas goes to Europe , increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes , adds the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &apos; forever . &apos;
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas from South Stream at a reduced tariff as soon as the whole project is set up in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m has indicated that construction should start in other countries down@@ stream by the end of the year .
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
Time to create the world ’ s largest marine reserve
The island of Pit@@ c@@ ai@@ an wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world , announced the daily newspaper of the New Ta@@ hi@@ i newspaper , the news from Rad@@ io Australia .
This island , in the eastern Pacific archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last British South Pacific territory , half-@@ way between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory is 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , if there are three other small ne@@ ar@@ by islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the ma@@ id@@ en of the Bou@@ d@@ ty , the episo@@ de in the English Nav@@ y &apos;s history , which gave rise to three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adap@@ tations .
A few dozen inhabitants , mostly des@@ c@@ endants of the Bou@@ d@@ ty muti@@ l@@ ations , still live Pit@@ c@@ air@@ in , and their income depends 95 % on London ’ s generosity .
The Council of Cyprus unanimously voted for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , namely 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , which correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the may@@ or of the island went to London to ask Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ n , the May@@ or of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r , believes that creating such a protected zone would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island .
The project must be accepted by the English Govern@@ or of Pit@@ can@@ n , who is resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to s@@ nu@@ b these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in Pit@@ c@@ aid , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance in the area , and there is no port where military surveillance vessels can be placed .
As for France , it must already conduct the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 k@@ m@@ 2 of the French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia E@@ E@@ Z .
The FA@@ A rela@@ xed restrictions on the use of electronic g@@ ad@@ gets on aircraft – but it will always be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones .

China ’ s Li@@ ving V@@ ice Govern@@ or
A former deputy govern@@ or of Ji@@ in province in north-@@ east China was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption .
Ex@@ c@@ ked from the Communist Party in July 2012 , Ti@@ an@@ an@@ en X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of affecting more than 19 million y@@ u@@ ans of bri@@ bes , reporting Chinese official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Govern@@ or , who was also President of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public institution , helped companies and responsible companies to obtain contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first interim tribunal in Beijing on his micro@@ lo@@ g .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the Communist Party itself .
If the head of state promised that justice would be as in@@ trac@@ table with the powerful &quot; tig@@ ers &quot; - j@@ uni@@ or officials - only a handful of high-@@ ranking officials have been sentenced , including former executives of the oil giant Pe@@ tro@@ ch@@ a .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CC@@ P leader in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , who was convicted in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest offices in the state .
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-@@ corruption system by , for example , creating an independent party .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees accused of sexual aggression following claims made against J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord at a Ro@@ yal Commission hearing .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees in New Wales were accused of sexual assault on children following allegations against the Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h educ@@ ator , J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , in 2011 at a Ro@@ yal Commission hearing on child sexual abuse .
However , in its opening statement before the Commission , the Y@@ M@@ A stated that it &apos; had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children within its organisation &apos; .
Man@@ aging Director Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ re was asked about two cases : an employee at the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was accused of child pornography and a P@@ hy@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all was found guilty of sexual assa@@ ults on children in the centre where he was working in the centre where he worked . That was in 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ re said in G@@ ail F@@ ur@@ st , a lawyer to the Commission , that he was aware of the first case but he was not aware of the second case .
He also acknowledged that the opening declaration of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was in@@ accurate by pointing out , ‘ external controls of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A were carried out and indicated that children ’ s safety was an absolute priority for the organisation ’ .
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A had been informed that it had received seconds of the worst of four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communic@@ ations carried out in August of this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who began working in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that the management of staff was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had om@@ itted to check that the employees knew that they had to report any violation of children &apos;s security policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord was convicted of sexual assa@@ ults on twelve boys during the two years he worked in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A .
He was sentenced to a minimum prison sentence of six years .
But Mr Ha@@ re rejected the idea that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord &apos;s failings in the safety of children .
Members of staff testi@@ fied that they had observed some shortcomings , in particular the fact that Lord left alone with children , kept them in private , put them on their k@@ nees , told them that he loved them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone .
Dan@@ i@@ el@@ le O@@ k@@ w@@ ell , who was controlled by Lord and who had asked for training for children &apos;s protection because she was concerned about her behaviour , indicated that she found the head of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h , J@@ ac@@ o@@ v@@ at Bar@@ n@@ at , who ho@@ sted Lord Bar@@ n@@ at , who ho@@ sted Lord Bar@@ n@@ at . Very da@@ un@@ ting and difficult to approach most of the time . &apos;
The Director-General said that he rejected the testi@@ monies of the staff that they were reluctant to point out these shortcomings to their hier@@ arch@@ ical superi@@ ors .
Instead , he said that the friendly relations that they had with Lord d &apos;@@ ord mud@@ d@@ led their judgment , which meant that they did not report his actions .
Mr Ha@@ re said he had expressed his point of view before the South Y@@ M@@ C@@ A council in New Wales that for the organisation the lesson of the &apos; J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord incident &apos; should not be &apos; reporting &apos; by staff , and the Council agreed with him .
Mr Ha@@ re said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were made was taken by the Director General of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A responsible for children &apos;s services , Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ ley .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence , but that it was &apos; over-@@ ze@@ alous &apos; and that it had been poorly implemented .
Y@@ M@@ A in New Wales was not a safe organisation for children at the time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord was used there , in 2009 and 2011 , declared the expert on sexual violence on children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ am@@ b@@ one at the University of G@@ ri@@ ot University , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ am@@ b@@ one . This is something that the Commission has to say to the Commission .
He said that there were &apos; serious problems &apos; in recruitment , control , initi@@ ation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to re-@@ become Prime Minister , but he recognizes that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office , the 59 year-old man made his views known on various national policies .
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade , Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet ’ s special envoy for the Middle East peace process .
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to E@@ ring Stand@@ ard in London : &apos; Yes , of course , but it is likely that this will happen , so ... &apos;
When many experts on the street met in Cardiff to confront and win the tro@@ ph@@ y of the year , they knew that competition would be tough .
But no one expected a three-@@ year-old child to win .
Not yet at school , and only a few months after having had his first weapons , the small and small She@@ t@@ land T@@ off@@ é@@ e and his h@@ et@@ land She@@ t@@ land T@@ off@@ e@@ e have been tro@@ t@@ ted out with great ease and won the first prize , leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors .
The two in@@ separ@@ able – which are the same size – were welcomed for presentation , attitudes and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sun@@ n@@ y@@ bank center in R@@ ud@@ y near Cardiff .
When he was standing up against men and women with e@@ leg@@ ant male h@@ ats , he was wearing his ca@@ me@@ l ’ s ca@@ p in a rela@@ xed way to challenge his 2@@ -year old T@@ off@@ al pon@@ y around the run@@ way .
The judges were welcomed by the judges for their natural qualities of un@@ common comp@@ il@@ ation for a child of his age .
And T@@ off@@ e@@ e received very good marks for her presentation and personality .
F@@ off@@ s was present for her 3@@ r@@ d birth@@ day in March last year and has since been involved with his She@@ t@@ land pon@@ y on a daily basis .
His mother , 30 years , said : ‘ F@@ T@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e make an excellent du@@ o . ’
They stood against and against all , but both of them r@@ ated the gold cut and the ro@@ t .
It was only the second time he had conc@@ eded with T@@ off@@ e@@ e and we were fool@@ ish that he won .
On the track , people who did not know him thought that he was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to be photo@@ graph@@ ed with him .
This young bo@@ y , the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ ow V@@ ale , in South Wales , follows the foot@@ steps of his A@@ unt Sharon H@@ ow@@ el@@ ls , who has been involved in competi@@ tions for more than 10 years .
Mrs H@@ ow@@ el@@ ls said : ‘ There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applau@@ ded . ’
He went through the whole of the run@@ way , and even if he seemed to be a little small , he has done a wonderful job .
Fe@@ w animals – he ad@@ ore hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors , and rural areas , and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens .
As he began , he will almost certainly take part in the Ch@@ al of the year ’ s demonstration – and I am sure he will make a great achievement .
A spokes@@ person for the annual demonstration has said : &apos; There is only one 3 years , but he knows how to drive his pon@@ y &apos; .
They are a good team .
Jud@@ ges noted that F@@ é@@ t@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e were presenting and challenging the run@@ way .
They are looking for effective te@@ am@@ work between the pon@@ y and dra@@ in@@ er – F@@ T@@ off@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e have been the best on the run@@ way .
I am sure that his fine clo@@ thes helped F@@ en@@ on , he really was proud .
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal “ will be res@@ hu@@ ff@@ led ”
A Chinese newspaper that issued a front page call for the release of a journalist accused of def@@ am@@ ation will be re@@ worked , declaring a press regulator .
The Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou New Ex@@ press published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Ch@@ en later admitted on television that he had accepted bri@@ bes to make stories about a semi-@@ public society .
Now the New Ex@@ press is going to undergo a “ complete res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le , ” declared the regulator .
The “ res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le ” stems from Gu@@ ang@@ donation ’ s administration for Pres@@ se and E@@ di@@ tion , Rad@@ io , F@@ il@@ m , and Tele@@ vision .
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Ex@@ press , belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g group E@@ ing Ne@@ ws , had published several er@@ ron@@ eous articles on the Z@@ o@@ om@@ on listed company between September 2012 and August 2013 .
“ The wording of New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organised , ” the regulator said in a statement .
He indicated that he had decided to ‘ impose an administrative sanction of Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press card ’ .
He also “ ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g Ne@@ ws to undertake a comprehensive New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he conduct an investigation into New Ex@@ press officials at New Ex@@ press , and immediately re@@ visit the newspaper ’ s leadership team . ”
Ch@@ en wrote a number of articles for the New Ex@@ press on alleged financial irregularities from a shipy@@ ard manufacturer called Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion .
After his arrest , his newspaper twice published a first page call for his release , writing that he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television station where he admitted that he had published false stories about money .
&quot; In this case , I har@@ med Z@@ o@@ om@@ li@@ on as well as the media industry and his ability to win public confidence &apos; , he said to the public television network C@@ CC@@ TV .
I did so mainly because I was running after money and celebr@@ ity .
I have realised my mistake .
Following the apologies of Mr Ch@@ en , New Ex@@ press published his apologies on the front page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects have recently made a@@ val@@ an@@ che .

The radioactive v@@ ap@@ our le@@ ak detected in one of the two nuclear he@@ at@@ ers of the Charles de Gaul@@ le , in mid-@@ October and when the ship was at sea , was &apos; safe for the sa@@ il@@ ors &apos; , but is not without consequences for the Mar@@ ine .
The Ro@@ yal has just confirmed to us the &apos; un@@ availability &apos; of the ship until &apos; mid-@@ November &apos; , &apos; time to take the necessary corrective measures &apos; on the reactor .
For its part , D@@ CNS , a defen@@ der of defence comm@@ u@@ ting , as@@ sures that its teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , who were sent in the V@@ ar for the opportunity , &apos; are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier &apos; .
For them , among other things , it is a question of changing a failed driver of heat .
Everything is being done to ensure that the Char@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le can carry out its deployment at the end of 2013 , but that is why it is so .
And the National Mari@@ e is to certi@@ fy that &apos; this does not in any way call into question the &apos; nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion programme &apos; programme .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaul@@ le comes out of an interim period of six months .
He had de@@ lin@@ e@@ ated from T@@ oul@@ on in mid-@@ October for training .
In particular , this is to describe the young pil@@ ots of hunting as pil@@ ots .
A &apos; small ch@@ al@@ k &apos; , restricted to the area of contain@@ ment of the reactor , had then taken place on the flagship of the French fleet .
According to the National Mari@@ e , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a great deal of dis@@ content on the part of the people I met : the mon@@ str@@ ous re@@ valuation of their properties , the delu@@ ge of taxes , the cost of permits of all kinds , administrative costs to be brought to an end .
In short , there is no limit on our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of dollars squ@@ an@@ dered could be saved in order to allow a lot of taxation that respects those who pay .
Any money abduc@@ ted by taxpayers dimin@@ ishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impover@@ ishment .
In S@@ aw@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , we do not get bo@@ gged down with the s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ous expenditure and the maintenance of lame duc@@ ks : a deficit cultural centre , a strong subsidy to energy City , etc .
If these installations are not profitable , whether they are sold to the private company or are destroyed .
It is also dist@@ ressing to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come .
However , I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a kind of industrial inc@@ ub@@ ator , but at what cost for tax pay@@ ers ?
It is not for public start-@@ ups to invest in such companies , but for the private sector , based on consumer demand .
Citizens have been pleased to learn that the la@@ kes in Fisheries and Pi@@ les will continue to supply the city of drinking water .
As a result of the departure of all the industries ( major water users ) and the widespread decline in the population , the use of water has decreased considerably throughout the territory .
Without wishing to waste it , the city will never fail to be water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly watered down .
To sum up , it is easy to achieve great things with others &apos; money .
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet .
With gross debt of over $ 200 million , this city is no longer even able to buy a sty@@ l@@ en without a loan regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years by ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ makers most of them , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer would do worse .
Dec@@ lining of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railways
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico , with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation , and electricity systems , has been discovered .
The American authorities described the tunnel 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secre@@ ts they had ever seen .
The tunnel , a z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag@@ er of almost six long foot@@ b@@ alls , links w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ j@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go , the United States .
The area is full of un@@ defined w@@ are@@ houses , which can easily conceal the use of dru@@ g@@ s-@@ loaded lorries .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of sight , they told the authorities .
The authorities have seized 8@@ .5 tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel discovered the tunnel , according to judicial records .
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were accused of mari@@ ju@@ ana possession and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e with the intention of selling .
They run a prison sentence from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced .
In No@@ g@@ ales , in Ari@@ z@@ ona , the traffickers exploit extensive underground dra@@ in@@ age channels .
The tunnel is the important eigh@@ th passage discovered in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the largest tun@@ n@@ els were discovered following the mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in central Mexico in October , raising a challenge for drug car@@ t@@ els who have to deliver their products quickly to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 y@@ ards f@@ itted with railway tr@@ acks from Ti@@ ju@@ ana ’ s house to two w@@ are@@ houses in San Di@@ e@@ go .
The British police issued an extradition mandate against Ass@@ ange .
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks foun@@ der Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge at the Ecu@@ ador Am@@ bas@@ ade in London and asked for political asylum .
Scot@@ land Y@@ ard said that she had issued an “ surrender opinion ” to Austr@@ ali@@ an by 40 years , asking him to stand for a police station , adding that if he did not , he would be likely to be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited in Sweden as a result of allegations of sex crime , having exhausted all possible channels under British law after the Supreme Court invali@@ dated his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of this month .
F@@ earing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the US , it found refuge at the Ecu@@ ador Am@@ bas@@ ade in London on June 19 , asking that South American country political asylum .
Scot@@ land Y@@ ard has “ issued an opinion for a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man asking him to stand for a police office , at the time and time of choice , ” declared a spokesman .
It continues to violate the conditions of its b@@ ail .
The Ambassador refused to comment on the issue of the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange fears being extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of es@@ pion@@ age , having un@@ ve@@ iled more than 250 000 American diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website fighting the secret information .
How Bi@@ ome@@ try will inv@@ ade our lives
Fin@@ n ’ t words of passing in order to gain access to his mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one or pay for his or her purchases ?
American , French , or Japanese researchers are predic@@ ting a future in which we will be recognised by the biometric sen@@ s@@ ors of computers and computers .
Mor@@ ph@@ o ’ s deputy chief executive , Ber@@ ph@@ o Di@@ di@@ er , even believes that “ the century will be biometric ” .
Only biome@@ tr@@ ics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a world as trans@@ ver@@ ted and transnational as the Internet .
Pri@@ vate life organisations confirm this exc@@ itement for biome@@ tr@@ ics , but are worried about it .
In 2011 and in France alone , the National Commission for Information and Freedom has allowed 7@@ 74 finger@@ printing systems , hand@@ -@@ in-@@ hand form , or ve@@ ter@@ an network systems in companies , administrations and can@@ te@@ ens ...
&apos;@@ Everyone will soon be able to be identified anywhere and when &apos; Justi@@ n Bro@@ o@@ k@@ man , who is responsible for the privacy of consumers in the CD@@ T@@ s ( C@@ enter for Democracy and Technology ) , in Washington .
The reasons for such optimism , among some , and pessimis@@ m , among others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ try will be based on new techniques , which will enable new services to be made to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are fingerprints , the hand of hand and the ve@@ il network of breaks or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;@@ For example , some people who work concrete are un@@ read@@ able and their fingerprints are un@@ read@@ able &apos; , according to Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , the technical director of the identity area in Th@@ ales , Security and Security .
And the collection , as well as the verification of the ve@@ il network and the hand of the hand , assumes a specific and voluntary gesture by the people .
It is both a security - one cannot capture these data un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - and one disadvantage : the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time .
As a result , research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches , such as recognition of face or i@@ ris ( the co@@ o@@ ked part ) .
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of sen@@ s@@ ors and the ability to calculate the computers needed for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The accuracy of fac@@ ial recognition has increased ten@@ fold over the last five years , calcul@@ ating Cy@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , the Director of Europe &apos;s R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border cross@@ ings using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or an ir@@ ony on the move .
&apos;@@ Today we are carrying out research into the recognition of the voice or the way of wal@@ king with noise sen@@ s@@ ors , but we need a silent environment &apos; , says S@@ ri@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , Director of Security Research in In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
There is also hope and concern about DNA , which is a single and inf@@ am@@ ous one .
&apos;@@ In the current state of knowledge it can be considered the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirming S@@ op@@ hi@@ e V@@ ul@@ li@@ and Ta@@ ver@@ e , Director of Stu@@ dies , Innovation and Pro@@ spec@@ ts in C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But DNA analysis is still very long and costly .
NE@@ EC is proposing a value for EUR 9@@ 0@@ ,000 to judicial police services to analyse DNA s@@ amples in the place of a crime and within an hour .
The use of biome@@ tr@@ ics is divided into two groups : identification ( recognising one person among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( ensuring that the person is the person it claims to be ) .
The identification until now concerned the issue of identity papers : the biometric elements must be confronted ( fingerprints , photo@@ graph@@ s and i@@ ris ) with the information that the state poss@@ esses on all citizens who have already been fixed .
This makes it possible to ensure that someone does not try to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison may have other applications .
Thus , it proposes recognition of the V@@ IP at the entry of a ho@@ tel or shop .
&apos;@@ We are recovering the images of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compar@@ ing them to the photo@@ graph@@ s of cele@@ bri@@ ties who circul@@ ate freely on the Internet &apos; , according to Dan@@ y N@@ assi@@ f , who , at N@@ EC France , was responsible for commercial development for biometric identi@@ fi@@ ers .
Another use is to take a picture of a dis@@ card that is qu@@ eu@@ ing up in a shop , to keep up with its progress thanks to fac@@ ial recognition and to calculate waiting times .
auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation concerned , at the outset , physical access ( borders , protected local , can@@ te@@ ens ... ) or logical ( opening a computer ) .
More recently , there has been control over attendance .
&apos;@@ A biometric high point avoi@@ ds the phenomenon of the C@@ ain which is leading for another &apos; , C@@ y@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , Ac@@ cen@@ ture .
More and more , however , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also affect transactions , especially those carried out using the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to take money away from some distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric read@@ er : it re@@ places the h@@ int of the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is tested in V@@ ill@@ en@@ eu@@ vel@@ -@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and in An@@ dro@@ ol@@ i by Nat@@ ural Security in partnership with banks and teachers of large-scale distribution : when it comes to paying in shop with its banking card , the customer does not ta@@ p his code , but introduces his or her own . In a read@@ er who s@@ its the cal@@ ves .
The experiment is planned for six months .
If it is conclu@@ sive , biometric players may soon arrive among the French traders .
D@@ oub@@ ts to reassure users
There are three ways of making biome@@ tr@@ ics attractive to the general public .
The first is that it can save time .
&apos;@@ If , thanks to biome@@ tr@@ ics , a customer remains in c@@ ash@@ -@@ minute less than 30 seconds less , explains the director of a great surface .
The second is to offer person@@ alised services : in a few years &apos; time , a voice ser@@ ver will be able to recognise your voice and propose tail@@ or-@@ made options .
And finally , reassuring the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;@@ finger@@ printing &apos; is stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos;s identities are on a second basis : the correlation between the two numbers is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure box , which is blocking if attempts are made to move it &apos; , as Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , Th@@ ales lists &apos; .
But because there are no in-depth studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
Pri@@ v@@ ate-@@ protection specialists continue to worry .
&apos;@@ The progress of fac@@ ial recognition , the proliferation of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and the huge amount of photo@@ graph@@ s available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or P@@ ic@@ sa , fear me the worst : widespread surveillance &apos; , predic@@ tion An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , the Commissioner for the Protection of Pri@@ v@@ acy in Canada .
A driver running 2@@ 10 km / h with a drink hot between the leg@@ s was given £ 1@@ ,000 .
A motor@@ ist was fin@@ ed £ 1 000 for running at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink that was balanced between his leg@@ s .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ i , 35 years of Ti@@ p@@ ter@@ e in Es@@ sex , was re@@ pen@@ ted with his Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 to B@@ ain@@ tre@@ e on May 27 .
When the police arrested him , they discovered the be@@ verage between his leg@@ s .
In the Col@@ ch@@ ester Court of First In@@ stance , H@@ ow@@ i acknowledged the infringement of driving without the necessary prudence and attention .
The seven points that have been withdrawn on his permit have led to a six-month permit withdrawal .
It has also been sentenced to pay fees amounting to £ 90 and a £ 100 of £ 100 .
A Tax on Foreign home@@ owners to bur@@ st the London bubble
The Treasury has temporarily calculated the measure of capital gains tax , but expects a final decision by Os@@ borne Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 budget , has put a 7 % right for properties costing over £ 2 and the annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold property . Within the framework of a society rather than individual .
The tre@@ e right already applies to the residential properties of the West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ el@@ sea , and accounts for £ 7@@ 08 M on the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , and Scotland . The north-@@ east , north-@@ west and region of Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and H@@ um@@ ber put together .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &apos; Following the increase in the right of stamp on high-@@ value properties and the introduction of anti-@@ avo@@ id@@ al law in this area , it is very difficult to argue that high-@@ value properties are under@@ imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &apos;
“ But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the current re@@ tic@@ ent owners to sell , ” he added .
Au@@ tonom@@ ous housing – the top 5-@@ 10 % of the highest housing prices in the housing market – in the sou@@ th@@ west of London that stret@@ ches from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ b@@ all@@ on , has increased by a record 1.@@ 8 % in the last year .
P@@ ric@@ es in the centre of London have regular growth per year by 5.@@ 6 % , but have been over@@ shad@@ owed by a growing &apos; internal market &apos; , the south-@@ west of the town , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and ( 6@@ .5 % ) with a recovery , according to Stu@@ dies studies . W@@ r@@ ong .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted the way in which the dog ’ s tail is tied to its mood .
Pre@@ vious studies showed that happy dogs were more qu@@ eu@@ ing to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nerv@@ ous dogs win more to the left .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and respond to them .
Professor Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ a , a neuro@@ scientists from the University of T@@ ren@@ te , said : “ Everyone knows that , in humans , the left side and the brain side of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimul@@ i that ar@@ ouse positive or negative emotions . . ”
Here we have tried to see what was happening in other species .
He added that , in the case of humans , the brain &apos;s right to the left was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and that the two hemis@@ p@@ here were playing a different role in emotions .
To know more about how dogs respond to other dogs ’ dis@@ orderly movements , researchers have been watching animals watching films in other dogs .
They measured the heart of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a explained : “ We have presented films with films with other dogs – either a nat@@ ur@@ alist version or a sil@@ ver to avoid any further confusion – and we have been able to ta@@ m@@ per with the tail and present it as going to the left or the right . . ”
When the animals saw a dog without an expression winning the right ( from the point of view of the dog that won the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , they remained perfectly rela@@ xed .
But when they pe@@ a@@ ked mainly to the left ( again from the point of view of the dog that won the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , their heart was accelerated and they looked anxious .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communic@@ ating with each other thanks to these movements .
Instead , he believes that dogs know by experience the movements that they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet with other dogs on several occasions , and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement qu@@ eu@@ ing up to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right leads to a less friendly attitude , you will react according to that experience &apos; .
Res@@ ear@@ chers point out that the results could enable owners , ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arians and traders to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The ca@@ ve@@ at expert John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a prof@@ essor at the University of Veterinary Sci@@ ences at B@@ ris@@ to@@ l University , said that it was not the first study to look at the importance of the left and right in the can@@ ine species .
Last year , a team from the University of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n discovered that dogs were turning to the left when they watched an aggressive dog and right when it was a jo@@ y@@ ous dog .
And , in another scientific study carried out by the University of Vic@@ tor@@ ia in Canada , he said : “ dogs would be more easily to a bo@@ y dog when his qu@@ eu@@ ing w@@ ins to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what was stated in the Italian study . ”
He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully regard the animals of films or ro@@ bo@@ ts as dogs .
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
“ Although many parts of different ma@@ m@@ m@@ als indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception , ” he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other .

Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will name his first Car@@ d@@ inal in February
Pope Franc@@ is will appoint new Car@@ d@@ inal to the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22 , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on Thursday .
Car@@ d@@ inal are men of the highest church church in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect him , so Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor .
There are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ d@@ in@@ os .
But , as soon as a car@@ d@@ in@@ al reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer participate in election of a Pope – so it amounts to a group of 120 “ voters . ”
In a statement announcing the new , Fa@@ ther F@@ eder@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ ar@@ di , a spokesman for the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an , said that a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony in which b@@ ish@@ ops will be raised with the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as the name of Car@@ d@@ inal . It is a matter of con@@ scienti@@ ous thinking .
“ Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is decided to communicate his decision to conven@@ e the February cons@@ is@@ try in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of Car@@ d@@ inal from different parts of the world , ” said Lom@@ bar@@ di .
J@@ ack Val@@ er@@ al@@ o of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February the number of voters will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope generally appointed as many car@@ d@@ in@@ os as he had needed to ensure that the number of Car@@ d@@ inal voters reached 120 and so many car@@ d@@ in@@ os over 80 years of age .
The next year will be important because it will be the first since Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is ’ election in March this year , Val@@ er@@ al@@ o .
At the moment , there is some kind of tendency towards Europe and , in particular , Italy .
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will call the world ’ s Car@@ d@@ inal to restore the balance , ” he added .
40 % of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of them represent them .
The Car@@ d@@ inal will also be the first to be chosen since Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is formed the Council of Car@@ d@@ inal , a group of eight Car@@ d@@ inal from all over the world who is responsible for looking at ways of reforming the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided on his own .
“ Now Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is chose these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , ” Val@@ er@@ al@@ o explained .
He added that he was &apos; perfectly possible &apos; that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is requests advice to the Car@@ d@@ in@@ os .
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new .
Val@@ er@@ o pointed out that the po@@ pes generally raise b@@ ish@@ ops representing large communities as Car@@ d@@ inal , but that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is was “ full of sur@@ prises – so we do not know who he will name . ”

O@@ ut of certain pic@@ tu@@ ps , the seats before could present a defec@@ t in the inc@@ lin@@ ation mechanism .
As a result , cases do not comply with federal safety standards for vehicles with regard to support .
&apos;@@ If the vehicle is caught by the back , it may not properly protect passengers , thereby increasing the risk of injury &apos; , according to the statement made at the site of the National High@@ way Tra@@ ffic@@ king Administration ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) .
The models recalled were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of G@@ M pic@@ tu@@ ps began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009 .
GM has informed the owners of default in the first half of October .
The N@@ H@@ T@@ SA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16 days of government activity , which slow@@ ed down the growth of vehicle sales in October .
S@@ hor@@ t@@ ado and Sierra Leone sales , which were re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , rose by about 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , G@@ M Friday declared .

A worker dies from concrete blocks of concrete .
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks of concrete , on Thursday the day before mid@@ day in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The drama took place at 11 : 00 on the streets of Mar@@ qu@@ et@@ te , near the inter@@ section of the street Be@@ au@@ well in the r@@ oun@@ d-@@ up of Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La Pe@@ ry .
In all likelihood , work on the foundations has been taking place there for some time .
A mo@@ ve@@ ated wall of foundation has been erec@@ ted over the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had arrived on the site to recover his tools .
I was travelling by car and saw the wall cr@@ umbling with a great cl@@ oud of smoke , Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I am lan@@ ded and I have been removed from the big b@@ ric@@ ks that have recovered it .
One saw only part of his back , so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in the fif@@ ties working for a co@@ ff@@ ra@@ m company .
Re@@ li@@ ef manoeuv@@ res have been tried by the emergency services , but without success .
M@@ an has not survived his serious injuries .
A inspec@@ tor of the Committee on Health and Safety at work has been sent to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
Obama ’ s H@@ ope of desper@@ ation
I voted twice for President Obama , believing in the possibility of a change .
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts to fo@@ ol the Republican Party ’ s obstruc@@ tion@@ ism .
obstruc@@ tion@@ ism does not excuse the difficulties of the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are site and the attacks by d@@ ron@@ es .
The memory of Obama ’ s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what might have happened .
N@@ a@@ i@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is studying in the 2@@ n@@ d year of medicine at the Har@@ v@@ ard Medic@@ ine Medic@@ ine .
I am reading a star@@ k@@ ly sad book these days .
It is a book which I thought would encourage me during the mor@@ o@@ sen@@ ess of the 2@@ n@@ d year of medicine and would give me hope .
It is called “ The Aud@@ ac@@ ty to W@@ in ’ , and it is the m@@ emo@@ irs of Barack Obama ’ s 2008 presidential campaign .
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and la@@ v@@ ish myself , this book brings me back at the time when policies inspired millions of people and speeches could cut you off .
The election ended with a land@@ sli@@ de victory , and news presen@@ ters took time to think about the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des m@@ our@@ ned and my parents kept all the newspapers they found .
A young team of vision@@ aries moved to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama ’ s transition period before he took office in 2008 , he had 82 % fav@@ orable views .
And then I am closing the book .
Re@@ turning to the present is a difficult aw@@ ak@@ ening , as a way out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days of optimism , such as distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change has really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put to the credit of Obama great achievements , since the passage of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ( Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ) until the departure of Iraq from our army , through the end of the “ neither seen nor known ” and the assassination of Os@@ ama bin Laden .
In addition , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But , having defended Obama ’ s administration on many occasions in front of my pe@@ ers , and my fellow Members , I can no longer provide an explanation .
I am on the ver@@ ge of political despair .
Republican ob@@ struction cannot explain foreign leaders ’ ta@@ pping and attacks on innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency has data on Americans ’ privacy , or the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers who reveal the government ’ s mis@@ deeds .
It cannot justify the assassination of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , evasion of public funding and over@@ spending during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the &apos; more aggressive ... since the Ni@@ xon administration &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the im@@ possibility of design@@ ing a simple website for more than three years after the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I do not know whether that is what I was expecting .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .
Of course , the election function is not predictable , because the political opposition party and events that occur by chance , like the New@@ ton massacre , influence our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples that I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what distur@@ bs me .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a mud@@ d@@ led and unclear alternative that did not seem to be able to determine his policies or positions .
I felt that Obama , elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections , would make the promises that we had been hearing about for so long .
However , while the favourable opinion index has plun@@ ged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I am happy with the many promises that have been made .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses to Clinton ’ s Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania Pri@@ v@@ ile@@ ges .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting , he told his team that they had to go down the right path and remain true to their cause .
“ I want us to focus on our talent , ” he said .
We must remember who we are .
Five years ago , Mr President , I no longer agree with you .
The views expressed in that comment are only those of N@@ ath@@ i@@ el Mor@@ ris .
On Friday , at 3 p.m. , a violent col@@ lis@@ ion between a mo@@ to and a car took place in R@@ é@@ tin@@ o in F@@ l@@ é@@ l@@ o .
The late , J@@ on@@ a@@ than , 26 years of F@@ é@@ l@@ on , was not a mon@@ ster .
Despite rapid relief , he died during this fron@@ tal col@@ lis@@ ion .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims that MEP Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system .
The M@@ P bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire C@@ live Pal@@ mer argues that Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his d@@ augh@@ ters could be pregnant and benefit from this system .
The mining of mining , which challenges the payment of a carbon tax of $ 6 M , has made this argument in an attempt to remove questions about any conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s girls were ready to benefit personally from these policies .
&apos;@@ It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his d@@ augh@@ ters is pregnant , he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave &apos; , Mr Pal@@ mer said .
Two months after his election , the Elec@@ toral Commission officially stated that Mr Pal@@ mer won the seat of S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast de F@@ ai@@ r@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes , after re@@ counting .
Mr Pal@@ mer has put forward the idea of res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling the spo@@ ils system in order to speed up the process .
Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s d@@ augh@@ ters , Fr@@ ank and Bri@@ d@@ let .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over ?
“ We need a better system , ” he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your details in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6.@@ 30 a.m.
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of paper pen@@ s to mark the ballot papers .
Is it in order to be able to er@@ ase the result if anyone does not agree ?
Nowadays , having a piece of paper seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has studied the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years ago , said that his political project included an international airport for Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he would take his new office &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The public service is a public service exercise .
“ We are not seeking rewards , except for the reward of history because we must serve the community at a critical moment ’ , he added .
A bi@@ olog@@ ist team led by the Wil@@ d@@ life Society Society in New York identified a new dol@@ ph@@ in d@@ au@@ ph@@ in species off the northern coast of Australia .
Th@@ b@@ b@@ au@@ x B@@ of@@ ou@@ x , responsible for a scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre and the A@@ ni@@ ail@@ s and Mi@@ locations Mar@@ ins ( O@@ C@@ ES@@ M@@ M ) , comes back to the Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Is it surprising that this new type of dol@@ ph@@ in is to be discovered ?
That is good news , but I am not particularly surprised .
If , in the past , species have been described and identified on the basis of mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ at@@ om@@ ical and geographical basis , today , the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics allows us to improve our knowledge in the science of the classification of species .
Moreover , it is not impossible for these genetic and m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular progress to challenge the classification or membership of a species of a kind , a family , or even an order .
In the early nineteenth century , mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ists classified animals on the basis of moral differences between species .
Some of these ran@@ kings are now being called into question because of progress in genetic engineering .
Similarly , two species that are very close to mor@@ pho@@ logically have been distinguished from gene@@ tics .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
Ten years ago , the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-@@ family : the dol@@ ph@@ ins in the Pacific and the s@@ wing wh@@ ales of the Atlantic .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is this an important discovery , as the Wil@@ d@@ life Society Society said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic vari@@ ability .
If this population had already been known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , but only there .
Therefore , if a massive problem of death caused by a vir@@ al or acci@@ dental epidemic arises in the region , we could deal with the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widely spread on Earth .
This loss of genetic inher@@ it@@ ance would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered according to the number of existing people on Earth , that is , the stock , and the opportunity it has to recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to S@@ ous@@ a horse species , whose population of the new species has emerged , its stock automatically has become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ gene@@ ous , open habitats , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
Gen@@ e-@@ bre@@ wing limits the creation of new species .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which can eventually create new species .
We must bear in mind that the marine environment is the least well known .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts on M@@ ars , than to know what lives in the Mari@@ ann@@ e ’ s grave , just 11 kilome@@ ters from the sea surface .
More money is being spent on life research on other plan@@ ets than on marine research , and it is high time that this was changed .
R@@ B@@ S suspen@@ ds two traders in the currency market .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland has suspended two tra@@ pp@@ ers of its foreign-@@ exchange division on two sides of the dossier , yet again shows that the global investigation by regulators of suspic@@ ions of currency market manipul@@ ations is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world ’ s largest financial market investigations , where US $ 5.@@ 3 trillion changes every day .
The two traders are the first employees of R@@ B@@ S to be suspended in the context of broad@@ ening the investigation which echo@@ es the scandal of the manipulation of the inter@@ bank rate Li@@ b@@ or .
The bank , which refused to comment on the suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month having received requests for information from regulators .
&apos;@@ The ongoing investigation of this case continues and we cooperate fully with the F@@ C@@ A and the other regulators &apos; , said a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , the sources close to the dossier stated that R@@ B@@ S had passed on em@@ ail@@ s and in@@ stant messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , to the British regulator , the Financial Con@@ du@@ x@@ t Authority .
The R@@ ad@@ er , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 and would have been suspended from his post as the European Cred@@ it Tr@@ ust for J@@ P@@ Morgan .
R@@ h@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , a European official in C@@ ut@@ i exchange trading , was put off this week , while Mat@@ t Gar@@ d@@ in@@ er , senior currency tra@@ der in Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S , was suspended by Stand@@ ard Char@@ r@@ é this week .
None of these traders has been indic@@ ted .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s dossier included in@@ stant messages sent to and by bankers working at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ ti@@ group added sources close to the dossier .
U@@ B@@ S this week explained that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , declared that he was investigating suspic@@ ions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities – the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , the rule of Swiss competition authority , the F@@ C@@ F , the US Department of Justice , and Hong Kong ’ s monetary authority – look at the claims made about bankers who have agreed to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market . .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ Morgan and C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ é Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators , have indicated sources close to the file .
B@@ anks are sp@@ ur@@ ring the in@@ stant messages and em@@ ail@@ s sent for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
The news about these investigations has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth in investment trading units in recent years , but has been called into question this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers tried to play down the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast liquid exchange markets , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A sen@@ i@@ or tra@@ der said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “ explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market . L@@ it@@ tle expense . &apos;
The news came on the very day that C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland announced that it had sent a tra@@ der working in its fund office negotiated on the London stock exchange this week after it caused a $ 6 M loss at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators .
&apos;@@ We are convinced that the tra@@ der has acted alone and that the matter has been managed &apos; , a representative of the C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ is Switzerland .
The investigation of May@@ or Ro@@ b Ford has been bot@@ ched , a lawyer supported a lawyer .
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Ro@@ b Ford smo@@ k@@ est , M@@ e C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by argued that he had never seen such a bot@@ ched investigation .
M@@ e Ru@@ by said that he believes that the police had &quot; ignored or minim@@ ized &quot; evidence against the may@@ or .
On Thursday , the police arrested Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s occa@@ sional friend and driver , Alexander Lis@@ i , who was 35 years old , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion of the video .
Alexander Lis@@ i , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police have said that they have also observed this man delivering par@@ c@@ el to Ro@@ b Ford , indicating new court documents .
M@@ e Ru@@ by described as in@@ explic@@ able the fact that the police never sear@@ ched the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford or his home , or listened to his telephone , arguing that the chief police leader Bill Blair was informed of not acting against the may@@ or .
According to the law , the police , having witnessed suspected transactions in their own hands , could very well inter@@ cep@@ t the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford , arrest the may@@ or , and make a ra@@ id - even without a mandate .
It could also have requested a s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot mandate , if necessary .
The police chief did not comment , but his spokesman Mar@@ k P@@ u@@ gas described the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by as a &apos; obvious and desperate attempt &apos; to assert himself to the media in a case that does not concern him .
In the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &apos; reasonable grounds &apos; which could lead to the submission of a criminal accusation against the may@@ or .
European Bour@@ b@@ ons falling in mid-@@ sitting , except London
With the exception of London , Europe ’ s major stock markets are developing in mid-@@ sitting , pl@@ agu@@ ed by some news of disappointing companies , while W@@ all@@ -@@ Street is expected to rise .
Moreover , investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could un@@ settle its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
By contrast , after the announcement of 0.7 % inflation for the eurozone as a whole , the idea is spread among market participants that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
Future Wall Street ’ s future suggests that America ’ s actions will open up after two con@@ secu@@ tive re@@ tren@@ ch@@ ment sessions .
With regard to values , Rena@@ ult ( 4.@@ 63 % ) has the strongest withdrawal from CA@@ C 40 , which has been pl@@ agu@@ ed by the warning on the result of its partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor Friday .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( 6.@@ 26 % ) marks the worst performance of the Euro@@ st@@ 300 , after also publishing down@@ side results this morning and announced the internal creation of a dis@@ h@@ al structure of GBP 38 billion of the most risky assets . That is the case .
For its part , V@@ od@@ af@@ one ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) remains at the top of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 increases in response to press information that AT &amp; T study a possible takeover bid .
On the currency market , speculation about the ECB &apos;s monetary policy is going well , as John Har@@ dy , the strate@@ g@@ ist at Sa@@ x@@ o Bank , shows .
The ECB ’ s unique mandate has always been inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reason to act at next week ’ s meeting .
We are anticip@@ ating a strong reduction potential in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its withdrawal from the US currency and has reached a lower level of two weeks to 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 dollar .
The same con@@ jec@@ ture supports the eurozone ’ s bond market in the opposite direction .

Pol@@ lu@@ tion between Palestinians and Israelis on the border of Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday , 31 October 2013 at a violent h@@ all on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday 1 November after its fuel stocks had been exhausted , announced the Palestinian Authority &apos;s Energy Authority .
A local comm@@ ander from the A@@ zz@@ ed Al@@ -@@ Q@@ assa@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ade Bri@@ g@@ ades , K@@ hal@@ ed Abu B@@ ak@@ r , and another part of the Hamas army , R@@ ab@@ i@@ e@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a sh@@ r of t@@ ank during an Israeli army incur@@ sion into the Israeli army . is K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ ès , in the south of the Gaza Strip , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials of the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ assa@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ as@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ ou@@ d , died when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters led a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
An attack on a tunnel fu@@ elled by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli t@@ ank and a bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ er have incur@@ red a 100 me@@ tre incur@@ sion into the territory before leaving .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , a Hamas spokesman , Sam@@ i Abu Z@@ ou@@ ha@@ ri , paid tribute to the four “ her@@ oes ” and asser@@ ted that Israeli soldiers died during the confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of al-@@ As@@ sa@@ am who fell pre@@ y to the territory in an incur@@ sion of the Z@@ ion@@ ist occup@@ ier at K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ ès .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;@@ Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &apos; , has threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a broad tunnel wi@@ dened into Israeli territory from the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , discovered on 7 October and intended , according to the army , to &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed that tun@@ n@@ els were used to fight Israel , stating that the aim was to take away Israeli soldiers to trade them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation aimed to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communi@@ qu@@ é .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive gear targeting the Ta@@ h@@ al forces ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israel ’ s At@@ t@@ ack in Northern Syria
&apos;@@ This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians &apos; , as stated by the spokesman of the army Peter L@@ er@@ ner .
On the other hand , Israel has hit a military base in north-@@ west Syria for a ship@@ ment of missiles to Lebanese Hezbollah Hezbollah , on Thursday 31 October the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite channel .
An American official has confirmed a &apos; Israeli strike &apos; , but has not given details of the target .
&apos;@@ In the past , targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah &apos; , has simply added .
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
In the name of the &apos; exclusive sources &apos; that it has not appointed , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that &apos; the bombing targeted a cargo of solar missiles intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon &apos; , with reference to the powerful Shi@@ ite Shi@@ ite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .

He s@@ wor@@ n to the 18 court judges of the Court , whose building on the N@@ il was built to resemb@@ le an Egyptian temp@@ le .
“ We want better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , ” President Mor@@ si declared during the sole@@ mn ceremony broadcast directly on public television .
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” explained Mr Mor@@ si , a 60 year-old engine@@ er in the United States from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years from his training as an illegal and hard-@@ pressed organization . S@@ ucc@@ ess by successive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11 hours , local hours , followed by a small con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred f@@ ans had gathered before the Court to che@@ er the new president , and , dist@@ an@@ cing himself from the Mubarak years , the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage from his con@@ voy to the very crow@@ ded streets linking the town centre to the southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
The Muslim Brotherhood ’ s un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ rescue wheel , ” his personal prestige considerably strengthened since his victory and Friday speech during which he tried to port@@ ray himself as the candidate not only of Islamists , but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against him . authoritarian President Mubarak .
&apos;@@ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional and modern state &apos; , said Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , blue co@@ stu@@ me and red co@@ st@@ ate , addressing the judges present in the or@@ thodox bo@@ is@@ ter in which he s@@ wor@@ n .
Lat@@ er , Mor@@ si went to Cairo University , where he gave his inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture speech .
He was officially ho@@ sted by a military fan@@ fare that played the national an@@ them when he was standing in for you .
T@@ é@@ sh@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ ou@@ i attended the ceremony .
On his arrival he was gre@@ eted by the &apos; people and the army , hand in hand &apos; , with thousands of people gathered together in the great lec@@ ture of the university .
Based on 19@@ 08 and a former bas@@ tion of secular education , Cairo ’ s University of Cairo later became a str@@ ing of Islamic students ’ groups in the 1970 ’ s .
Mr Mor@@ si made a symbolic s@@ wor@@ n Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square , where the uprising that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian regime last year , and s@@ wor@@ n to recover presidential powers , whose military council , which replaced the former president , has deprived him of it .
But , by agreeing to lend formally to the Court , rather than to Parliament as usual , he is pr@@ one to the military ’ s will by showing that the power struggle is not over .
Mor@@ si ’ s speech in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gest@@ ures .

In a note to the bank &apos;s clients , he believes that this small bra@@ ke is primarily due to &apos; the government sh@@ ut@@ down and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month &apos; .

Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by sho@@ ts fired by two people who were on board a mo@@ to from the neo-@@ az@@ i D@@ aw@@ n D@@ aw@@ n sub@@ ur@@ b of Athens , was taught police .
The police were not in a position at the moment to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political aff@@ ili@@ ation .

Ex@@ pro@@ pe@@ ated against the Bar@@ ç@@ a for a blow to N@@ y@@ mar , the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three meetings by U@@ EF@@ A .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , his club said &apos; very disappointed &apos; , believing that his appeal was entirely justified .
Almost 50 000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province , shortly after l@@ un@@ ch@@ time Friday , due to the violent win@@ ds affecting many regions along the River St L@@ au@@ rent .

You thought that travel agents belong@@ ed to the past because of the Internet ?
F@@ light C@@ enter seems to be rever@@ sing the trend .
Society has revised its forecasts of net up@@ wards and hopes for record results thanks to ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expecting an underlying profit from the entire exercise of between $ 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 before taxes , against a previous forecast of $ 30@@ 5 to $ 3@@ 15 .
If the current forecasts are met , this will represent 12 to 17 % growth compared to $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 per figure reached in 2011 / 12 .
The Director-General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ light Centre had made 8 % profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom .
&quot; Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are well on the way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before deduc@@ ting interest and taxes &apos; , he said .
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits .
In Australia , the leisure tri@@ ps have been b@@ oun@@ ced back in the second half of the year , making it possible to compensate for a small reduction in a domestic market for business travel .
Similarly , in the UK , F@@ light travel tri@@ ps have performed well while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year , where seasonal demand was lower and benefited from the entire financial year for the third con@@ secu@@ tive time .

Un@@ know@@ ns of a ho@@ tel near the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid
On Friday , ho@@ o@@ ked in@@ know@@ ns opened fire on a ho@@ tel close to the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mi@@ ds in Egypt without causing victims , as a result of apparent qu@@ arre@@ l with redundant workers .
The att@@ ack@@ ers fled , specified the spokes@@ person of the Ministry of the Interior , the General General Ab@@ del L@@ ati@@ f .
This attack occurred when Egypt received almost no tourists since the military de@@ posed the Islamist President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si at the beginning of July and re@@ pressed his follow@@ ers ’ demonstrations .
Scho@@ ols are encouraged to focus more on mathema@@ tics , spe@@ eds , and g@@ ram@@ mar .
In English literature courses , pupils will have to study at least one piece of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic po@@ em and a contemporary British fic@@ tion of 19@@ 14 .
The review will also present &apos; new texts &apos; to encourage a more diverse reading .
A combination of literature and English language will be abolished .
From 2015 onwards , pupils will have to pass an independent language G@@ C@@ SE , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education will have to publish its new English and Ma@@ th@@ s programmes tomorrow – the first subjects to be subject to radical review .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the regulator regulator , will reveal a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of the structure of the S@@ C@@ SE , with a new system of rating and less prices .
Speaking in the summer , Mic@@ hael Go@@ ve , Education Minister , said that there was “ broad consensus as to the need to reform our exam@@ inations to restore public confidence , ” insisting that the C@@ SE would be “ more stimulating , more ambitious , and more rigorous . ” .
Stu@@ dies show that English schools devote less time to m@@ the@@ ms ( 1@@ 16 hours per year , 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
In comparison , Austr@@ ali@@ an schools offer an average of 14@@ 3 hours per year , while Singapore ’ s pupils make about 13@@ 8 hours .
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours on employment from time to time , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the C@@ SE of dee@@ pen@@ ed m@@ asks – as well as the greater importance of the issues in international ran@@ kings – would likely encourage schools to ensure more of more than they do . It is a long time .
The programme will place greater emphasis on the ‘ problems of the real world ’ , including financial mathema@@ tics .

Mü@@ ller did not survive at the end of the war .

This re@@ vel@@ ation , 68 years after the end of Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler ’ s Nazi regime , would respond to one of the great con@@ und@@ ru@@ m of the A@@ pr@@ u war .
The German secret services , the N@@ B@@ D , ensured that during the summer of 19@@ 49 Mü@@ ller was in Kar@@ lo@@ v@@ y V@@ y , then in Cz@@ echo@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ akia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
The secret services were totally wrong .
&apos;@@ From August 1945 , the body of Mü@@ ller was found in a temporary grave near the former minis@@ try of the Re@@ ich of the Re@@ ich by a comm@@ an@@ do &apos; , according to Mr T@@ uch@@ el .
He referred to &apos; a uniform of the general &apos; .
&quot; In the left wing , in particular , was his service states with a photo@@ grap@@ h &quot; , he continued .
It also published a document of the town council of the Mit@@ te district in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood of the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
The president of the Central Council of Germany ’ s Jews , Di@@ ter Gr@@ au@@ mann , declared himself shocked by this re@@ vel@@ ation .
Whether one of the most brutal Nazi sad@@ es is buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery , it is a huge enorm@@ ity of bad taste .

T@@ ell us what you think of it in the comments .
It is working in the mu@@ d , the jung@@ le and going through rivers to offer free medical assistance free of charge .
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le dis@@ covers free health care in Cam@@ ero@@ on ’ s villages in Cam@@ ero@@ on ’ s villages .
D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend on hundreds of patients with hundreds of patients .
There are not many doctors in this country of West Africa , barely 1 to 5 000 inhabitants .
Vo@@ te here or your mobile machinery
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le is one of the 10 H@@ é@@ os C@@ N@@ N in 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the 10 other her@@ oes , for him to elect him &apos; H@@ ér@@ os C@@ N@@ N of the year &apos; .
This person will receive $ 25@@ 0@@ ,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le watched his father ill alter@@ n@@ ating periods of conscience and reck@@ lessness , and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James B@@ w@@ el@@ le was injured in a car accident near Y@@ a@@ un@@ é , Cam@@ ero@@ on ’ s capital .
At the beginning , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted an infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ em@@ at@@ om@@ a whose legacy he was going to wear the rest of his life .
“ There were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in Cam@@ ero@@ on , ” Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le said .
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money .
Instead , Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le spent years supporting his father in crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , so that he would get any treatment he could receive .
&quot; It is not easy , &quot; adds Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
You can leave the house at 5 p.m. , you can get to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they wait too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there are only 1 doctors for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
Even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ ons would not be able to pay for the consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of the country &apos;s health spending is carried out in the private sector .
“ The only problem they have , that is poverty , ” explained D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
And because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
Having seen his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ riots suffer , Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le was determined to try to change things .
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his team of volunteers have carried out more than 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the last year .
He became a doctor himself , working like sur@@ ge@@ ons to the Y@@ a@@ ound@@ é central hospital .
And he created a non-@@ profit@@ -making humanitarian association , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ M@@ E , which travel@@ s to rural areas during week@@ ends to provide free health care .
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32 000 people .
Almost every Friday , with 30 people , they are bo@@ gged down in fo@@ d@@ der after setting medical equipment on the ro@@ of and going through difficult areas to travel to the villages most in need .
It does not always follow them .
Time and time again , they have had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or pi@@ ous paths .
But when they arrive , they are received as her@@ oes : the community is organising a f@@ es@@ ti@@ val , d@@ an@@ cing and d@@ ance and offering them the best housing available .
In these villages , free healthcare is a good reason to celebrate , and Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le – with his great s@@ mile and sp@@ il@@ lo@@ ver energy – is more than happy to join the f@@ es@@ tivities .
The morning after , the team starts to receive hundreds of patients .
&apos;@@ We get 500 people on each visit &apos; , said Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
Sometimes they live 60 km of the village , and they come on foot .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is provided .
Many people are treated against malaria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive cru@@ t@@ ches , gl@@ asses of collected gl@@ asses , or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
T@@ on@@ ight , the practical team of simple sur@@ ge@@ ons under local an@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
Oper@@ ations are usually carried out in a school , a town ma@@ ker or a house ; after the intervention the patient is standing up and going into the aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the light of the elec@@ tro@@ gen group , the operation room and ster@@ il@@ isation of equipment , Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
This is a res@@ ounding r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , but village mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans generally help the team to remain motivated .
Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le explained Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le , &apos; They are kno@@ cking on the dr@@ ums all night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work &apos; .
On Sunday , the team returned to town , tired but proud of the work that it has done .
The group , made up of Cam@@ ero@@ on and medical students , carried out 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the last year , and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those who help them .
A man explained that the free operation he had experienced to treat a her@@ d would enable him to work again .
&apos;@@ This will change my future and that of my family &apos; , has said the man .
In addition to making this hospital travelling and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on , Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le is also working at night in private medical firms around Y@@ a@@ un@@ é .
It is this second job , he explained , which funds 60 % of his association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
“ I don ’ t know when he is sle@@ eping , ” a medical student said in the second year of D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a and volunte@@ er in Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le ’ s group .
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
For medical students and nurses like K@@ diplomacy O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le in his duties , this is an opportunity for learning on the ground that they do not have at home .
“ We were able to take part in operations to help the blood or use of the instruments to D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le . ” M@@ iss O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley explained .
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year .
Volun@@ tary students usually pay their travel to Cam@@ ero@@ on , often with medical equipment collected .
But once in Y@@ a@@ un@@ é , their pensions , transport and education are dealt with by Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
&apos;@@ He is a her@@ o , there is no doubt &apos; , he said K@@ diplomacy O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the Cam@@ ero@@ on people is not close to extinc@@ tion .
For Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ ping others to live happily in keeping with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him a great deal of joy .
&quot; I am so happy when I am doing this work , &quot; added Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
And I am thinking of my father .
I hope he can see what I am doing .
Making people lau@@ gh and reli@@ eving the pain are the reasons for me to do that .

The two France of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a
Per@@ ple@@ x aca@@ demics have long been pain@@ less to define and sit@@ u@@ ate Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a .
Professor in amp@@ hi@@ hi@@ ps and the lec@@ ture rooms ?
Un@@ doub@@ tedly , but by under@@ lining its weak point , S@@ ci@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , the E@@ u@@ d High Representative .
How many others &apos; works of work in the G@@ as@@ ton@@ -@@ G@@ al@@ mar@@ d street office ?
Indeed , but ignoring the hidden work and the black writing of the publ@@ ish@@ er .
H@@ er@@ tier of the occupied , Fon@@ taine@@ b@@ lea@@ f at the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t could not replace the true ho@@ ly oil , the theory of which it happened .
They will@@ ingly acknowledged in him a great wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th , an anim@@ ator and a feder@@ ator of their work , but to point out that he was not inclined to produce him himself .
To this uncertain image , the monu@@ ment of the Li@@ v@@ ory Li@@ ves , to which he attached his name , has also contributed .
The bad languages were able to see a huge market in chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with an enormous gl@@ ance and a le@@ et@@ ings of schol@@ ar@@ ship , but incur@@ ably dil@@ et@@ ted .
The two books published by Nor@@ a almost two years ago have already established that the person who did not write had long and well written .
The book here should definitely be justice for him .
Yet , once again , there is the temptation of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , intellectual v@@ ag@@ abund@@ ance , ju@@ bil@@ ation and ju@@ bil@@ ation to be j@@ um@@ ped together on one subject to another .
But it is easy to understand that the dispar@@ ate objects brought together in this book to such a beautiful title bring the bu@@ c@@ ket to one and the same passion : that of finding out the constituent &apos;s constituent of French identity .
Why these dramatic calls to national unity ?
I@@ d@@ enti@@ fied : it is a concern of the time .
Only a short time ago , we were collectively invited to give it a definition .
But , in the per@@ va@@ sive spirit of our then leaders , French identity was a g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine .
It was only by deplo@@ ying accidents , and the case , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism required , was entrusted to the pre@@ fec@@ ts and sub@@ pre@@ fec@@ ts , authorised interpreters .
Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a tr@@ ump Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a is quite different .
It does not arise as an e@@ ternal he@@ ir , it refuses to define it .
An@@ aly@@ st for a familiar str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he is w@@ an@@ dering into a forest of symbols , arrested each step by a bus form , tor@@ mented by irrit@@ ating questions .
He is born , who is born of the company itself : why , in a country that is so long established within its borders , so formerly char@@ ted and firmly mature , will these dramatic calls be made to unity ?
They are so pressing , suggested by Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , to avoid the distur@@ b@@ ance of dis@@ cor@@ d in French history .
Fran@@ cs and G@@ au@@ laws , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ac@@ s and Bour@@ gu@@ ers , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the forces of division here are very old .
And the most symbolic is , of course , the one that f@@ lies in the face of national history .
From the earthquake ’ s earthquake , the French have two stories , and they have two nations , a mon@@ arch@@ ic , and the other revolutionary .
The second wanted the first , but it did not deny it ; instead , it was anxious to return to the sac@@ red and all the more gre@@ edy for unity and indi@@ visibility that it had cut the head off from the obvious and powerful embo@@ di@@ ment .
And , hence , an inv@@ inci@@ bly bin@@ ary nation , shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism , and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , wor@@ ship and hatred .
In order to make France ’ s identity felt , there is nothing worth the four steps outside the H@@ exagger@@ one , so the American si@@ ck@@ ness of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a may well be the heart of his book .
After all , America and France have a revolution , they have drawn up a declaration of rights , they want to establish a new society .
But the American c@@ ous@@ ing is only more empha@@ tic about what is unique to us .
There , men who left their An@@ ci@@ en region in England and did not need to worry about it .
Here , j@@ ge@@ sted men of an an@@ ci@@ en region of India , and all the more radical .
This is a consensu@@ al revolution when it s@@ owed drama and confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation into it .
There , the founding fathers who are still hon@@ ored , and here , revolutionary anc@@ estors whose models are struggling to models , and who have , of course , killed themselves .
Here institutional consistency , and here there is a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitutions , such as errors of catching up and tests to be carried out .
France , which is now France ,
Yet there was a time when the French believed that they could rec@@ ou@@ p the te@@ eth of their history , and defeat the figure two .
With Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a ’ s central and creative Republic , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a showed a great deal of interest and ten@@ acity : sal@@ u@@ ting those who then used to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching children to school children everything that in former France was preparing modern France and proposing them to them . A unified version of their history .
But this peaceful identity has only had time .

The book therefore offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ it of France and the circum@@ spec@@ tion of France .
With , on top of this , the portra@@ it of the histor@@ ian , who should set aside some sur@@ prises .
It is discovered that the railway was a cat@@ er .
The man of multiple cu@@ ri@@ o@@ si@@ ties turned , slightly obs@@ es@@ sively , around the same idea .
The man@@ ual of man@@ power is at the centre of the centre .
And those who tabled , over half a century ago , a subject on the idea of nation , but took away from the initial exercise of the thesis , entr@@ ust us with , cu@@ m fat , that he will end up doing so .
Of course , in a less sophisticated , fragmented and sub@@ tle form .
Let us not dec@@ eive ourselves , however .
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curricul@@ um , this is an indication of the internal need for a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &apos; The return is quite complex enough to manage &apos; .
Ra@@ ised in Be@@ ir@@ ut on 8 March 1986 , together with three members of his “ An@@ ten@@ ne 2 ” team , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ di@@ in was released almost 21 months later on November 27 , 1987 .
Re@@ treaty since 2008 has participated in the creation in 2004 of the creation of the F@@ T@@ As to defend the world ’ s hostages , which he has presid@@ ed over for several years .
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to lo@@ dge a complaint and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages in A@@ q@@ i ( al-@@ Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) Dan@@ i@@ el L@@ arre@@ be , Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry D@@ ol , Pi@@ er@@ re Le@@ great and Mar@@ c F@@ é@@ re@@ t were released on Tuesday .
After medical exam@@ inations at the V@@ al-@@ D@@ -@@ de Military Ho@@ sp@@ ital , they have , since then , been able to return to their families .
And , gradually , try to take the course of their lives again .
&apos;@@ The New Ob@@ ser@@ ver &apos; asked Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ di@@ in , 62 years , ex grand delay , which has been re@@ treated since 2008 , President of the World Trade Organisation .
As early as the evening of your release , you were on the 20@@ h of &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
There , in particular , in Be@@ ir@@ ut .
When I was released , I found myself in the co@@ ff@@ in of a car where I met - without seeing it because it is black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ que .
He tells me &apos; we are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and I am told that we can still be killed .
We are very exc@@ ited , but also very tense .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They are putting us on the edge of a pa@@ vements .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then we come to the Sum@@ mer@@ land ho@@ tel where the press is present .
The French have brought us to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
This is the time for parents , family , friends and press ...
I remember taking a b@@ ath for an hour .
And having d@@ ine in T@@ -@@ shir@@ t to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
I also remember a short night to discuss with Ro@@ ger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
T@@ en@@ sions are still there because we do not have the means to evac@@ u@@ ate to Lar@@ n@@ ac@@ a Air@@ port in Cyprus .
Ar@@ ri@@ ved there with hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , one takes a private aeroplan@@ e who brings us back to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ ren@@ z@@ ara , where P@@ as@@ qua is .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
We are at@@ taining Or@@ ly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
This is a little brutal .
There is an un@@ believ@@ able but@@ ster .
And there is a lot of media .
When I left there were three television channels .
I have come back and I have full .
The des@@ cent from the aeroplan@@ e ra@@ id , the re@@ union with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely emotional .
Between the airport and in my home , many motor@@ cycles follow our car that R@@ cus@@ i is driving .
The motor@@ ists get the tor@@ ch for photo@@ graph@@ s and go to me to me where I have to police some of the police to prevent some of them from rising .
The media pressure is enormous .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and ti@@ red@@ ness is such that it is difficult to see .
We are running out of a hole and we are suddenly under media fire .
It is a little complicated , rather violent , rather complex to manage .
But the hardest thing has been done .
The on@@ set , I am at the 20@@ h , the next day , too , I am on television .
Then there is a kind of adjustment to life , very slowly , for one or two months that is a little like holiday .
How did the medical exam@@ inations and the D@@ G@@ SE deal have gone ?
I had the first medical control in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The rest was done in the V@@ al-@@ de-@@ sa@@ iling day following my return : radi@@ os , all kinds of exam@@ s and a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that you can count on him , if need be , that we are not handed over to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I have also met the intelligence services .
They asked me about the hostage ta@@ kers .
That was logical .
It did not bo@@ de well for me .
How do you respond today to the release of the four hostages in Ni@@ ger ?
I listen to what is being said .
The debate on r@@ ans@@ oms in particular .
Some things irrit@@ ate me , others less .
I am trying to take stock between the issues on my past as a hostage and my h@@ at as President of the World Trade Organisation , which allows me to distance myself from this , and seems to me to be much more interesting to address .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Above all , I am fighting , together with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostages .
In my opinion , there is a problem of sem@@ an@@ tics .
We must call the capture of &apos; political hostages &apos; &apos; political hostages &apos; - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice , to lo@@ dge complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in sympathy , emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice ?
A tribunal in The Hague is for that .
Why do you not say to the hostage ta@@ kers , &apos; You have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of war , like those of all the Geneva Conventions , you will be brought to justice &apos; ?
It seems to me to be founded , however legitimate , on common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and it is shocking to me .
That is my main struggle .
Egyptian Islamists ’ street in the streets to denounce Mor@@ si ’ s trial
An@@ aly@@ sis is gr@@ ub@@ bing up within the ranks of Egypt ’ s Islamists .
Two days before the trial of the de@@ posed President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
A mobili@@ zation throughout Egypt to demand the re-@@ establishment of the country ’ s first democratically elected president .
It is not a trial that highlights the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s activis@@ t .
Until now , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to make a copy of the documents of the case .
It is not a trial , it is a far@@ ce .
The trial of President Mor@@ si is a false trial of pro-@@ Mor@@ si , he is supposed to make S@@ is@@ i judge , not the other way round .
Mor@@ si is to judge S@@ is@@ i for the massacres in Ra@@ ab@@ a@@ a , the N@@ ah@@ da massacres , and the massacre of the Republican Gu@@ ard .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
clashes broke out in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police used te@@ ar gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police officers will be deployed to the police ac@@ ade@@ my in Cairo , where Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si will be tried .
H@@ ag@@ el repro@@ aching 9 American states for violating homosexual rights
E@@ ver since the federal state recognized sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage , &quot; All military spouses have a right to an identity card for the Department of Defense and benefits that come with &quot; , reminded the Minister in New York in a speech to the An@@ cient Defense League against anti-Semitism .
&apos;@@ But some states refuse to issue these cards to sa@@ me-@@ sex spouses in the National Gu@@ ards &apos; installations , which he denounced , accused these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases , or access them to their shops .
The Secretary of Defense said that he ordered the National Gu@@ ard leader , Fr@@ ank Gr@@ ass , to ensure that federal law was implemented .
The front of the nine states began with T@@ ex@@ as , which refuses to implement these benefits on the establishment of the T@@ ex@@ an National Gu@@ ard , because of a conflict between the text of the text and the federal law on sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage .
It was joined in its refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ ppi , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Car@@ ol@@ ine and Western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defence officer .

A case of ra@@ b@@ ies detected in a c@@ at in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise
On Thursday , 31 October , the authorities announced that a case of ra@@ b@@ ies had been detected in a ch@@ at@@ on in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise , which was obviously foreign to France since 2001 .
The Ch@@ at@@ on was found on October 25 in Ar@@ g@@ ment@@ il and died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of ra@@ b@@ ies was confirmed by the Pa@@ ste@@ ur Institute .
&apos;@@ epide@@ mi@@ ological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of those people who could have come into contact with this ch@@ at@@ us between 8 October and 28 October included &apos; precise &apos; ministries of health and agriculture &apos; .
&apos;@@ Five people who have been in contact with the ch@@ at@@ on have already been identified &apos; and have received preventive treatment .
&apos;@@ C@@ ome on man , the preventive treatment of human ra@@ b@@ ies , administered after contact with the animal , but before symptoms appear , is very effective &apos; , precisely the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The ministries are now calling on those who would have been dead , gri@@ pped , re@@ bu@@ ff@@ ed , or l@@ acked on a mu@@ qu@@ et or skin injured by this ch@@ at@@ on or whose animal had been in contact with that ch@@ at@@ us between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0@@ 8@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ th . 0.@@ 0@@ 6@@ 0.@@ 95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November .

Obama ’ s He@@ al@@ th@@ care Reform
Under a a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday to his un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable and often repeated promise that “ if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep him . ”
After hundreds of thousands of people received withdrawal opinions from their providers , the Republic@@ ans criticised the President over the last few days by acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
“ The vast majority of people with health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
Speaking of what he calls “ topical and urgent ” re@@ tren@@ ch@@ ment , President Obama has pushed Americans to seek new market insurance .
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive health systems that are better suited for the same price , or even cheaper than anticipated .
“ You will get out of it , ” he said .
The Administration announced that it would be surprising if the 5 % of the population who themselves contr@@ acted their insurance were forced to change regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act .
‘ Let me address these Americans directly : you deserve better ’ , said K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us during his testi@@ mony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who over@@ sees the implementation of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act , indicated that the launch in October of the online market had failed &apos; mis@@ erably &apos; .
“ I am as frustrated and irrit@@ ated as anyone else , ” she added .
I look forward to reg@@ ain@@ ing your confidence .
He was a K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated when she believed her micro@@ phone was cut off , addressing an assist@@ ant sitting behind her at yesterday &apos;s sitting of the Assembly following a contentious exchange of views with B@@ ill@@ y L@@ ong , Republican representative from the M@@ iss@@ our@@ i M@@ iss@@ our@@ i ( M@@ iss@@ our@@ i ) is to know whether she should join Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
For more than three hours , B@@ ill@@ y L@@ ong repeatedly urged Mrs S@@ be@@ li@@ us why &apos; the architec@@ t &apos; of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act had not voluntarily given up on government insurance to take on a regime via He@@ al@@ th@@ Car@@ e@@ .@@ go@@ v than it was . Now we are talking to millions of Americans .

The German S@@ bas@@ ti@@ an V@@ et@@ t@@ tel , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ ple For@@ mul@@ a 1 champion , cap@@ tured for the free trials of the Gr@@ and Pri@@ x of Abu D@@ h@@ ab@@ i on Friday , a special cas@@ que whose design was achieved by a 21 year-old Mexican f@@ an .
V@@ et@@ tel chose among 1 500 car@@ to@@ ons sent from all over the world , within the framework of a competition launched by one of the spons@@ ors , a motor vehicle , of its stable .
He was invited to follow Abu D@@ hab@@ i ’ s G@@ P with a friend , so he can see the German champion , the run@@ way , and his stan@@ d closely .
It was to wear this hel@@ m on Friday and Saturday , on the trial .
It is likely that he will have another special ca@@ p on Sunday for the race to mark his fourth con@@ secu@@ tive global title .
One inhabit@@ ant of Au@@ ber@@ vit@@ a laun@@ ches his sub@@ ur@@ b ’ s party of the sub@@ ur@@ b .
Let us not dec@@ eive ourselves .
In the spirit of Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ e , his foun@@ der , the sub@@ ur@@ b of the sub@@ ur@@ b , is directed not only at ban@@ li@@ ans .
I have chosen a map of France as a lo@@ go , he justifies it .
When I speak of sub@@ ur@@ bs , I address all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , his draft , presented on Thursday at the press conference in its municip@@ ality of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ ol , was born out of the desire to better defend multicul@@ tur@@ alism , this great cultural po@@ t that character@@ ises the neighbour@@ hoods above all .
My proposal No 1 is to set up a Ministry of multicul@@ tur@@ alism , he says .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , 50 years of territorial att@@ ach@@ é , is now claiming to be “ 100 % a@@ political , ” even if he has not always been neutral .
Mi@@ xed in 2002 , together with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ é@@ nez , he then supported Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in locally between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the equality values that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if the right wing people are prepared to support me , I will also listen to them .
All I am talking about is the extremist parties .
In addition to multicul@@ tur@@ alism , Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ e built its consul@@ tancy programme on Inter@@ net@@ - from many issues that are supposed to talk to sub@@ ur@@ bs and especially young people : the right to vote for foreigners , the leg@@ alisation of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , the civilian majority at 16 . The rehabilitation of the function of custo@@ di@@ ans ...
We need to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene &apos; .@@ For the 2014 municipal elections , it is likely to be fair , he recognises &apos; .
It is a problem of time and money .
The sub@@ ur@@ bs of the sub@@ ur@@ b of the sub@@ ur@@ b should , after all , be represented by my candi@@ d@@ acy , and I hope in other cities too .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ e already provides seven heads of list in me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an France and Mart@@ ini@@ que .
&quot; And the support that I receive since yesterday does not all come from sub@@ ur@@ bs of a sub@@ ur@@ b &apos; .
John Ker@@ ry admitted without precedent that America &apos;s es@@ pion@@ age &quot; went too far too far &apos; .
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ tening of America &apos;s defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by ad@@ mitting , without precedent , that on several occasions es@@ pion@@ age “ has gone too far . ”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , had governed on “ automatic pilot ” when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations by whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about N@@ SA ’ s sp@@ ying activities came into being .
The lea@@ ks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
When Mr Ker@@ ry spoke at an intergovernmental conference in London , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &apos; There is no doubt that the President , myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things as an automatic pilot because we had the opportunity to do so from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War and then to the difficult years of the Cold War . Of course , on September 11 . ”
Then he became the first high-@@ ranking member of the US government to admit that American es@@ pion@@ age had over@@ run , but insisted that everyone ’ s rights had not been violated .
He said : ‘ In some cases it has gone too far . ’
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels dec@@ eived .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : ‘ We live in a new world in which people are ready to be saved ’ .
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , to blow them up and to attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they took action ?
We have actually prevented aircraft from falling , buildings to explo@@ de and people to be murdered because we have been able to read the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about suspected American es@@ pion@@ age and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the US , on Thursday explained the President of the Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut said that he spoke to Members of the European Parliament and others this week , and that he was concerned about the threats they had made about the possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the sense of frustration generated by the surveillance of the National Security Committee . S@@ ucc@@ ess .
&apos;@@ It really is important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the fight against terrorism &apos; , has declared Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first term of office , and President of the European Senate &apos;s Sub@@ committee on European Affairs in an interview since Washington .
And I am going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by N@@ SA programmes .
The press reports that the N@@ SA cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which damaged relations with some US allies , but this week the agency director declared that it was in@@ accurate and that it was a misunderstanding , because it was about meta@@ data that NATO allies had gathered and had collected . shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations reported documents lea@@ ked by S@@ now@@ den that the N@@ SA had inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phones and 34 other heads of state .
The director of the intelligence services , James C@@ lar@@ er , justified sp@@ ying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was standard practice on both sides .
In this atmosphere of tu@@ mul@@ t , Mur@@ ph@@ y indicated that his office was holding a Congress trip , which is due to take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and cham@@ bers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be un@@ ve@@ iled in the coming days .
He said that the route was still to be defined .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the purpose of this journey was to make it possible for relations to be improved , but also to be &apos; affec@@ tion@@ ate firm@@ ness &apos; .
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of es@@ pion@@ age programmes they have been applying for years .
&apos;@@ We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to es@@ pion@@ age &apos; , has said Mur@@ ph@@ y .
Meanwhile , Ker@@ ry plans to go to the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to manage the resen@@ tment en@@ gen@@ dered by US strategies in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .

An Austr@@ ali@@ an appeal for his prison sentence in Thailand .
A 21 year-old Sy@@ d@@ ney who was sentenced to 15 days in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et for allegedly being attacked by a tax@@ i driver , who wrongly claimed to have been attacked by a tax@@ i driver , was released on b@@ ail .
Ste@@ vi@@ e Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first found guilty by a P@@ hu@@ k@@ let P@@ hu@@ k@@ let Court of Pro@@ v@@ ince on 15 June when he told the Tha@@ i police that a local tax@@ i driver , accompanied by two other men , had attacked him early on Sunday 10 June . .
However , video record@@ ings later revealed that it was returned to its ho@@ tel safely after being separated from its Austr@@ ali@@ an small friend .
P@@ hu@@ k@@ let police inter@@ rog@@ ated B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she admitted that she had invented history .
She was held in a local office of office before the hearing before the court .
B@@ am@@ ford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-@@ security detention centre on the periphery of P@@ hu@@ k@@ let rather than in a women &apos;s prison .
This is the daughter of the former Austr@@ ali@@ an player ru@@ g@@ by , Peter Tun@@ ks , who appe@@ aled to the Can@@ ber@@ ra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told the Sunday Te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h de Sy@@ d@@ ney that the entire family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia .
‘ We have , of course , experienced a dist@@ ressing moment , but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible ’ , according to Tun@@ ks .
B@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled and was released after a deposit of 50 000 b@@ ates was paid .
In Australia , the press said that , in the meantime , it was on holiday in the K@@ ra@@ bi region , south of Thailand .
Tha@@ i legal sources indicated that B@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local lawyer in P@@ hu@@ k@@ let , but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the penalty of up to two years imprisonment and imprisonment in adult prison .
But , after the recent murder in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et of Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith , an Austr@@ ali@@ an travel@@ ler , Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorating image with tourists , which could lead to a acqu@@ it@@ tal .

In the school curricul@@ um Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ y@@ s , 62 % of pupils have a mother tongue other than French .
A year ago , this was the reason for consultation with parents , pupils , teachers and members of the education staff , to think about how to better integrate pupils who live between different cultures .
