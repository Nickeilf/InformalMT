I had only one piece of work , in a thri@@ f@@ ty , that I had to accept and order for the staff , that almost all of the time was being put to me and I was not entitled to stop ( even after having to work 6-@@ 7 hours of the dec@@ e@@ it@@ er ) before I had finished all the comm@@ issions . Re@@ ports and deli@@ veries .
At the beginning was co@@ ol but hard , I was glad to do something else for once that stay at home , as well as the money , and that was why sport was all the less ben@@ i@@ gn .
When one of my colleagues with whom I worked and who I was working with , what would I say ?
It was wrong to get your foot to make the orders .
He and I have never been heard , despite my multiple attempts ( to share out the tasks ) .
At the end of the day , there were a number of orders , and we also had to take stock of the fri@@ dge , so I say to him that I agree to take stock of the fri@@ dge if he does the rest .
It is in agreement .
I will end the work and go home .
Next Monday , I am called upon to say that there is a big problem that the orders which have been made have not been made .
They are that my colleague had &apos; forgotten &apos; to do his job except that , instead of ad@@ mitting it , he was guilty of blam@@ ing me , I at the beginning did not understand what was going on . I was asked to go and do it in a topical and urgent debate in 15 minutes .
Then I was told in ro@@ yal cal@@ m@@ ness that everything was my fault and I am made redundant .
I am not particularly trying to fight ( the ho@@ tel was in court ) , I had a plane ticket in 1 months to break off the island for six months , so it was going a little further and left me time to move .
However , I still have this betra@@ yal of this t@@ reason , and for an initial working experience it really is no longer complete .

Mr B@@ ah , not because , once again , you deliberately ignored the whole historical background , that is to say , a few millen@@ nia ago of the injustice of men / women and a culture that is still mach@@ o .
You can not make a law , a rule , without context .
Making a &apos; white &apos; square is the same , you would forget a few centuries of slave labour .
In fact , it is not biased , it is dis@@ honest , because you deliberately refuse to take into account the reality of today &apos;s society and its historical foundations , because they do not support your reasoning .
And you are unaware of the whole historical background of segreg@@ ation between men and women in favour of segreg@@ ation as the only solution to the problem we are talking about .
And are you going to be extra@@ pol@@ ating to me ?
S@@ ay@@ ing out completely the other solutions , by pre@@ tending to es@@ p@@ ouse this one , because the situation makes it necessary .
But on an application that knows the identity of all the speakers , who can know their position , which notes , who receives comments from customers , etc .
Do you really believe that segreg@@ ation really is no solution ?
And when I propose the wearing of weapons , you claim not to oppose it for ideological reasons , as I am against segreg@@ ation for ideological reasons , but because it is prohibited .
However , sexual discrimination is also prohibited .
G@@ g@@ t@@ ; Al@@ go , let us be ins@@ ane , propose .
Because , if you stop telling us on this tic@@ k box , the solution is that B@@ la@@ B@@ la@@ in is offering the same to men , which will serve as a d@@ ull and will not make any progress at all , but will solve your problem .
This is an indication that you do not read mine .
I do not want a man &apos; s box .
I do not want discrimination .
As N@@ elson Man@@ de@@ la did not want the black against white people , he wanted an end to racism .
You think so little by little that you do not realise that we can defend individuals .
It is not for fear of off@@ ending men that I am against , it is because of fear of off@@ ending everyone .
Im@@ proving gender discrimination in the two sense , prejudices , c@@ lic@@ h@@ és , cultural differences that explain differences in access to power .
So if it is , if it is , a &apos; U@@ ber femin@@ ine &apos; , as it stands , could perhaps make a fur@@ y ( said : unfortunately , because not , basically , I am too much for this kind of thing , I was just saying that the simple fact that this measure is taken shows that it is a fact that this measure is being taken . The basic problem is real .
A@@ h bin the demo@@ s , which is bound to be there .
Gender c@@ lic@@ h@@ és have per@@ me@@ ated society so much .
You know that there would probably also be strong demand for female doctors for women , for women &apos;s sports rooms , for c@@ af@@ és reserved for women , for women &apos;s shops , etc .

That the judge can already ordered pre-emp@@ tive arrests if evidence of g@@ ang violence is provided , such as a Fac@@ e@@ book call , thanks to the entire arsen@@ al of the state of emergency that has integrated into the law .
So what is the need for this new , extremely liber@@ tici@@ dal , authoritarian and dictatorial law to stop the perpetrators ?
When such a law hin@@ ders the freedom to demonstrate without order of a judge , when proceedings can only be exercised with the assistance of a lawyer after the event , so that a judge ass@@ esses the correc@@ tness of the measure , that this appeal can last for years with the presum@@ ption of guilt in the meantime , When such a law ha@@ mp@@ ers individual freedoms , who can support it ?

It is said to me if you find somewhere an effective political entity that is in less than two months &apos; time .
You are turning the matter into a reality .
I did not ask for a political movement .
Just that they learn to demonstrate in law , without causing s@@ cra@@ p , that they learn to clean up their r@@ allies that mud@@ dy their message .
If you really want to talk about a political movement , even though I do not want to make them a pu@@ b , we have to recognise that they have been moving quickly .
All the more so because of the reasons for the policies , it was my explanation , it was a movement which was created in the de@@ fi@@ ance of representation .
We are re@@ ap@@ ing the will of our political classes to restrict democracy to the vote .
There is no such thing as representation as a result of current policies .
It goes back much further and it is difficult for a country to turn its back on the size of France .
Above all , the continuation of the traditional functioning of the Fifth Republic was favoured by the majority of French people who had the opportunity to vote for a candidate who proposed an opening towards a 6@@ th Republic with fewer representation , professional assemb@@ lies , ... ( not perfect , but the least worst candidates in my opinion ) .
No if you are still in the same system ( of mer@@ chan@@ ts , we agree ) it is because of the choice of the people .
It is a pu@@ er@@ ile thing to put the blame on the policies .
Where , then , do I have to explain why rather than accuse me .
The forces of law and order must respect a gradu@@ ated response and not target their heads .
We agree on that , and there are some bad things in the police that may have done so .
However , I sincerely believe that , in such a confusion , you can find the upper part of someone &apos;s body without having targeted this place .
It is true that there will be la@@ is@@ se@@ z-@@ pass@@ ers and that is not normal .
The work of the police is also about protecting the population , including the one that is obvious .
Can it really protect the C@@ J@@ G@@ s if demonstrations are not declared ?
Is it what they are giving them the means to do the work they are asking for ?
Is there not a certain degree of complac@@ ency about the thu@@ gs and a willingness to break with the forces of law and order with the forces of law and order ?

I can only specul@@ ate about its real motives .
They try to get away from tra@@ gically losing one or other loved ones and seeing pictures of them in a fic@@ tion work .
Not a reconstruction of so-called events to the new , not a docu@@ mentary , not a film on the subject , but a completely de@@ t@@ ached tru@@ c .
People who give psychological and moral support to survi@@ v@@ ors always advise against news ballot papers for several weeks .
There are too great events to prevent them , as 11 September mentioned earlier .
The families of the victims of 9 / 11 did not look at F@@ light 93 , or the French docu@@ mentary on the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , the film with Ni@@ c C@@ age , etc .
But if the pictures of the tow@@ ers were used in a film on apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se , they would be right to feel scor@@ ned or insul@@ ted .
In the case of Bir@@ d Bo@@ x , it is a sequ@@ ence of what , barely two seconds , and still ?
But it is a bad thing for someone who has lost his family in a mon@@ ster accident and is trying to dis@@ tract himself from a sound horror of horror , so that in the middle of the film he re@@ sto@@ res the explosion that he made his wife or children or friends ...
The problem is that la@@ z@@ iness in fic@@ tion makes gest@@ ures in@@ sensitive to their producers .
It is not obvious to make an explosion of this intensity and it costs an arm .
Why not take proper action ?
Perhaps Ben , perhaps , “ because people died &quot; could weigh a little more .
No , clearly .
To say that it is , above all , popular among the far-@@ right nationalist parties .
What , like other parties , is for a bra@@ ke ?
And then these two years have shown at least the difficulty of negotiating agreements of 1 versus 27 .

At the same time , being in Barcelona does not mean heat the whole year .
It is a port town , after all .
( The me@@ c of my on@@ c@@ le lives in an old building , in the Barcelona centre , ther@@ mal insul@@ ation is w@@ ashed away , too , in winter and probably shares pain ) .
I would like to turn my attention to the matter .
I am interested in what people do not think .
I think it is legitimate to have a fear of the immigration of people from other continents with other cultures and to see the world .
It is even natural to see this as wild bus@@ h@@ es , and it is a completely human reaction to preserve it .
What is not as you are or is familiar with a fear gives rise to a fear , a cu@@ ri@@ osity that is being rejected .
Especially when he can see some of the immigration problems ( the examples he provides ) in a way .
I think it is legitimate for a population to have concerns about immigration .
And I find it less legitimate to mo@@ ck it .
It is not arguments , it is t@@ ang@@ ling .
It repe@@ ats , reiter@@ ates again and again , when something aw@@ k@@ ward , the exc@@ itement to fail to understand what it is all about for the sole purpose of ma@@ pping out a message .
Sometimes it has some interesting arguments .
And he is interested in a subject that is close to his heart .
People who regularly ask ec@@ ology , for example , for example , are not judged .
After all this debate is quite different , everyone can interpret things differently .
It repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats and repe@@ ats again and again &#91; ... &#93; for the sole purpose of ma@@ pping out a message .
A@@ h , dear , another xenophobic C@@ ain !
Un@@ believ@@ able , you are multi@@ plying !
There must be a fear of the great replacement ? &apos; .
It is like the pu@@ b .
When you say , say again , that in such a shop is cheaper , that there is such a reduction , and so on .
The purpose of the message is not to be an argument .
The aim is to exist and to occupy space .
We can agree with that .
There is no substance to it .
There is nothing other than an expression of deep hatred of those whom he identified as ali@@ ens .
I believe that there is a fund .
He believes that immigration is not something B@@ ati@@ ati@@ que according to his or her .
He is therefore trying to draw attention to what he thinks is important and the negative side .
Not that he has a problem with people in particular ( a kind of French immigrant than the French ) , but with the principle of multicul@@ tur@@ alism , demo@@ graphy and religion .
I know nothing about it , but that is what I am talking about .
I repeat a quote from one day on the forum to support my first point ( fortunately I was reminded of the name of the author ) .
The oldest attitude , which is undoubtedly based on solid psychological foundations , since it tends to re@@ appear in each of us when we are placed in an unexpected situation , is to simply repu@@ di@@ ate cultural forms : moral , religious , social and a@@ es@@ thetic forms , which are the most remote . These are the ones we identify with .
“ sav@@ age sav@@ age , ” “ this is not in our home , ” “ we should not allow that to happen , ” so many crude reactions that reflect this same ch@@ illing , the same re@@ pul@@ sion , the presence of people who live , believe , or think that we are ali@@ en to .
An@@ tic@@ ity thus confused everything that did not take part in Greek culture ( then G@@ reco@@ -@@ Roman ) under the same name of bar@@ b@@ arians ; Western civili@@ zation then used the term sav@@ age in the same direction .
However , behind these ep@@ i@@ the@@ ts is the same judgment : it is likely that the barbaric word is swit@@ ched off to the confusion and in@@ lin@@ ation of the birds ’ s@@ ong , opposed to the meaning value of the human language ; and sav@@ age , which means ‘ forest ’ , ev@@ o@@ kes a kind of gender as well . Animal life as opposed to human culture .
&#91; ... &#93; This thought attitude , in the name of which we reject ‘ sav@@ age ’ ( or all those who are chosen to be regarded as such ) outside humanity , is precisely the most striking and inst@@ inc@@ tive attitude of these very sav@@ ages .
... humanity stops at the borders of the tri@@ be , from the linguistic group , sometimes even from village ; to such an extent that a large number of so-called pri@@ mi@@ tive populations nom@@ inate themselves a name that means ‘ men ’ ( or sometimes – shall we say with more discretion ? – “ Good ’ s , “ excellent ” ( “ complete ” ) , im@@ plying that other tri@@ bes , groups or villages do not participate in virtu@@ es or even human nature , but that they are at most “ bad ” , “ bad gu@@ ys , ” “ land mon@@ ke@@ ys , ” or “ of land . ” Po@@ or eggs . ”
People often go so far as to deprive the foreign of the latter of reality by turning them into a ‘ gh@@ o@@ st ’ or ‘ appearance ’ .
In this way , there are cu@@ ri@@ ous situations in which two interlocu@@ tors are cruel@@ ly re@@ plic@@ ating .
In G@@ ran@@ des Anti@@ l@@ les , a few years after America ’ s discovery , while Span@@ i@@ ards sent investig@@ ative committees to search for whether the indigenous people had a soul , the latter used to im@@ mer@@ se white prisoners in order to check , through prolonged surveillance , whether their c@@ ad@@ res were dead . It was or was not a matter of pu@@ ff@@ fac@@ tion .
&#91; ... &#93; by denying humanity to those who appear to be the most &apos; sav@@ age &apos; or &apos; barbaric &apos; of its representatives , one is simply using one of their typical attitudes .
The barbaric thing is , first and foremost , man who believes in bar@@ b@@ arity .
As@@ sum@@ ing of such facts – and other areas of civilisation , such as social institutions , art , religion , and religion would easily provide them – one won@@ ders whether human societies do not define themselves , given their mutual relations , by a certain optimis@@ m . Di@@ versity beyond which they cannot go , but which they cannot get out of without any danger .
It is a diversity of diversity , and it is the relationship with the other cultures that are compromised .
Fe@@ wer diversity , and it is each culture itself that is at risk .
&#91; ... &#93; too many differences , and the gap becomes insur@@ moun@@ table ; not enough differences , and identity dies .
* I object to the abuse of language in which , increasingly , there is more and more to be confused with racism and normal , legitimate attitudes , in any case , in any case .
Racism is a doctrine that claims to see in the intellectual and moral character of a set of people the necessary effect of a common genetic heritage .
Under the same heading , or automatically as@@ cri@@ be to the same prejudice the attitude of individuals or groups that their fi@@ de@@ lity to certain values makes partially or completely in@@ sensitive to other values .
It is by no means guilty of putting a way of living and thinking above all others and of having little attr@@ action to or such like such or such , whose kind of life , respec@@ table in itself , is moving away from the one that has been traditionally attached to it .
This relative mis@@ communic@@ ability may even represent the price to be paid for the systems of values of each spiritual family or community to remain , and find in their own funds the resources needed for their renewal .
If , as I have written elsewhere , there is some optimum optimis@@ m between human societies beyond which they cannot go , but below which they cannot get out of danger either , we must recognise that this diversity is largely the result of each culture ’ s desire to oppose those surrounding it . From one word to another , from one word to the other : they are not aware of them , they are borrowing on occasion , but in order not to per@@ ish , it must be the case that , under other reports , there is still a certain im@@ per@@ ability between them .
The company knew what was going on .

Not funding that is g@@ los@@ sed over in ro@@ tten projects , not jobs that serve no purpose , not lack of health and justice , and so on .
Clearly , a few unemployed who abuse this is a bigger problem , and I am sure that it is these people who lose billions every year .
Why are you not taking on the intoler@@ ant words where there is no tolerance ?
That is a shame .

But in a country that is proportionately richer .
But continue to p@@ oun@@ ce on the tra@@ ine@@ es and continue to vote for the same representatives if you find that the &apos; situation has improved &apos; .
It is your absolute right , &#91; E@@ ve &#93; : and as the poverty line is a relative measure , we can continue this methodo@@ logical debate for a very long time .
I just hope that this way of thinking about inequality will become less widespread .
The context is playing a great deal , but let us try !
1 - 3 : Yes .
As far as the 3 is concerned , the context remains crucial .
4 : A debate and evidence from a judicial point of view , on the basis of the influence exercised by X X , but good , if it is not a murde@@ rer , it is complicity with murder / acc@@ ess@@ ory to the cur@@ der / y@@ ou@@ g .
5 : &apos; There is no 5 bor@@ del &apos; , I am disappointed .
6 : grey area , I imagine that by studying the level of awareness of the risks ( such as this type of X is un@@ consci@@ ously doubtful or said &apos; it is going to go over dozens of years &apos; ) , the murder can be considered .
7 - 9 : no , but it is a level 2 .
10 : no , it is bad , but the ca@@ usal relationship is too difficult to establish .
11 : it is far too uncertain .
It is absolutely impossible to ensure that action does not lead to the death of anyone , just as the opposite is the case .
Therefore , you will always arrive at scenarios or we can argue that , despite the potential for the death of some , other more laudable actions on paper would ultimately present the same risk .
My response specifically targeted the C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ is I@@ mp@@ are@@ l Research , not all aid to the private sector .
Having said that , I am a little disappointed with the do@@ -@@ votes received on my comment ( I do not target myself ) , when I only gave an opinion in a respectful manner .
If you get your product from X + 3 to X + 2@@ 36 , either your product is already expensive , and the price increase to compensate for the tax will not be felt by consumers , or it will be too important for consumers to be able to continue to offer themselves and return to an alternative .
If you want to reduce the demand to increase &apos; only &apos; by 1.@@ 5 ° C , is it not better to ensure that practices that jeopardise this objective are no longer possible ?
Do you want to continue to make profit until it is no longer possible at all ?

There is no leader , however ,

Allow me to dis@@ pel a whole raft of stereotypes that we find in this comment .
I am pol@@ ite , so I did not la@@ ment anyone over the last few days when the world ( more specifically the media ) has wh@@ it@@ tled away the “ storm of the century . ”
All we have to do is to make up for ourselves .
Firstly , I have already seen worse on several occasions in the year that I spent Bas@@ -@@ Sain@@ t L@@ au@@ rent .
From a person &apos;s point of view , I could easily lau@@ gh Qu@@ e@@ b@@ ou@@ o@@ is ( who could also lau@@ gh at the Mon@@ tre@@ al@@ ese , because I spent a winter in Mon@@ tre@@ al as well , and that was nothing of winter in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ) .
Secondly , as Al@@ ber@@ t@@ ain , I could have lau@@ ded the Qu@@ e@@ b@@ ec@@ is , who have cancelled all the plans , sports matches and so on because of the road conditions &apos; so dangerous &apos; .
I did not la@@ ment , because I understand that it is prudent not to take risks when you are not used to it .
But this storm has been like every other storm in me@@ ad@@ ows every year .
We live with , and I have led under the same conditions in cities , on the motor@@ way , in the mountains ( the worst ) almost always without winter ty@@ res and always in a small c@@ ash@@ -@@ t@@ ank ( tr@@ action before ) and without incident .
It is easy enough , it is not like a c@@ on and is aware of the condition of the road by testing the bra@@ kes often and when no one is close .
Thirdly , I have been in E@@ ud@@ mon@@ ton several years .
It is a bul@@ sh@@ ish comment .
I must admit that Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c is better than E@@ d@@ mon@@ ton ( Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c is like 3@@ x 3@@ x ) , but Ed@@ mon@@ ton is good in de@@ ton@@ ation .
The bon@@ a fi@@ de world is not treated first because the small residential streets ( the city has caused too much of it ) are not treated first .
But the city quickly rele@@ ases the roads for buses and other major roads .
They manage s@@ now effectively in E@@ d@@ mon@@ ton .
And finally , the British Colombia ’ s com@@ mentary has full errors .
You par@@ ade the L@@ ow@@ er Main@@ land ( ie me@@ tr@@ o V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver ) and forget that the other million kilome@@ ters are receiving a lot of s@@ now , especially in the mountains .
British people from outside V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver are quite accustomed to doing so .
Better than several cities here .
Moreover , how many “ Chinese ” know the West ?
I am not too aware of the situation in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , but Al@@ ber@@ ta has a b@@ p of people of Chinese origin including second-@@ generation B@@ c@@ p B@@ c@@ p , who are as competent as others because they were born in Al@@ ber@@ ta .
Life is not impossible , if that is what you want to hear .
But it is all very well to advise against being in opposition , that is all .
Im@@ ag@@ ine that the government in France set itself up to make allowances conditional on a particular commodity ( like g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine ) with an identity card that contains a whole host of inf@@ oes on you like the tone of your political orientation , income , your religion , and so on .
Even if this does not affect the size of the female population , the government that is taking advantage of Google will do so .
What would you think if Mac@@ r@@ on announced it tomorrow ?
The mainstream newspapers are biased against Mad@@ uro , and that is normal and that is what the majority in the West expects of them .
On the other hand , you will have to be reminded of the misleading articles from the Mon@@ de because it is also not very complicated to s@@ lander Mad@@ ur@@ o , his policy is open to criticism , and it often happens to him to tell him very well .
Mad@@ uro is not Chávez .
He will never go back to the UN to critici@@ ze the P@@ O@@ T@@ US with a ch@@ om@@ sky but@@ cher in his hand .
Then the situation in Venezuela goes a little further than &apos; oil equals American interference &apos; .
That is not entirely false , but it is simplistic and it will convince a great deal of world .

But what about the extreme left and communism ( past and present ) ?
1 / Le Communism was only applied in poor countries , whose regimes were unstable , viol@@ ently , that is to say , in contexts where the regimes were failing to act .
The minimum to judge communism ( if so much that the countries that claimed it were , but I do not have the impression that democracy and collective ownership by workers were the model applied , but let us go on ) would at least be tested in a favourable minimum .
On the contrary , the extreme right has seen what it does in all conceivable contexts , and every time it is horror .
Having said that ...
2 / ... I am not a communist , so I am a little proud of it .
3 / Venezuela was never a Communist country .
In order to go far beyond the Naz@@ is , the social left was on the social side as a whole .
That is completely un@@ true .
There was no social progress , trade union , or eg@@ al@@ itarian progress under Naz@@ ism , and it was not because they added on the “ socialist ” end in their name that they conducted social policies ( the Mar@@ x@@ ists were , moreover , their top victims in addition to Jews ) . .
But that seemed to me to be deserved , because you were just talking about F@@ N , and not L@@ ES .
I do not see the point of talking about the extreme left in France as it accounts for less than 1 % of voters , and the representation of its ideas , as well as being at the lowest possible level , is a clear decline in the world .
I can only wonder what business would do if the Naz@@ is came to power today .
They would do the same thing systematically systematically : they would work together in their overwhelming majority .

The risk is that if you propose a return rate of 5 % to invest in T@@ es@@ la , you will say no .
It is a connection .
There is a high risk of R@@ R@@ R .
What the market offers : for your fri@@ vol@@ ous tone could be placed on the stock market or on the bank .
<unk> g@@ t@@ ; to return to our oil projects .
You have thought very carefully .
You find that it is on the back of .
T@@ u believes that the acceptable R@@ R@@ R , given inflation and risk , is 7 % .
<unk> g@@ t@@ ; <unk> g@@ t@@ ; T@@ u make 100 + ( 0 + 1.@@ 0@@ 7 ) + ( 0 / 1.@@ 0@@ 72 ) + ( 120 / 1.@@ 0@@ 73 ) ( 2.@@ 0@@ 4
<unk> g@@ t@@ ; <unk> g@@ t@@ ; T@@ u make a 100 + ( 60 + 1.@@ 0@@ 7 ) + ( 50 / 1.@@ 0@@ 72 ) + ( 5 / 1.@@ 0@@ 73 ) = 3.@@ 08 .
The first project is a negative one .
You lose fri@@ vol@@ ous .
The second project is the most profitable one .
That was not the case .
Why is it more profitable ?
Because the second project , with the second project , is recovered in the first year and second year .
It is more rec@@ laim@@ ed earlier in your poc@@ ket .
What is the point of saying what ?
That you can put it on the stock market or other projects immediately .
And that you will hit the $ dollars sooner .
Reg@@ ar@@ dless of the project you are launching , you are moving in the direction of health , social and environmental consequences .
<unk> g@@ t@@ ; T@@ u sha@@ ken off the number of people who are going to kill or seriously inj@@ ure .
We are moving in this direction , but then we are completely .
The only tru@@ c that matters is to do the N@@ P@@ V .
In fact , to calculate the N@@ P@@ V we need a R@@ R@@ R rate .
R@@ R@@ R as R@@ ate of In@@ f@@ lation , R@@ is@@ k , and Mar@@ k@@ let R@@ ate of R@@ et@@ ur@@ n .
This rate therefore includes the risk of losing fri@@ vol@@ ous status .
The risk that you will be tram@@ pled under@@ foot , that you discover that you are violating the law , that you do business , that the whole population revol@@ ts .
The R@@ R@@ R includes everything .
TO@@ U@@ T .
If it is positive , we are doing so .
There is no such thing as a destructive effect on seed biodiversity , if it k@@ ills the consumer , if a ca@@ ke is paid for the illegal activities of La@@ fe@@ discharge or if it spe@@ eds up climate change further .
It is for that reason that it makes me add &apos; o@@ h companies destroy the environment by selling even more pl@@ as@@ tics . &apos;

At a time when a major decision is taken , the sole aim is to ensure that the central capital gets as much capital as possible .
For@@ get the &apos; Val@@ ors &apos; page of B@@ N@@ P Par@@ i@@ bas or S@@ FR .
These pages are addressed to the general public .
The only rule is not bankruptcy , no prison , D@@ O IT .
All decisions in finance are based on that .
All of them .
It is argued that if you lose fri@@ vol@@ ous or hard judicial ( not a min@@ able fine ) , the destruction of the brand image ( which is a waste of fri@@ vol@@ ous ) or a violent political attack ( which is a waste of fri@@ vol@@ ous ) is being lost .
Cas@@ h is King .
As a result , if government wants investment no longer , then it must take tough action .
In the event of a breach of the law of extremely violent fines ( EUR 10 , 20 billion ) or se@@ iz@@ ure of force by the state .
This will lead to a significant increase in R@@ I@@ SK , which is one of the important elements in the calculation of the N@@ P@@ V .
Invest@@ ors will therefore refuse to put their money where their mouth is .
The N@@ P@@ V is all that counts .
P@@ as@@ cal <unk> g@@ t@@ ; P@@ as@@ cal Qu@@ ir@@ y was elected better Professor of H@@ EC Paris .
He has written a book called Finance of En@@ ter@@ prise .
It is L@@ E Re@@ ference in Finance in France .
It explains the priority of a good business leader , and it is the constant search for the ren@@ t-@@ seeking .
The ren@@ t-@@ based system ( Micro@@ soft ) , the agreements between companies ( the Joint Agreement on In@@ tel / Ap@@ ple / Google / Google ) , the construction of a strong ( Ap@@ ple ) image , the creation of a consumer / consumer deal ( S@@ system ) . or the weakening and division of suppliers ( large bran@@ ds and the textile industry , or L@@ ac@@ it@@ is and milk sel@@ lers ) .
The ren@@ te is what makes it possible to increase the margins .
That is what makes the difference between the corner and a big business@@ man like Bill G@@ ates or V@@ inc@@ ent Bo@@ ll@@ or@@ é .
With regard to the famous letter on the obtaining of the passport .
There are two different versions , therefore .
Ben@@ al@@ la ’ s is incompatible with that of Stra@@ da .
... or then , the hypo@@ thesis that I am submitting to you , and which I have not heard from anyone ( and who perhaps does not hold the road : did I lau@@ gh at the elements that would invali@@ date him ? ) : is it possible for a 3@@ r@@ d figure to make these two versions together ?
Is it conceivable that an employee of the Presidency would request a passport on behalf of Ben@@ al@@ la , without noti@@ fying his service at the time and without telling him that he was responsible as a result of the re@@ vel@@ ations in the Car@@ ard En@@ link over the last few days ?
Stra@@ ight would have said her truth last week , Ben@@ al@@ la would have said her today .
This 3@@ r@@ d man myster@@ ious , a member of the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e Man@@ i@@ gra@@ m , knows the truth , but would rather remain silent in the hope of not being affected by the scandal .
If so , is Ben@@ al@@ la aware of this action from the beginning but only lea@@ ked it to justice last week when the question was asked for the first time ?
That would be the case , it is an opportunity for your opinion .
And of course ... / r / un@@ ti@@ t@@ te@@ th@@ ha@@ d@@ u
That is exactly why T@@ ru@@ p was elected to the US .
Because the populism of it had l@@ acked its guilt for everything and was aware that they are also the problem .

I wonder whether those Members who have resigned will come back to the block bar@@ rel now that the game is no longer there to throw out the water .
The N@@ P@@ D should plant itself in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c in the forthcoming elections , which will give B@@ Q at least the chance to keep the existing seats as far as progress is concerned , but Blo@@ c has for years ( dec@@ en@@ n@@ ated ? ) only a gr@@ ub@@ b@@ ing-up movement in these cor@@ ners of the Qu@@ e@@ u Qu@@ e@@ u . B@@ est sovereign@@ ti@@ sts .
It is a good idea to believe in this .
As from the day after the presidential elections , our fav@@ our@@ ite ed@@ it@@ ori@@ alists explained to us that the L@@ R and PS pon@@ ds would be allowed to go to the European level , that he would leave the whole mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess with the mer@@ ging of the mer@@ chan@@ ts to run during the par@@ l@@ ance state of Mac@@ ron , and then that he would leave the mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ e with the mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess . He was going to recover everything for the final s@@ print .
One can have a candidate X@@ avi@@ er Ber@@ tr@@ and , or even a Sarkozy .
One candidate can have Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de or even H@@ id@@ al@@ go or even Le Fol@@ l or V@@ all@@ a@@ ud .
One can have a Her@@ v@@ é M@@ or@@ in if B@@ ay@@ ro@@ u understands that he will never win and that we must re@@ juven@@ ate .
We can have T@@ au@@ bir@@ a in the PR@@ G .
We can have a P@@ C or N@@ PA breakthrough .
We can have a counter@@ course Phili@@ p@@ po@@ t or Mé@@ gre@@ t .
Perhaps someone will make it clear to Ham@@ on that he does not have the char@@ is@@ ma and that he will take his place , gender Au@@ br@@ y .

It is a c@@ lic@@ h@@ é and certainly also the visible part , but I have spent good time with my colleagues when I bo@@ ast@@ ed in S@@ S@@ II to do various and varied activities , even with sp@@ ies that make ki@@ y@@ ups .
I do not have the impression that &apos; to discover new tru@@ ths , to find a n@@ ana , to travel , to make an eye &apos; are incompatible with being develop@@ er ...
Some of them have a lot of pas@@ sions and a couple of lives , if you are not happy where you are going and you can afford it , there is no move !
You are as old as the age ?
Per@@ so made me a V@@ E@@ E , it is a good experience , it is something other than S@@ S@@ II for me and a little travel , and so on .
It was a good fight to discover other tru@@ ths !
Apart from a quote without quote on the English wi@@ re , which says that it holds an Guin@@ ness record , it is impossible to have anything to confirm .
What I have been aware of when I sear@@ ched a little is that it is perhaps not as str@@ on@@ gh@@ t-@@ for@@ t and reliable as it would be to calculate an audience and sha@@ m and so on , so I imagine that it is difficult to do more than an interesting an@@ ec@@ do@@ te and not an interesting an@@ ec@@ do@@ te . There is no doubt about it .
However , thank you all , thank you : )
You are not simply being asked to make presentation , we are often asked to make data extraction with al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms .
This kind of ta@@ ff has been proposed with my po@@ t in bi@@ -@@ inf@@ o ( it makes m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular sim@@ ulation with programmes that he is responsible for ) .
I do not say that we need a doc@@ torate , but at least we need to be engine@@ er .
W@@ ine I am looking for
The Ro@@ y of Ro@@ y
C@@ reat@@ ing this to be the case .
I look forward to presenting you with the latest inter@@ change in inter@@ ne@@ sia , the last communication facilit@@ ator , the last way forward in terms of the read Re@@ d@@ din : the d@@ ash S@@ .
To use it : <unk> <unk> ( not to be taken too seriously )
Bar@@ te promised mental health in five years &apos; time .
This is lau@@ g@@ hable by the world when it is four years &apos; term of office .
There is no excuse for the CA@@ Q , but the two parties are not empty words .
I ab@@ h@@ or my h@@ at .
There is no change in origin .
Unless you want to be judged according to the background .
I am not interested in this .
And what is a racist passage ?
The speed of over@@ sho@@ oting ?
It is good .
I know that we are not on the subject of auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation , but the way forward is reserved to over@@ sho@@ ot at the maximum speed of over@@ sho@@ oting .
If you do not matter as much as you do as a matter of course , you have no business at all .
Yes , speed must be mod@@ ul@@ ated according to road conditions , but it is not fair for the way out .
An@@ aly@@ sis when you go over and over as soon as the limit is reached .
It has the police and every driver to decide its security speed certainly not to a match or my on@@ c@@ le that is blocking the left route for others to decide for others .
They can put someone outside for the reason they want , as long as this is not illegal .
9@@ 8.@@ 5 has just taken advantage of this situation to react to a g@@ ang of re@@ payment .
It was an an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal event to say that an o@@ op refused entry to a hum@@ or@@ ist because he had din@@ ad@@ s , like a typical example of an@@ ec@@ do@@ te .
N@@ orm@@ ally , 9@@ 8@@ .5 ( 5 ) are making a tragedy a tragedy .
As a result , it is a ti@@ rage for the general population , but only the x of the population that it suits will accept ?
Yes .
T@@ u G@@ u is going to have a bo@@ g@@ us assembly with that , it is worth taking a look at the fate of the general population .
This is not an ir@@ ony .
If you will allow me to go to the ASEAN , I will go and follow the rules , but I will sab@@ otage the work as much as I can , even if I can damage my fellow citizens .
( It will be done well , they will have put me there . )
Do you so much like this arbitrary representa@@ tiveness ?
I say arbitr@@ arily , because in your Assembly you are not going to put children under two years of age or mentally ill if they are ?
O@@ ut of S@@ af@@ ar@@ i ’ s “ bu@@ g , ” may well be the fault of the We@@ b develop@@ ers and not the b@@ row@@ ser , but I regularly have sites that bur@@ n under S@@ af@@ ar@@ i , and when I go under Ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ i ’ s Ch@@ ro@@ me , I regularly have sites that run under S@@ af@@ ar@@ i .
I am using S@@ af@@ ar@@ i as the main navig@@ ator ( if only for its integration with mac@@ O@@ S and H@@ an@@ o@@ ff / i@@ O@@ S func@@ tion@@ alities , Au@@ to@@ fil@@ l S@@ M@@ S@@ S , etc . ) , but I will open Ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ i from a somewhat cumbersome or soft web of We@@ b enforcement . .
The problem is that develop@@ ers develop Ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um ( because it has to be admitted to bu@@ gg@@ ers and other tools ) , will@@ s test in Ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ e ( because he has 2 / 3 of the market ) so that becomes the default by default that imposes the norm .
Instead , I am going to give Fi@@ re@@ o@@ x a chance because , given the various comments , he would have moved in the right direction .
I will read the article because Ju@@ dic@@ ith is tram@@ pling me on the str@@ at@@ um .
But I am going to say something else about the pu@@ b G@@ ill@@ te :
The message was good , but multinationals use good causes as a marketing tool ( not because they believe it , just because a ca@@ b is going to make a sh@@ t@@ t@@ w and hence a pu@@ b ) .
Above all , G@@ ill@@ et@@ te can go back , Child Labour and cement .
Mr President , Mr Pap@@ ay@@ anna@@ kis ,
o@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate apparently has been closely super@@ vised , if you wo@@ o@@ den in wo@@ o@@ den quantities is truly toxic , the Sri Lan@@ k@@ an workers who bur@@ ned water containing gl@@ y@@ ph@@ hosp@@ ate have not invented their sudden illness as soon as the appearance of the European Union . G@@ y@@ ph@@ ph@@ os@@ ate .
I do not understand the history of this discred@@ ited resear@@ cher .
Know@@ ing the scientific method , I am well aware that we can sk@@ il@@ fully prove that gl@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate is not dangerous if there are s@@ ins .
I do not understand those who defend the non-@@ ban of gl@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate , those who defend those who are in favour of gl@@ y@@ ph@@ hosp@@ ate .
It is totally ob@@ vi@@ ous that there is a J@@ er@@ k pr@@ o gl@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate cir@@ cu@@ it of billions of dollars .
With medicines , agriculture is the second largest trading power in the world in a sense , as if you decided what sal@@ t would buy all humans on earth .
I would like to say , quite clearly , that mon@@ san@@ to has a power EN@@ OR@@ M@@ E power on studies , scientists are not a race to have mon@@ ks who live in au@@ tar@@ ky in the mountains far from the world , there are good and bad things as everywhere , it is quite clear that Mon@@ san@@ to has a mon@@ san@@ to . T@@ yp@@ ically or by far , the positive scientific en@@ qui@@ res on gl@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate have been tr@@ acked down .
We talk about so much money , it is co@@ los@@ sal , it is a huge customer , it is an official customer , all countries are pushing and all countries need to ra@@ m the land of we@@ eds .
TO@@ U@@ S .
The Sri Lan@@ k@@ an region , the United States , has a r@@ out , the United States , and I mean a Q@@ U@@ I V@@ A market .
It is limited if mon@@ san@@ to is not the only one has petrol , it is un@@ imagin@@ able the power they have .
I can see directly from the scientists who say , good , I have boo@@ ked all my life , have been integrated , only in my label , and all of a sudden , I am offered the salary of 10 life such as mine to om@@ it a detail and I am assured that it will be done so sk@@ il@@ fully that my name is not my name . It will never be sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent .
How do you want there to be none who refuse to do so .
It is comparable with the invention of the w@@ ashing machine has the home of the home of the 196@@ 0s , with the ro@@ ck re@@ aring land in less than two when it was before you had a tens of hours pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed up .

With regard to the dangers .
It is quite clear that the tr@@ ick is harmful .
I understand the gall@@ eries to ban it after years of use .
It is as if you were saying , the machine w@@ ashing is toxic , having more access it w@@ ashing now is going to have to go into man@@ ual fashion .
Ar@@ med with the cir@@ cus@@ es of the cir@@ cu@@ re@@ k of people who have been paid at least to say a great deal of mon@@ san@@ to .
This report is a fair one .
If there are errors that is not serious .
Without such people , you will not be alive .
H@@ ec@@ k@@ ling F@@ l@@ ass
Will the owners increase it when a wild est@@ ate dec@@ is@@ es everything before they go ?
It is not a gift to me .
If they find a way to do it , they will do so without asking questions .
I brought my daughter to the nur@@ ser@@ y this morning .
Just to get back into the room it is kept , a small step is being taken and takes it viol@@ ently ( both two and a half years from now ) , and it falls well 1 me@@ tre away , head not far away from a wo@@ o@@ den structure .
There were three nur@@ ser@@ y staff in this room , including the manag@@ er , for less than 10 children .
Not a single one is reacting .
As a result , as this was the third time that this bo@@ y took my daughter to me ( two times another day , without a great deal of reaction ) , it was warm to me and I began to bur@@ y the small , with staff indifference .
My daughter during that time was terror@@ ised and never stopped m@@ our@@ ning ( a child of her age , it easily m@@ our@@ n , but it was really violent as push for the age of the bo@@ y ) .
By the way , I said to the Executive Board that if it were to start again , I wanted to speak parents with the small bo@@ y , which is normal .
She replied &apos; o@@ h o@@ h , but we already know , it is not as it is with your daughter , he is followed by the p@@ y , her parents know it &apos; ...
I replied in substance that I agree , but I would like to talk to the parents , if that happens again , and she has taken me from a rather aggressive tone : &apos; O@@ h but outside the cr@@ è@@ che &apos; as if I was going to get together with them .
That was a mo@@ ck@@ ery for the day .
It is already because I am the one who has been left behind when women remain passive , and also because if this is not the first time , it is not the first time that the bo@@ y is pushing M@@ A , even sur@@ ren@@ dering the case .
That may well be the case .
And if my daughter falls into a to@@ y or the re@@ board of a table ?
This will be the time to talk about it when it is paraly@@ sed or worse ?
A@@ A@@ A@@ H@@ h@@ ha@@ h .
That is the better way to go about it .
