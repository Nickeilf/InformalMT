The functioning of medieval societies is a legacy of these ancient mythical and religious structures, and there is continuity.
As Westeros looks more like the Middle Ages, it is easier to think of it.

I had only one piece of work, in a thrifty, that I had to accept and order for the staff, that almost all of the time was being put to me and I was not entitled to stop (even after having to work 6-7 hours of the deceiter) before I had finished all the commissions. Reports and deliveries.
At the beginning was cool but hard, I was glad to do something else for once that stay at home, as well as the money, and that was why sport was all the less benign.
When one of my colleagues with whom I worked and who I was working with, what would I say?
It was wrong to get your foot to make the orders.
He and I have never been heard, despite my multiple attempts (to share out the tasks).
At the end of the day, there were a number of orders, and we also had to take stock of the fridge, so I say to him that I agree to take stock of the fridge if he does the rest.
It is in agreement.
I will end the work and go home.
Next Monday, I am called upon to say that there is a big problem that the orders which have been made have not been made.
They are that my colleague had 'forgotten' to do his job except that, instead of admitting it, he was guilty of blaming me, I at the beginning did not understand what was going on. I was asked to go and do it in a topical and urgent debate in 15 minutes.
Then I was told in royal calmness that everything was my fault and I am made redundant.
I am not particularly trying to fight (the hotel was in court), I had a plane ticket in 1 months to break off the island for six months, so it was going a little further and left me time to move.
However, I still have this betrayal of this treason, and for an initial working experience it really is no longer complete.

Mr Bah, not because, once again, you deliberately ignored the whole historical background, that is to say, a few millennia ago of the injustice of men / women and a culture that is still macho.
You can not make a law, a rule, without context.
Making a 'white' square is the same, you would forget a few centuries of slave labour.
In fact, it is not biased, it is dishonest, because you deliberately refuse to take into account the reality of today's society and its historical foundations, because they do not support your reasoning.
And you are unaware of the whole historical background of segregation between men and women in favour of segregation as the only solution to the problem we are talking about.
And are you going to be extrapolating to me?
Saying out completely the other solutions, by pretending to espouse this one, because the situation makes it necessary.
But on an application that knows the identity of all the speakers, who can know their position, which notes, who receives comments from customers, etc.
Do you really believe that segregation really is no solution?
And when I propose the wearing of weapons, you claim not to oppose it for ideological reasons, as I am against segregation for ideological reasons, but because it is prohibited.
However, sexual discrimination is also prohibited.
Ggt; Algo, let us be insane, propose.
Because, if you stop telling us on this tick box, the solution is that BlaBlain is offering the same to men, which will serve as a dull and will not make any progress at all, but will solve your problem.
This is an indication that you do not read mine.
I do not want a man 's box.
I do not want discrimination.
As Nelson Mandela did not want the black against white people, he wanted an end to racism.
You think so little by little that you do not realise that we can defend individuals.
It is not for fear of offending men that I am against, it is because of fear of offending everyone.
Improving gender discrimination in the two sense, prejudices, clichés, cultural differences that explain differences in access to power.
So if it is, if it is, a 'Uber feminine', as it stands, could perhaps make a fury (said: unfortunately, because not, basically, I am too much for this kind of thing, I was just saying that the simple fact that this measure is taken shows that it is a fact that this measure is being taken. The basic problem is real.
Ah bin the demos, which is bound to be there.
Gender clichés have permeated society so much.
You know that there would probably also be strong demand for female doctors for women, for women's sports rooms, for cafés reserved for women, for women's shops, etc.
That is what you want?

Bah no, the sixtieth sixty were 40 years.
Let me remind you that you are told that the anti-ascée law is finally going to be used to stop the bad guys.
It is therefore necessary.
This is something you will not remember: crimes of aggression against physical persons, aggression on the forces of order, voluntary violence, destruction of public furniture, injuries and injuries exist.
The fact that the glaring crime is admissible as evidence is admissible.
That the judge can already ordered pre-emptive arrests if evidence of gang violence is provided, such as a Facebook call, thanks to the entire arsenal of the state of emergency that has integrated into the law.
So what is the need for this new, extremely liberticidal, authoritarian and dictatorial law to stop the perpetrators?
When such a law hinders the freedom to demonstrate without order of a judge, when proceedings can only be exercised with the assistance of a lawyer after the event, so that a judge assesses the correctness of the measure, that this appeal can last for years with the presumption of guilt in the meantime, When such a law hampers individual freedoms, who can support it?

You said that a carbon tax would not work because the population would reject it.

Macron tax the poor and redistributes to the rich.
It is strictly the opposite of what the consensus says to do.
It is not because macro is said that it is a carbon tax that it is.
As a result, "knowledge" in economics has not enabled them to see the stron of macro raison d'être?
Ignorance?
Or do you know very well the yellow belts are not opposed to the carbon tax as described by the consensus but are pretending to confuse both in bad faith?

I did not ask for a political movement.
Just that they learn to demonstrate in law, without causing scrap, that they learn to clean up their rallies that muddy their message.
If you really want to talk about a political movement, even though I do not want to make them a pub, we have to recognise that they have been moving quickly.
All the more so because of the reasons for the policies, it was my explanation, it was a movement which was created in the defiance of representation.
We are reaping the will of our political classes to restrict democracy to the vote.
There is no such thing as representation as a result of current policies.
It goes back much further and it is difficult for a country to turn its back on the size of France.
Above all, the continuation of the traditional functioning of the Fifth Republic was favoured by the majority of French people who had the opportunity to vote for a candidate who proposed an opening towards a 6th Republic with fewer representation, professional assemblies,... (not perfect, but the least worst candidates in my opinion).
No if you are still in the same system (of merchants, we agree) it is because of the choice of the people.
It is a puerile thing to put the blame on the policies.
Where, then, do I have to explain why rather than accuse me.
The forces of law and order must respect a graduated response and not target their heads.
We agree on that, and there are some bad things in the police that may have done so.
However, I sincerely believe that, in such a confusion, you can find the upper part of someone's body without having targeted this place.
It is true that there will be laissez-passers and that is not normal.
The work of the police is also about protecting the population, including the one that is obvious.
Can it really protect the CJGs if demonstrations are not declared?
Is it what they are giving them the means to do the work they are asking for?
Is there not a certain degree of complacency about the thugs and a willingness to break with the forces of law and order with the forces of law and order?

There was a slow rise to 24-25% on the day of 3 in debate, and the QQ returned to 17-18% next week.

It could have played a smokescreen and perhaps the PQ could have gone back in 26-27%, seeing CAQ the position of those who can beat the PLQ, but the pro-CAQ narrative was firmly installed since the Louis-Hebert partial.

I would like to know how it is to find ourselves a joke in Quebec? (pay / requirements in general).
It is the job shortage in Québec in Quebec and very easy to find a job, even with 'just' a DEC; if, for example, you want to be a developer, you will not wait for so long to wait for it.
pay will vary greatly depending on the employer, the SMEs, the consultants, and so on.
There is nothing to send you on your CVs to know more.
Having said that, I would like to look at the general package.
One of my regrets is to have worked at the start of a career in poorly organised SMEs with low wages and no pension funds or other benefits.
Many SMEs claim to have a cool culture but will propose ridiculous wage increases every year.

The Bac in Info at Laval, at the time at the very least, had a lot of more theoretical courses that were not so interesting.
At Bac vs. DEC, it really depends on what you want to do in the longer term.

Firstly, I am not very offended.

They try to get away from tragically losing one or other loved ones and seeing pictures of them in a fiction work.
Not a reconstruction of so-called events to the new, not a documentary, not a film on the subject, but a completely detached truc.
People who give psychological and moral support to survivors always advise against news ballot papers for several weeks.
There are too great events to prevent them, as 11 September mentioned earlier.
The families of the victims of 9 / 11 did not look at Flight 93, or the French documentary on the fire brigade, the film with Nic Cage, etc.
But if the pictures of the towers were used in a film on apocalypse, they would be right to feel scorned or insulted.
In the case of Bird Box, it is a sequence of what, barely two seconds, and still?
But it is a bad thing for someone who has lost his family in a monster accident and is trying to distract himself from a sound horror of horror, so that in the middle of the film he restores the explosion that he made his wife or children or friends...
The problem is that laziness in fiction makes gestures insensitive to their producers.
It is not obvious to make an explosion of this intensity and it costs an arm.

At the same time, being in Barcelona does not mean heat the whole year.
It is a port town, after all.
(The mec of my oncle lives in an old building, in the Barcelona centre, thermal insulation is washed away, too, in winter and probably shares pain).
I would like to turn my attention to the matter.
I am interested in what people do not think.
I think it is legitimate to have a fear of the immigration of people from other continents with other cultures and to see the world.
It is even natural to see this as wild bushes, and it is a completely human reaction to preserve it.
What is not as you are or is familiar with a fear gives rise to a fear, a curiosity that is being rejected.
Especially when he can see some of the immigration problems (the examples he provides) in a way.
I think it is legitimate for a population to have concerns about immigration.
And I find it less legitimate to mock it.
It is not arguments, it is tangling.
It repeats, reiterates again and again, when something awkward, the excitement to fail to understand what it is all about for the sole purpose of mapping out a message.
Sometimes it has some interesting arguments.
And he is interested in a subject that is close to his heart.
People who regularly ask ecology, for example, for example, are not judged.
After all this debate is quite different, everyone can interpret things differently.
It repeats, repeats and repeats again and again [...] for the sole purpose of mapping out a message.
Ah, dear, another xenophobic Cain!
Unbelievable, you are multiplying!
There must be a fear of the great replacement? '.
It is like the pub.
When you say, say again, that in such a shop is cheaper, that there is such a reduction, and so on.
The purpose of the message is not to be an argument.
The aim is to exist and to occupy space.
We can agree with that.
There is no substance to it.
There is nothing other than an expression of deep hatred of those whom he identified as aliens.
I believe that there is a fund.
He believes that immigration is not something Batiatique according to his or her.
He is therefore trying to draw attention to what he thinks is important and the negative side.
Not that he has a problem with people in particular (a kind of French immigrant than the French), but with the principle of multiculturalism, demography and religion.
I know nothing about it, but that is what I am talking about.
I repeat a quote from one day on the forum to support my first point (fortunately I was reminded of the name of the author).
The oldest attitude, which is undoubtedly based on solid psychological foundations, since it tends to reappear in each of us when we are placed in an unexpected situation, is to simply repudiate cultural forms: moral, religious, social and aesthetic forms, which are the most remote. These are the ones we identify with.
“savage savage, ”“ this is not in our home, ” “we should not allow that to happen, ” so many crude reactions that reflect this same chilling, the same repulsion, the presence of people who live, believe, or think that we are alien to.
Anticity thus confused everything that did not take part in Greek culture (then Greco-Roman) under the same name of barbarians; Western civilization then used the term savage in the same direction.
However, behind these epithets is the same judgment: it is likely that the barbaric word is switched off to the confusion and inlination of the birds ’ song, opposed to the meaning value of the human language; and savage, which means ‘ forest ’, evokes a kind of gender as well. Animal life as opposed to human culture.
[...] This thought attitude, in the name of which we reject ‘ savage ’ (or all those who are chosen to be regarded as such) outside humanity, is precisely the most striking and instinctive attitude of these very savages.
... humanity stops at the borders of the tribe, from the linguistic group, sometimes even from village; to such an extent that a large number of so-called primitive populations nominate themselves a name that means ‘ men ’ (or sometimes – shall we say with more discretion? – “Good ’ s,“ excellent ” (“complete ”), implying that other tribes, groups or villages do not participate in virtues or even human nature, but that they are at most“ bad ”, “bad guys, ”“ land monkeys, ” or “of land. ” Poor eggs. ”
People often go so far as to deprive the foreign of the latter of reality by turning them into a ‘ ghost ’ or ‘ appearance ’.
In this way, there are curious situations in which two interlocutors are cruelly replicating.
In Grandes Antilles, a few years after America ’ s discovery, while Spaniards sent investigative committees to search for whether the indigenous people had a soul, the latter used to immerse white prisoners in order to check, through prolonged surveillance, whether their cadres were dead. It was or was not a matter of pufffaction.
[...] by denying humanity to those who appear to be the most 'savage' or 'barbaric' of its representatives, one is simply using one of their typical attitudes.
The barbaric thing is, first and foremost, man who believes in barbarity.
Assuming of such facts – and other areas of civilisation, such as social institutions, art, religion, and religion would easily provide them – one wonders whether human societies do not define themselves, given their mutual relations, by a certain optimism. Diversity beyond which they cannot go, but which they cannot get out of without any danger.
It is a diversity of diversity, and it is the relationship with the other cultures that are compromised.
Fewer diversity, and it is each culture itself that is at risk.
[...] too many differences, and the gap becomes insurmountable; not enough differences, and identity dies.
* I object to the abuse of language in which, increasingly, there is more and more to be confused with racism and normal, legitimate attitudes, in any case, in any case.
Racism is a doctrine that claims to see in the intellectual and moral character of a set of people the necessary effect of a common genetic heritage.
Under the same heading, or automatically ascribe to the same prejudice the attitude of individuals or groups that their fidelity to certain values makes partially or completely insensitive to other values.
It is by no means guilty of putting a way of living and thinking above all others and of having little attraction to or such like such or such, whose kind of life, respectable in itself, is moving away from the one that has been traditionally attached to it.
This relative miscommunicability may even represent the price to be paid for the systems of values of each spiritual family or community to remain, and find in their own funds the resources needed for their renewal.
If, as I have written elsewhere, there is some optimum optimism between human societies beyond which they cannot go, but below which they cannot get out of danger either, we must recognise that this diversity is largely the result of each culture ’ s desire to oppose those surrounding it. From one word to another, from one word to the other: they are not aware of them, they are borrowing on occasion, but in order not to perish, it must be the case that, under other reports, there is still a certain imperability between them.

You can hear voices, chairs, and then an adult ordered to silence.

You are punctuated in the room... a simple presence is commanding the silence requested earlier.

The method of establishing all those who are not Brunet as necessarily being manipulated or creative against the FLN because of 'leftist', while refuting their qualifications, says extremely long on your ideology.

So, to speak of race in France is the first step in racism, but it is not racism.

As far as the 3 is concerned, the context remains crucial.
4: A debate and evidence from a judicial point of view, on the basis of the influence exercised by X X, but good, if it is not a murderer, it is complicity with murder / accessory to the curder / youg.
5: 'There is no 5 bordel', I am disappointed.
6: grey area, I imagine that by studying the level of awareness of the risks (such as this type of X is unconsciously doubtful or said 'it is going to go over dozens of years'), the murder can be considered.
7 - 9: no, but it is a level 2.
10: no, it is bad, but the causal relationship is too difficult to establish.
11: it is far too uncertain.
It is absolutely impossible to ensure that action does not lead to the death of anyone, just as the opposite is the case.
Therefore, you will always arrive at scenarios or we can argue that, despite the potential for the death of some, other more laudable actions on paper would ultimately present the same risk.

There is a problem of logic here.

Allow me to dispel a whole raft of stereotypes that we find in this comment.
I am polite, so I did not lament anyone over the last few days when the world (more specifically the media) has whittled away the “storm of the century. ”
All we have to do is to make up for ourselves.
Firstly, I have already seen worse on several occasions in the year that I spent Bas-Saint Laurent.
From a person's point of view, I could easily laugh Quebouois (who could also laugh at the Montrealese, because I spent a winter in Montreal as well, and that was nothing of winter in Quebec).
Secondly, as Albertain, I could have lauded the Quebecis, who have cancelled all the plans, sports matches and so on because of the road conditions' so dangerous'.
I did not lament, because I understand that it is prudent not to take risks when you are not used to it.
But this storm has been like every other storm in meadows every year.
We live with, and I have led under the same conditions in cities, on the motorway, in the mountains (the worst) almost always without winter tyres and always in a small cash-tank (traction before) and without incident.
It is easy enough, it is not like a con and is aware of the condition of the road by testing the brakes often and when no one is close.
Thirdly, I have been in Eudmonton several years.
It is a bulshish comment.
I must admit that Quebec is better than Edmonton (Quebec is like 3x 3x), but Edmonton is good in detonation.
The bona fide world is not treated first because the small residential streets (the city has caused too much of it) are not treated first.
But the city quickly releases the roads for buses and other major roads.
They manage snow effectively in Edmonton.
And finally, the British Colombia ’ s commentary has full errors.
You parade the Lower Mainland (ie metro Vancouver) and forget that the other million kilometers are receiving a lot of snow, especially in the mountains.
British people from outside Vancouver are quite accustomed to doing so.
Better than several cities here.
Moreover, how many “Chinese ” know the West?
I am not too aware of the situation in Vancouver, but Alberta has a bp of people of Chinese origin including second-generation Bcp Bcp, who are as competent as others because they were born in Alberta.
Life is not impossible, if that is what you want to hear.
But it is all very well to advise against being in opposition, that is all.
Imagine that the government in France set itself up to make allowances conditional on a particular commodity (like gasoline) with an identity card that contains a whole host of infoes on you like the tone of your political orientation, income, your religion, and so on.
Even if this does not affect the size of the female population, the government that is taking advantage of Google will do so.
What would you think if Macron announced it tomorrow?
The mainstream newspapers are biased against Maduro, and that is normal and that is what the majority in the West expects of them.
On the other hand, you will have to be reminded of the misleading articles from the Monde because it is also not very complicated to slander Maduro, his policy is open to criticism, and it often happens to him to tell him very well.
Maduro is not Chávez.
He will never go back to the UN to criticize the POTUS with a chomsky butcher in his hand.
Then the situation in Venezuela goes a little further than 'oil equals American interference'.
That is not entirely false, but it is simplistic and it will convince a great deal of world.

But what about the extreme left and communism (past and present)?
1 / Le Communism was only applied in poor countries, whose regimes were unstable, violently, that is to say, in contexts where the regimes were failing to act.
The minimum to judge communism (if so much that the countries that claimed it were, but I do not have the impression that democracy and collective ownership by workers were the model applied, but let us go on) would at least be tested in a favourable minimum.
On the contrary, the extreme right has seen what it does in all conceivable contexts, and every time it is horror.
Having said that...
2 /... I am not a communist, so I am a little proud of it.
3 / Venezuela was never a Communist country.
In order to go far beyond the Nazis, the social left was on the social side as a whole.
That is completely untrue.
There was no social progress, trade union, or egalitarian progress under Nazism, and it was not because they added on the “socialist ” end in their name that they conducted social policies (the Marxists were, moreover, their top victims in addition to Jews)..
But that seemed to me to be deserved, because you were just talking about FN, and not LES.
I do not see the point of talking about the extreme left in France as it accounts for less than 1% of voters, and the representation of its ideas, as well as being at the lowest possible level, is a clear decline in the world.
I can only wonder what business would do if the Nazis came to power today.
They would do the same thing systematically systematically: they would work together in their overwhelming majority.

Before we invest in a project, we are making budgeting capital.
It is known that the Valor Net Nette (VN) has been calculated, in English the Net Present Valume (NPV).
As a result, future cash flows have been disbanded by investment on the basis of inflation, market, and risk rates.
To put it bluntly, can I find a hyper-profitable trick that pays more to shareholders than anything else?
If the project is beneficial, it is spearheaded.
<unk> gt; Tu has EUR 100.
Two giant oil fields are being proposed.
In the first project you invested EUR 100 in the first project.
<unk> gt; Tu hit EUR 0 in the first year.
Mr Tu is talking about EUR 0 in the second year.
Tu Gu is touching EUR 120 the third year.
In the second project you invested EUR 100 in the second project.
<unk> gt; Tu hit EUR 60 in the first year.
Mr Tu is talking about EUR 50 in the second year.
Tagiti Tu affects EUR 5 in the third year.
What plans do you choose?
It depends on your RRR.
The Required Rate of Reurn.
You are demanding the rate of return on investment.
It is also sometimes known as' opportunities' for capital cities.
As a result, the project is in competition with other projects that need thumbs.
The RRR depends on three things:
Start Inflation: Inflation
The risk is that if you propose a return rate of 5% to invest in Tesla, you will say no.
It is a connection.
There is a high risk of RRR.
What the market offers: for your frivolous tone could be placed on the stock market or on the bank.
<unk> gt; to return to our oil projects.
You have thought very carefully.

<unk> gt; <unk> gt; Tu make a 100 + (60 + 1.07) + (50 / 1.072) + (5 / 1.073) = 3.08.
The first project is a negative one.
You lose frivolous.
The second project is the most profitable one.
That was not the case.
Why is it more profitable?
Because the second project, with the second project, is recovered in the first year and second year.
It is more reclaimed earlier in your pocket.
What is the point of saying what?
That you can put it on the stock market or other projects immediately.
And that you will hit the $dollars sooner.
Regardless of the project you are launching, you are moving in the direction of health, social and environmental consequences.
<unk> gt; Tu shaken off the number of people who are going to kill or seriously injure.
We are moving in this direction, but then we are completely.
The only truc that matters is to do the NPV.
In fact, to calculate the NPV we need a RRR rate.
RRR as Rate of Inflation, Risk, and Marklet Rate of Return.
This rate therefore includes the risk of losing frivolous status.
The risk that you will be trampled underfoot, that you discover that you are violating the law, that you do business, that the whole population revolts.
The RRR includes everything.

Cash is King.
As a result, if government wants investment no longer, then it must take tough action.
In the event of a breach of the law of extremely violent fines (EUR 10, 20 billion) or seizure of force by the state.
This will lead to a significant increase in RISK, which is one of the important elements in the calculation of the NPV.
Investors will therefore refuse to put their money where their mouth is.
The NPV is all that counts.
Pascal <unk> gt; Pascal Quiry was elected better Professor of HEC Paris.
He has written a book called Finance of Enterprise.
It is LE Reference in Finance in France.
It explains the priority of a good business leader, and it is the constant search for the rent-seeking.
The rent-based system (Microsoft), the agreements between companies (the Joint Agreement on Intel / Apple / Google / Google), the construction of a strong (Apple) image, the creation of a consumer / consumer deal (Ssystem). or the weakening and division of suppliers (large brands and the textile industry, or Lacitis and milk sellers).
The rente is what makes it possible to increase the margins.
That is what makes the difference between the corner and a big businessman like Bill Gates or Vincent Bolloré.
With regard to the famous letter on the obtaining of the passport.
There are two different versions, therefore.
Benalla ’ s is incompatible with that of Strada.
... or then, the hypothesis that I am submitting to you, and which I have not heard from anyone (and who perhaps does not hold the road: did I laugh at the elements that would invalidate him?): is it possible for a 3rd figure to make these two versions together?
Is it conceivable that an employee of the Presidency would request a passport on behalf of Benalla, without notifying his service at the time and without telling him that he was responsible as a result of the revelations in the Carard Enlink over the last few days?
Straight would have said her truth last week, Benalla would have said her today.
This 3rd man mysterious, a member of the Elysée Manigram, knows the truth, but would rather remain silent in the hope of not being affected by the scandal.
If so, is Benalla aware of this action from the beginning but only leaked it to justice last week when the question was asked for the first time?
That would be the case, it is an opportunity for your opinion.

It is not even an influence, therefore, would it really be an objective?
I cannot say why, especially in France, but I know that one of the traits of pseudo-science is that they are at the intellectual level of many and gives a sense of superiority.
The Duning-Krueger effect in action.
Cha is a beautiful game, it is!
Oh, yes, Madam!
Now sink to panic!
People have problems, but not so much that it is privileged.
And their problems are their fault because of their toxicity.
There is another county with no argument...
Eighteen for me often be promised 20 and 55, it would say, above all, that the world is too reckless.
Alternatively, it was two years before Christmas.
I returned from the family to return home on the 20 to so many verglas, my wire, and my wives were flowing into a glimpse of ice by wheelers and wheelers at 100-110 who found themselves in the gap not long after the end of the day. It was a long time ago.
On the subject of the madman I went on to get rid of the devil quickly, I failed to get out of the car.
For me, the yellow bets wanted to block the biggest trade center on the first on Saturday (a Leclerc with almost the Leclerc derivative in the market gallery so few collateralized disgates).
Then there is the fact that it is being turned into round-point squito, without ever coming back to this commercial centre.
At least they did not come to the city centre, they at least understood who was not the enemy.
I had this sensation because, on the way out of the ingested school, it was a bit like that and with time you changed and you want something else.
When I started to scrap, it was not really the majority of the profiles that I experienced.
It is a cliché and certainly also the visible part, but I have spent good time with my colleagues when I boasted in SSII to do various and varied activities, even with spies that make kiyups.
I do not have the impression that 'to discover new truths, to find a nana, to travel, to make an eye' are incompatible with being developer...
Some of them have a lot of passions and a couple of lives, if you are not happy where you are going and you can afford it, there is no move!
You are as old as the age?
Perso made me a VEE, it is a good experience, it is something other than SSII for me and a little travel, and so on.
It was a good fight to discover other truths!
Apart from a quote without quote on the English wire, which says that it holds an Guinness record, it is impossible to have anything to confirm.
What I have been aware of when I searched a little is that it is perhaps not as stronght-fort and reliable as it would be to calculate an audience and sham and so on, so I imagine that it is difficult to do more than an interesting anecdote and not an interesting anecdote. There is no doubt about it.
However, thank you all, thank you:)
You are not simply being asked to make presentation, we are often asked to make data extraction with algorithms.
This kind of taff has been proposed with my pot in bi-info (it makes molecular simulation with programmes that he is responsible for).
I do not say that we need a doctorate, but at least we need to be engineer.
Wine I am looking for
The Roy of Roy
Creating this to be the case.
I look forward to presenting you with the latest interchange in internesia, the last communication facilitator, the last way forward in terms of the read Reddin: the dash S.
To use it: <unk> <unk> (not to be taken too seriously)
Barte promised mental health in five years' time.
This is laughable by the world when it is four years' term of office.
There is no excuse for the CAQ, but the two parties are not empty words.
I abhor my hat.
There is no change in origin.
Unless you want to be judged according to the background.
I am not interested in this.
And what is a racist passage?
The speed of overshooting?
It is good.
I know that we are not on the subject of authentication, but the way forward is reserved to overshoot at the maximum speed of overshooting.
If you do not matter as much as you do as a matter of course, you have no business at all.
Yes, speed must be modulated according to road conditions, but it is not fair for the way out.
Analysis when you go over and over as soon as the limit is reached.
It has the police and every driver to decide its security speed certainly not to a match or my oncle that is blocking the left route for others to decide for others.
They can put someone outside for the reason they want, as long as this is not illegal.
98.5 has just taken advantage of this situation to react to a gang of repayment.
It was an anecdotal event to say that an oop refused entry to a humorist because he had dinads, like a typical example of anecdote.
Normally, 98.5 (5) are making a tragedy a tragedy.
As a result, it is a tirage for the general population, but only the x of the population that it suits will accept?
Yes.
Tu Gu is going to have a bogus assembly with that, it is worth taking a look at the fate of the general population.
This is not an irony.
If you will allow me to go to the ASEAN, I will go and follow the rules, but I will sabotage the work as much as I can, even if I can damage my fellow citizens.
(It will be done well, they will have put me there.)
Do you so much like this arbitrary representativeness?
I say arbitrarily, because in your Assembly you are not going to put children under two years of age or mentally ill if they are?
Out of Safari ’ s “bug, ” may well be the fault of the Web developers and not the browser, but I regularly have sites that burn under Safari, and when I go under Chromii ’ s Chrome, I regularly have sites that run under Safari.
I am using Safari as the main navigator (if only for its integration with macOS and Hanoff / iOS functionalities, Autofill SMSS, etc.), but I will open Chromii from a somewhat cumbersome or soft web of Web enforcement..
The problem is that developers develop Chromium (because it has to be admitted to buggers and other tools), wills test in Chromie (because he has 2 / 3 of the market) so that becomes the default by default that imposes the norm.
Instead, I am going to give Fireox a chance because, given the various comments, he would have moved in the right direction.
I will read the article because Judicith is trampling me on the stratum.
But I am going to say something else about the pub Gillte:
The message was good, but multinationals use good causes as a marketing tool (not because they believe it, just because a cab is going to make a shttw and hence a pub).
Above all, Gillette can go back, Child Labour and cement.
Mr President, Mr Papayannakis,
oyphosate apparently has been closely supervised, if you wooden in wooden quantities is truly toxic, the Sri Lankan workers who burned water containing glyphhospate have not invented their sudden illness as soon as the appearance of the European Union. Gyphphosate.
I do not understand the history of this discredited researcher.
Knowing the scientific method, I am well aware that we can skilfully prove that glyphosate is not dangerous if there are sins.
I do not understand those who defend the non-ban of glyphosate, those who defend those who are in favour of glyphhospate.
It is totally obvious that there is a Jerk pro glyphosate circuit of billions of dollars.
With medicines, agriculture is the second largest trading power in the world in a sense, as if you decided what salt would buy all humans on earth.
I would like to say, quite clearly, that monsanto has a power ENORME power on studies, scientists are not a race to have monks who live in autarky in the mountains far from the world, there are good and bad things as everywhere, it is quite clear that Monsanto has a monsanto. Typically or by far, the positive scientific enquires on glyphosate have been tracked down.
We talk about so much money, it is colossal, it is a huge customer, it is an official customer, all countries are pushing and all countries need to ram the land of weeds.
TOUS.
The Sri Lankan region, the United States, has a rout, the United States, and I mean a QUI VA market.
It is limited if monsanto is not the only one has petrol, it is unimaginable the power they have.
I can see directly from the scientists who say, good, I have booked all my life, have been integrated, only in my label, and all of a sudden, I am offered the salary of 10 life such as mine to omit a detail and I am assured that it will be done so skilfully that my name is not my name. It will never be subservient.
How do you want there to be none who refuse to do so.
It is comparable with the invention of the washing machine has the home of the home of the 1960s, with the rock rearing land in less than two when it was before you had a tens of hours ploughed up.
TET UNELE ENTREEPRISE (VENS MOND MOND MOND LE MOND).
Nan, but my god.
With regard to the dangers.
It is quite clear that the trick is harmful.
I understand the galleries to ban it after years of use.
It is as if you were saying, the machine washing is toxic, having more access it washing now is going to have to go into manual fashion.
Armed with the circuses of the circurek of people who have been paid at least to say a great deal of monsanto.
This report is a fair one.
If there are errors that is not serious.
Without such people, you will not be alive.

Will the owners increase it when a wild estate decises everything before they go?
It is not a gift to me.
If they find a way to do it, they will do so without asking questions.
I brought my daughter to the nursery this morning.
Just to get back into the room it is kept, a small step is being taken and takes it violently (both two and a half years from now), and it falls well 1 metre away, head not far away from a wooden structure.
There were three nursery staff in this room, including the manager, for less than 10 children.
Not a single one is reacting.
As a result, as this was the third time that this boy took my daughter to me (two times another day, without a great deal of reaction), it was warm to me and I began to bury the small, with staff indifference.
My daughter during that time was terrorised and never stopped mourning (a child of her age, it easily mourn, but it was really violent as push for the age of the boy).
By the way, I said to the Executive Board that if it were to start again, I wanted to speak parents with the small boy, which is normal.
She replied 'oh oh, but we already know, it is not as it is with your daughter, he is followed by the py, her parents know it'...
I replied in substance that I agree, but I would like to talk to the parents, if that happens again, and she has taken me from a rather aggressive tone: 'Oh but outside the crèche' as if I was going to get together with them.
That was a mockery for the day.
It is already because I am the one who has been left behind when women remain passive, and also because if this is not the first time, it is not the first time that the boy is pushing MA, even surrendering the case.
That may well be the case.
And if my daughter falls into a toy or the reboard of a table?
This will be the time to talk about it when it is paralysed or worse?
AAAHhhah.
That is the better way to go about it.
