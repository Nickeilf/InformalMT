UK@@ IP who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example .
You talk about when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom for health tourism , and when , with this in mind , it says yes when the inter@@ view@@ er asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the un@@ desi@@ ra@@ bles .
First of all , you are using speci@@ ous arguments , and then you dis@@ credit them with a barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Wh@@ enever I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we must qu@@ e@@ ue behind intoler@@ ants to the chronic hypo@@ con@@ d@@ ri@@ e which thinks that they are all due to them .
I think it is you who are using speci@@ ous arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the righ@@ t-@@ w@@ ing@@ ers , hardly exists .
I believe that is what we call democracy .
Then no one would be affected by UK@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
Only in the parallel uni@@ verse of UK@@ IP can Car@@ s@@ well appear as a revolutionary .
There is no evidence of a tor@@ ch@@ on quot@@ ation .
Yes , let us get on with the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail did not write the report , it did nothing but comment on it .
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for propag@@ ating such populist propaganda as if it were reality .
I do not think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You know nothing either of my personal situation or of my identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
Far@@ age was a great surprise , but only because there is so much talk so rarely about this problem .
He made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic remark .
You will have to succeed in putting it back to you .
I am not , of course , where you want to come from , but I imagine that you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like .
This is so rarely discussed because unlike Far@@ age and his dis@@ ci@@ ples , who are fil@@ med from That@@ cher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of go@@ d and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are something good , no .
Finally , the situation is as ro@@ tten in Ireland as it is in Spain .
With the new crisis , the austerity period will not have helped .
S@@ tri@@ king nearly 5 % growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
Ireland is the European Union &apos;s EURO@@ P@@ E T@@ G@@ R@@ F , and there are some annex@@ es of it .
We have seen the follow-up !
It once again read the article .
At@@ temp@@ ts are being made to believe that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that a N@@ O@@ U@@ V@@ E M@@ IR@@ AC@@ L , EC@@ U@@ O@@ M@@ I@@ Q@@ E , is currently taking place .
With the Brussels Agreement , on the lowest soci@@ al-@@ welfare groups in Europe , a flexible working march and continued em@@ power@@ ment .
With these ing@@ ra@@ des , let us not po@@ pp@@ y at the moment with the arrival of the Poles .
In the 1980 ’ s of the twentieth century , it was leading one of the poorest countries of Euro@@ pa , with Portuguese , considering a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter without the inf@@ ants , the situation is always better than it was .
There was a Green in front of us .
That their development is not a long tran@@ qu@@ il river , it is on the basis of recent dis@@ sent .
Is Europe the lowest in Europe ?
That is not true !
Latvia has an im@@ po@@ t rate of 0 % on businesses .
Now there is a hypocrisy in France from policies on the im@@ po@@ ts that have been paid for by the multinationals again and again .
According to a report from 2008 or 2009 , they pay less than 5 % in France .
It is only SMEs that pay for themselves .
Now I can confirm that the road traffic has become bo@@ gged down again , and there are new cars ( and sh@@ y ) there is every corner of the street , just as before the 2008 crisis .
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years , and the recovery is evident in everyday shops since the entry .
Is that supposed to be economic news ?
Do not worry , I am sure that the comments will soon go fl@@ at .
In another article which they are currently writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ u@@ l A@@ str@@ a is involved in a c@@ up of the A@@ 140 .
Will R@@ y@@ an@@ air now shift passengers from one flight to another in this way ?
I believe that Mr O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft , so a few bo@@ xes and radiation on the old will soon be forgotten .
Having said that , I will vote with him next week , so I hope that it will not be on one of these people once they have been si@@ len@@ ced .
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot .
Has R@@ y@@ an@@ air made passengers pay for the additional fear they have been given ?
But without such Irish companies , you could not allow you to go on holiday , young man .
I never took R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the last three times my plane was with B@@ A .
I prefer when the airline offers a good service .
No , but it is R@@ y@@ an@@ air , so they can give it to their joy .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air trigg@@ ers dozens of comments from people who would never take R@@ y@@ an@@ air out of those who love R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff only have to blame themselves , etc .
That is quite transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air is not going to be happy with the additional costs of this incident .
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and , if R@@ y@@ an@@ air is able to avoid paying by saying that this was a mistake by air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers in the airport .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers were placed in another aircraft in less than an hour , they have no right to compensation .
S@@ or@@ ry to dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to the British Air@@ ways flight that takes the English I@@ SIS to Syria , not true as you say .

Last Sunday in Paris , the Frank@@ s@@ burg street : a large part of the Mar@@ sh was pi@@ ge@@ on@@ ist , and literally clu@@ b@@ bed together .
People do not come en m@@ asse for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( most of them ) , or for the Sal@@ on of the magaz@@ ine at the B@@ lan@@ c@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ to space ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly du@@ sty ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the shops are all open and the neigh@@ bor@@ hood is incredibly alive and alive .
With many foreigners who spend ..@@ ...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs ?
G@@ o from Paris R@@ ue of Bour@@ ge@@ o@@ is , where shops were opened up the Sunday , the world bur@@ st 50 % of tourists .
@ al@@ o@@ es F@@ u !
The only argument that seems to me to be admissible is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists , and it is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they are buying tax deduc@@ tions .
The tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
There remains the industry where expensive equipment , exploited on the Sunday , will allow prices to be reduced .
D@@ ed@@ ic@@ al rest is a right for which employees , except for exceptions , benefit .
That is why it is provided for and regulated by the labour code .
Neither the Minister for the Econom@@ y or , indeed , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , have any powers to reform the labour code .
So they are w@@ rap@@ ping it .
The law serves the purpose .
To satisfy some of the population and businesses that want to work on the Sunday .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al on Sunday , I take my small children to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my V@@ ill@@ es of 30@@ ,000 , where I live in France the bi@@ b@@ li@@ o city is open 4 days a week , but not the w@@ it !
That is access to culture ...
It is also the task of regulating working time .

And if his daughter ’ s succession were , against his wishes , to be used to pay the costs of succession ?
There are pain@@ ts .
Some of them are , of course , some terrible ones .
Perhaps his succession would like his share of the ca@@ ke , if you will use the expression .
His preference for a victory for the nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its F@@ as@@ c@@ ist ideas as a whole also add its well-known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
Nor do I .
For five years , however , and only for five years , it was perfect .
In 19@@ 40 , he stood up to the government ’ s other ar@@ ris@@ os who wanted to discuss a “ deal ” with the Naz@@ is , and it won a very sk@@ il@@ ful way .
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy , he united the country in the idea that fighting F@@ as@@ c@@ ists was the only way to win .
The people of the United Kingdom , and France , and Belgium , and ultimately the whole world , can thank Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the hel@@ m for the last five years , just over the last five years .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill ’ s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
Whether its des@@ c@@ endants sell pain@@ ts on the free market to collect money from succession costs , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to be able to ad@@ mire one in a mus@@ e@@ um , let them get the money to buy it .
It is as simple as that .
But we could use tax money .
No one can deny that , when it was “ the moment of truth , ” Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill ’ s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only promote large companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by avoiding hi@@ ring , as infrastructure y@@ ards are by definition not renewable .
As for the social reforms recommended by the Minister , they reflect the true Fran@@ ç@@ a@@ ise : if there is mistrust of the dialogue , there is mistrust of dialogue .
Back to the pr@@ inc@@ est values .
There is no contradiction between a reform of unemployment insurance .
That the weakest of us are not in need !
Either solidarity is behind us , or it has D@@ R@@ ILO in exchange for the services it ren@@ ders or has delivered to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H that I prefer to share in this vision is in line with that vision .
There is also the donor who lives on his property income .
The person who in@@ ve@@ sts for a return at the time of his retirement and who lives with his or her ren@@ ts should be differentiated .
A good to hi@@ re or even two for a couple is vice versa .
The small gen@@ i@@ us of Fin@@ al is sing@@ ul@@ arly lacking in imagination .
The new deal was a policy of major works , but at a time of major infrastructure defici@@ ency .
Today , in Europe and France , this is not the case .
The developed countries are being sh@@ rou@@ ded .
The need for infrastructure is therefore marginal in no way a new deal could be a solution .
Especially at a time when the issue of de@@ growth is emerging in response to a recession that is , in other words , brutal dec@@ ency .
You would have been right 30 years ago : more ( or possibilities ) of dam@@ s , coal mines , motorways ...
But if we want to make the future cli@@ mat@@ o-@@ energy shock less ru@@ ined , then the need for investment is obvious : insul@@ ation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transport and storage of energy , etc .
Ta@@ xation that favours high income and r@@ ing-@@ fen@@ cing .

I have tested all these tele@@ phones and decided on L@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a customer , but not for Ap@@ ple .
I believe it is essential for us to have an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft established this philosophy , we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google , Ap@@ ple , and the community .
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development .
In addition , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer because they are not compatible .
For me , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple , because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design .
Some people attach no value to the design , for them options , func@@ tionality and price are paramount .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let us stop looking for &apos; a better platform &apos; .
Is there “ a better car manufacturer , ” not really , they are different , but similar .
I would like to see a flour@@ ishing port@@ able industry , with radically different approaches for different people and markets .
This is healthier and must be encouraged .
That is in all our interests .

Most of the people I know have i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
Our Ukrainian friends who , according to one of them , fought against ideas , not men ( on the contrary , even in Paris B@@ ob@@ os ) could tell us what ( the ) author is fighting gender ideas and telling us what works they intend to combat .
Or are they doing just the kind of sort described in the Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ ut or Val@@ ours A@@ v@@ ori@@ a ?
Their sources are Ju@@ di@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I love you , and you are an intelligent and cul@@ tured someone .
I said that on a Ju@@ dic@@ ith in the F@@ ur@@ us@@ ato ve@@ in , which was mentioned by Mr Hol@@ oph@@ er@@ in , which was not my li@@ vel@@ iness .
Otherwise , in the &apos; substance &apos; , since you refer it back , this subject does not interest me , and I truly do not see where the problem is : I had hoped that you and your am@@ ies could get me out of my arre@@ ars , because I am slow but I understand ...
@ Jean : Do recognise that , cul@@ turally , I refer Ju@@ di@@ ith to Hol@@ oph@@ er@@ ne , that is the case .
Who is afraid of Mon@@ de ?
But what is afraid of those who fear ?

We can see how in@@ tim@@ ate these studies are at home .
We are , of course , no longer in the debate on the idea .
That is something else , much deeper .
Did you read , Jean , Jean , that the Mon@@ de published an article on the need for the@@ ology ?
On the subject of an idea debate , I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources .
To try to fight ideas from the only ex@@ pos@@ é of their critics ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ at@@ z@@ in@@ ger , inven@@ tor of Gen@@ re The@@ ory or X L@@ ac@@ ro@@ ie , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ an ) does not seem to me to be very rigorous .
But good , as I explained to our Colombian friend , is the whole difference between having an enligh@@ tened opinion and a simple opinion .
I am not at all aware of the nu@@ ance .
I did not read Ju@@ di@@ ith , the very symbolic g@@ or@@ ge of g@@ or@@ ge , I confined myself to the &apos; Second sex &apos; ( that was more than my time ) , which I believe is the source of &apos; source &apos; according to L@@ o &apos;s wishes .

I am beginning to think that there is a bad gen@@ ie whose sole aim is to prevent the people of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything from the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an observatory , even if things improve greatly on the other side of the Cor@@ ad@@ il@@ ère .

O@@ k , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ..@@ .@@ .
The country ’ s @ olo@@ l No vote is not comparable to households as far as management of its budget is concerned , because the time horizon of the state is theore@@ tically infin@@ ite , while that of the household is confined to the life of its members .
Moreover , unless public spending is considered un@@ productive , they contribute to financing material and int@@ an@@ gible investments in future growth and thus to future revenue .
There are a few points to answer .
This is a regrettable decision .
But remember the Hi@@ p@@ po@@ crates ’ s sac@@ red o@@ ath : the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost .
T@@ ot@@ al theory of con@@ spir@@ acy .
Unfortunately , the truth does not correspond to your fant@@ asy .
Med@@ ical staff would like to use them , but they have the hands of the law as written by the policies .
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions rather than having risky sur@@ ger@@ y , the safe ho@@ ot rooms for drug addic@@ ts rather than having them on the streets , etc .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans on these issues want to please the accused m@@ asses .
In fact , doctors do not earn money from medicines .
That is why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors do not earn money from medicines , given that Liberals want our health system to resemb@@ le that of the United States , you should find out how it works .
Do@@ c@@ tors throughout the world are cour@@ ted in the same way , but it is more or less visible .
It may have been wrong to put the blame on B@@ bi@@ bi@@ ans , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to business profits and &apos; research &apos; .
Re@@ ad the few reports on our expenditure by P@@ harm@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ ef@@ its Sch@@ em@@ e and on negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies compared with other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ing the world &apos;s prices for medicines everywhere , as well as the differences between countries on what is free or only on prescri@@ ption .
This is strengthening a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific process , direct or indirect .
In fact , some companies are currently testing mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ es against on@@ co@@ logical pain , despite the laws that hold them back and the expensive permits needed .
Although manufacturers of certain medicinal products may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as mari@@ ju@@ ana , those who reach a version of good quality products to known do@@ ses will largely benefit .
S@@ or@@ ry to tell you this , but you are wrong , there is a lot of things going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharm@@ acies .
As far as that hospital is concerned , they were happy to use it until someone put it on the floor of a hospital official .

If “ researchers ” in social science were making research instead of politics and net@@ working , one could be used for their “ work . ”
An investig@@ ative resear@@ cher , he does not compare one fact to another .

Com@@ par@@ ing this is to do with the teaching not of research .
We cannot say ‘ research is being done ’ , it must be applied , and then in the same j@@ et ‘ we have to experiment with everything ’ .
If your research is successful , why experi@@ mentation ?
If your research is not successful , why do you ask you to apply them ?

To make the paragraph on tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hi@@ ps ( which unfortunately is not very argued ) , and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conser@@ va@@ tism : ‘ It is a mechanism that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force and does not allow the system to be taken forward ’ .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , one cannot hope that only practi@@ tioners teach practi@@ tioners , even if they have their full place in modern teachers ’ training .
Education the@@ or@@ ists must have no place .
The practi@@ tioners must have one .
Would you want to be operated by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and which has never set foot in a oper@@ a bloc before ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system .
To give education the@@ or@@ ists more weight would be to destroy it once and for all .
Your analo@@ gy is completely fool@@ ish : if I would not like to be operated by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has only a theoretical training , I would still like to make less use of a sur@@ ge@@ on who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the t@@ all .

If one day I feel guilty to violate copyright , I will have to read an article such as this one .
In an information economy , the violation of copyright is the@@ ft .
It is the same as they have to quote their sources properly .
Often , obtaining a licence does not cost anything .

By using content without the right licence , you are depriving artists of their livelihood .

I have always been working in private enterprise for a long time .
I have had C@@ H@@ AC@@ E working in companies run by excellent business leaders : it exists in France , but it is rare .
I am a salary because I know that I do not have the competence to lead a business , and that choice allows me to take a heavy look at the nu@@ ils that I frequently meet .
In my bas@@ ke@@ t@@ tes , I fully agree with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an ’ s post : he says the horri@@ ble truth !
If one com@@ pa@@ res with German companies that French companies that French entrepreneurs constantly mention to ask for reforms in France , companies in Germany have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive , especially by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , then what are the French bos@@ ses waiting for them to do so ? ? ?

@ Jacques L@@ .

I look forward to all the ‘ negative ’ comments on this subject .
This is ironic , given the way in which people always complain about the F@@ ir@@ st Group .
As I see from where I am , L@@ as@@ t has not really been an investment for us taxpayers .
They tried to keep af@@ lo@@ at rather than turn .
That does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since L@@ ast is involved .

Unfortunately , we do not have the power to do that , unfortunately .
I tried to have them recently , but I did not succeed .

It is an international subsidiary .
They are already operating trains in Germany .
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in inv@@ itations to tender .

Fo@@ cus@@ ing on a disease has nothing to do with merit .
G@@ o on as well as we are going to do .
I say to you that it is L@@ A condition for the ger@@ i@@ ard , and I say to you that F@@ DI .
Nothing has been done with any merit ...
When you look at your life , you have only you to judge them .
I repeat .
In@@ clu@@ ding , if only for a moment , that we can have merit to emerge from a disease or that it may be worth not getting out of it , is simply mon@@ str@@ ous .
The body follows or does not follow .
A body that is cowar@@ dly , despite the will , despite the confidence in medicine , you have a vague idea of what C ?
N@@ avi@@ g@@ ated to think otherwise , if there is no doubt that it will make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it , to try and find experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear .
Some@@ one who is fighting in medicine is , above all , someone who tru@@ sts in medicine .
But if we prefer to rely on the &apos; l@@ ord &apos; , it is something else .

I myself have caught two of them , he@@ in@@ ers , large ones , and if I have &apos; beaten &apos; as they say psycho@@ log@@ ists say , it has completely escap@@ ed me .
Unless this fight is only to sha@@ ke off , to suffer hell and to bur@@ n down .
I believed that the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised a decade ago .
I have not seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time .
What is happening ?
It is an anniversary .
A forgotten birth@@ day .
His trial was conducted “ quickly ” and then swept under the car@@ pet .
Is that the story that was told then ?
The Communist Communist who unle@@ ashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade ?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please ask what we have deliberately left out : 1 .
How could NATO &apos;s bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ments be legal under international law under the L@@ A M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ R@@ R ?
Which country did Serbia attack ?
With regard to R@@ DR@@ s ( Rad@@ io Tele@@ visi@@ on-@@ Ser@@ bi@@ a ) , why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians , then considered it a valid target .
Milosevic had no way out : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , it would be cru@@ ci@@ fied as a tra@@ itor .
And if he defended him , he would be sw@@ ay@@ ed by the Western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
W@@ ester@@ ners used a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en to de@@ t@@ ach part of a sovereign state which then unilaterally proclaimed independence and was almost recognised by the Western states who then li@@ ed to the end of the situation on the ground .
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , died politically after his first term of office for failing to understand the situation that had developed .
Z@@ or@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time .
Ultimately , the Guar@@ dian should not call Milosevic a ty@@ rant ( though we do not love it ) .
To my knowledge , only in Greece is a method of predic@@ ting earthquakes around the corner by measuring the pi@@ zo@@ electric level in the Quartet .
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful , and thank you for sharing it with us .
So there is hope , but caution has nothing to do with that of the O@@ op@@ lan@@ et named H@@ A@@ T@@ -@@ P-@@ 1@@ 1@@ b , located around 1@@ 24 light years from the Earth in the Con@@ st@@ ellation C@@ y@@ n@@ us con@@ st@@ ellation that would be “ the smallest and col@@ d-@@ bloo@@ ded planet . ” De@@ pending water m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules , according to a study carried out by the D@@ rak@@ e D@@ ing and J@@ on@@ a@@ than F@@ ra@@ ine team of Mar@@ y@@ land University ’ s University .
So a M@@ eth@@ o@@ de to follow .
The same applies to those that involve animals sen@@ sing a threat .
Thank you for that as a scienti@@ st who often reg@@ ener@@ ates the experimental pro@@ w@@ ess that is being carried out in the world .
How can animals be saved ( in advance ) ?
There is no doubt that the perception of other factors is changing in the event of an earthquake .
Like the don ’ s ra@@ don , for example .
A pri@@ ori an pri@@ ori od@@ our@@ less gas for the man , but perhaps a dec@@ e@@ it from the animals .
All these methods are in@@ es@@ capable for humans , but not for the measuring instruments at their disposal .
We do not have reliable results on these paths ...
It has been observed repeatedly ( and for centuries ) that some animals are acting in a strange way a few hours with an earthquake , particularly the h@@ ens , cows , dogs , but especially fish and s@@ na@@ kes .
I saw a report on the basis of the struggle of two scientific teams , the other Japanese , to recognise the validity of their work , which related to the sensitivity of animals to the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al mag@@ netic fields , and in particular to their change before se@@ is@@ m@@ ic .
Well , I am not a scienti@@ st , but their hypo@@ thes@@ es have convinced me !
Or are we looking at this research ?
Why dis@@ d@@ ain for this course of action ?
We should learn to listen to nature ...
If we look at things cal@@ m@@ ly and rigorously , we publish it in a serious review , and nobody mis@@ ses it .
As soon as we talk about the “ signs ” of animals , we come up against the same thing : everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned around in circles .
I do not understand why Bor@@ is would be a good leader for the Conservatives .
He has done too much as May@@ or of London .
When you listen to the L@@ BC programme one cannot help but think that this man knows nothing and is always trying to di@@ version with a jo@@ ke .
It never responds directly to anything .
He also said that he agreed with Far@@ age , and then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari asked him what .
He could not name a single point .
He has made so many promises to get himself elected as may@@ or , and he has not kept him .
It only underlines the extent to which the rest of the Conservative Party is a mass of mer@@ chan@@ ts , no ?
Because he is popular .
Because it is fun@@ ny .
He was in H@@ ve I Go@@ t , either .
Because it is a celebr@@ ity and people have been charged with the wor@@ ship of cele@@ bri@@ ties .
The Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him and the same will apply to the rest of the country .
When ( and not if ) he takes the party ’ s leadership , T@@ ories ’ s popularity ratings will restore the ceiling .
May God help us .
I am not so sure : people like the jo@@ kes , but they do not want their Prime Minister to be one of them .
That is exactly what was said about Lon@@ don@@ ers .
He should have brought with him his friend the spons@@ or , smar@@ ter than him .
In many ways , I think he is trying to copy R B@@ ran@@ son .
The Americans have had one of them .

It is understandable that Austr@@ ali@@ ans , who know ( one of their heavy cr@@ us@@ ers , Austr@@ ali@@ a , always have to be content with them since the battle of Sav@@ o ) , did not want to return .

Even if the mission is coming to an end .
It is the small .

Cal@@ cul@@ ate the k@@ er@@ o@@ z@@ en@@ e to achieve the objective is a complete credibility of the credibility of the concept .

Good evening , I think that the red bo@@ y that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip was sponsored by the Brit@@ t@@ any region and the V@@ ill@@ es de Br@@ rest .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a pen@@ ny of our taxes to financing the dreams of a few even as sympathetic ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rers - there !
Are there players in the current Serbian training of Koso@@ van origin ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , once in Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now in the Fe@@ er@@ b@@ h@@ ç@@ e , are Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I do not know whether they are still in the team .
It is Bis@@ ev@@ a@@ c &apos;s defen@@ der of L@@ y@@ on , not B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic was middle ground or before in the 1970s and 1980s and led many teams in Greece , but I do not know where he is .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic is Mo@@ star , Bosnia-Herzegovina , and played as an attack on the great team in Vel@@ z who , under the tu@@ t@@ el@@ age of the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary S@@ ul@@ em@@ an Re@@ c , ended twice in the Yugoslav le@@ ague ( and also counted points like V@@ a@@ hi@@ d H@@ Ar@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and the faithful equi@@ is@@ er of Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ eng@@ er , Bor@@ o Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c ) .
Well , thank you Mo@@ le !
Of course I know H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c .
Just out of cu@@ ri@@ osity , what happened to K@@ ra@@ si@@ c ?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at the Ju@@ ve , he is currently in Turkey , but the last time he appeared on my ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en he was linked to Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , which is not in the ro@@ of .
Here , I cannot help you .
I know he lost his place when Con@@ te arrived , and then he went to the Pen@@ er and as far as I know he was not a holder .
Perhaps he can still do something , perhaps in the Indian Sup@@ er League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Str@@ ic@@ tly speaking , Albania is not afraid .
You should love Albania because you are neighbours .
The ru@@ b is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of the real Albania today .
It was apparently the flag of the Greater Albania , which encomp@@ asses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
A bit of excessive nationalism , in fact .
Fortunately , there has not been too much damage ( as far as I know ) .
In fact , it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is known as the Greater Albania , but of Albania before 19@@ 13 , when the great European powers decided to give their country &apos;s neighbours the country of neighbouring countries .
How can we have felt &apos; an explosion of joy &apos; by seeing two rounds collap@@ sing in the knowledge that women , men and children of children are inside ?
How ?
What bo@@ thers me a little in this &apos; testi@@ mony &apos; is that the fact that , even once , he was able to rejo@@ ice spontane@@ ously for the horrific death of thousands of people , testi@@ fies , in my view , to a man &apos; lin@@ e-@@ line &apos; whose testi@@ mony should be taken with the greatest circum@@ stance . Let us look at it .
Perhaps in the short time of &apos; joy &apos; , we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror me@@ ted out .
One has just thought , for once , that for once Muslims had managed to do truly and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tically bad for the great S@@ at@@ an in its very heart .

It would seem that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been subjected to their sense of humiliation .
With fil@@ med testi@@ monies in Palestine .
S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ ude .
There was some doubt about it .
The Christian / white West / G@@ au@@ laws cannot measure the degree of f@@ rank@@ ness , anger , hatred of the mu@@ su@@ man when he con@@ forms to misery , the social and cultural under@@ development of the Muslim Arab@@ -@@ Muslim world of <unk> today .
I am talking about the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not the tow@@ ers of Dub@@ ai .
The past , certainly a mag@@ ni@@ fied one , is not cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How can we get the Muslim world out of this di@@ abol@@ ical fun@@ eral ?
T@@ ot@@ ally , two major pois@@ ons irrit@@ ate the Arab world : bi@@ go@@ ted conser@@ va@@ tism of existing powers and fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common point , the freezing of thought and communication ( f@@ res@@ h@@ ness or communication ) of his critical expression .
It should not be understood before , that Muslims should not shrin@@ k back .
That is the only way .
Has Ed@@ ward Pl@@ en@@ el read this article ?
I suppose that is true in many countries .
In Britain , however , the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark , we@@ t@@ lands and de@@ pressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people .
Moreover , everyone is falling ill .
Pro@@ ble@@ ms are seasonal .
I have suffered from this myself .
When the light goes , it becomes the hell for me and for those like me .
A do@@ se of vitam@@ in D should help a little for mood and welfare .
The autumn is beautiful in Britain , with or without rain .
The particular campaign is taking place in the autumn .
Not as much to pull the b@@ reath as the green green when everything is living instead of being on the point of dying .
In Britain , if you are lucky , the summer falls a weekend .
We have had a good summer this year , do not make your gr@@ in@@ ding po@@ t in which there are c@@ lic@@ h@@ és !
Not everyone .
I rarely fall ill in winter .
But now I am reti@@ ring and I am not going to develop any more immunity for the ger@@ ms of the outside , which I suppose can change , I suppose .
It is not about dying , it is just a stage in a cycle ...
It is a mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous step full of bo@@ g@@ us sm@@ ell with f@@ es@@ tivities like H@@ lo@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , and other wonderful words .
We only need to stop doing things !
Those are my recommendations for you for you .
Yes , these dark and grey months actually make me much happ@@ ier and more rela@@ xed .
For the tax burden for children to be tax@@ ed , the amount paid by the state mainly origin@@ ated from the 8@@ - to 10 .
But when it comes to the number of households that have had their taxes increased due to this measure , it is mainly those 4 and 5 that are affected ( a medi@@ an income ) according to grap@@ h 2 .
The half-@@ way deletion , especially in relation to wid@@ ows , is not dealt with at all in the article or rather with its impact being over@@ stated : 2@@ 30@@ M is a jo@@ ke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is in@@ dol@@ ent .
And it is not prepared to get on with it .
Well , it is not about the stra@@ w , it is about s@@ wel@@ ling .
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy .
It is clear that those who belong to the richest 20 % have to bear far more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let us continue to do so , and you will encourage this 20 % to work less or to leave .
Well , I know that is not politically correct , but I say it all the same .
L@@ ong live the Tro@@ ts and the O@@ C@@ I recyc@@ led to the PS : they understood everything .
Adam , you do not see what you are looking at .
The proportion is still the same , here or in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population has 80 % of the wealth .
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from am@@ assing as much as he can .
Beyond a certain limit , the value of money loses its usefulness .
Once the value of money is exceeded , money is only used to make money , that is , to say to make the greatest number of people mis@@ fortune .
One of the 20 % is one of the richest .
There is no doubt that 20 % of households that work most ( and create wealth , some of which are logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must allow these households to make use of part of their efforts .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively , at the same time , we should lower our arms and live in minimum social conditions , especially if we have social housing .
Fortunately , the ut@@ op@@ ies of war@@ heads at the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge have lived .

‘ It is very dangerous and highly risky ’ , ‘ No ’ .
You have just l@@ acked luck .
According to the link in the article :
In its discharge , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to T@@ em@@ an was quick , almost absurd .
Within 24 hours , according to an e-mail provided to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b had sent a need@@ le to change the ser@@ r@@ ings , made arrangements for it to spend one week at the ho@@ tel and transfer $ 23 8@@ 17 ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b is in@@ sured , but it did so ) . Be that as it may , it is .
So why does this article quote T@@ em@@ an who complain@@ s that he received no support from Air@@ b@@ n@@ b ?
D@@ OR@@ E A@@ IR@@ B@@ N@@ B , to receive as it does to travel
Good morning I am looking for people who have already used b@@ oun@@ b just to reassure me .
I am planning to pay a quick payment and a month &apos;s rent , but I am a little afraid of sending £ 1@@ 600 to a site which I have never really heard of .
But where do we go from here ?
“ Sup@@ porting the troops , ” s@@ inging the B@@ u ’ s han@@ g over all of them .
That is why it is harm@@ less .
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in H@@ al@@ ab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends succum@@ bed to anything other than the chemical bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment of S@@ ad@@ in S@@ ad@@ in .
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author , your comment is in@@ a@@ property ( to remain pol@@ ite ) .
Moreover , how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
It is not hy@@ per hy@@ pe : ‘ looking for weapons of mass destruction .
There is a great deal of agreement .
You believe that this is the time to weaken the army in order to strengthen education .
This is never the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively : is it the case that TO@@ U@@ J@@ O@@ UR@@ S is the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war ?
A great deal of education would already be done if they were to be ‘ them ’ to work 3@@ 5-@@ hour hours instead of 17 .
At present , our teachers are earning more than engineers .
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme .
But that cannot be seen , since National Education does not have the means to provide a college / school office with its pro@@ s , so they are s@@ inging home .
In short , a kind of forced tele@@ working , except that the employer pays neither the computer , nor the Internet connection or supplies .
Indeed , it is so much the planting at 17@@ .@@ 00 a week and four months of holiday that we are not able to fill the B@@ ad ’ s CA@@ P@@ S , you are waiting for you .
How do you not want to co@@ ok off poorly educated chi@@ ards whose parents are cr@@ ying over you and dealing with them ?

My first qualified job was in the sale , in London , to three times nothing and it was a post for which a diplom@@ a had to be gradu@@ ated .
A year later , I saw an announcement to be working for the London me@@ tr@@ o , which was paid £ 5 000 more per year and was not even asked for a patent .
I have never regret@@ ted that .
In this respect , don &apos;t worry if you do not find a gradu@@ ate job , try to find something or pay good , or you like to do it .
If I had stay@@ ed to qualified jobs , I would still have to pay my student loan .
I do not like business work so much , so I hope in the end either to the civil service or to the academic world .

The best way to reduce the number of unemployed gradu@@ ates ?
To get rid of the b@@ is@@ ou@@ ths as art / letters / theat@@ re / theat@@ re / political science / political science , that is to say , the so-called diplomas of unemployed people .
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished production .
It turned out that the important thing was not a diplom@@ a but , as the article says , a good professional career , starting in school and throughout the university .
Of course , the initial wage was lower , but we rapidly clim@@ b the lad@@ der because , in the real world , what counts is the results more than knowledge .
This debate on artistic engineering has been going on for years .
Scienti@@ sts cannot solve all the problems , it is more important to be able to get up the morning , to get to work time and to inter@@ act with people in order to achieve results .

That is ridiculous .
I assume that you are talking about degrees study of the media or whatever else you have left .
Le@@ t@@ ters , philosophy , political science , and art are real sectors .
We need people who can explain the big issues to school students , who understand the importance of culture bases such as literature , art and so on .
It would not be better to have a genuine territorial policy for fre@@ eing Paris and to revit@@ alise the rest of France ?
Personally , I find it hard to see the people of the se@@ am@@ en of the Es@@ s@@ on@@ ne and the V@@ al-@@ d of O@@ ise making 8@@ 0@@ km aller@@ gies every day in order to come to work in Paris .
In@@ tra@@ -@@ mon@@ gers and small bel@@ ts already have many more common means of transport ( me@@ tr@@ o , buses , tra@@ ms ) .
A number of secure and closed par@@ ks , as already exists in the cities of northern Europe , in Di@@ j@@ on or L@@ y@@ on , will be inst@@ alled on the sa@@ ils .
Good idea .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by R@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark .
So much benefit from their big experience in this area .
Well , there has been no room for U@@ N S@@ U@@ L as a bic@@ ycle c@@ up .
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ and Del@@ ann@@ e … .
Well , that is not right at all .
When discussing with pedestri@@ ans and other transport users the reasons why they do not ped@@ dle , it seems to me that the main reasons for them are : 1 / c is hy@@ per@@ -@@ dangerous with all these l@@ agg@@ ards , these tr@@ uc@@ ks , these sco@@ o@@ ters , these sco@@ o@@ ters , and they ride rou@@ gh@@ sh@@ od over them . The survival of bic@@ yc@@ les and bic@@ yc@@ les in my head , for me , are going to go un@@ he@@ eded ; we need to reduce car traffic ( urban congestion charge ) , reduce speed ( Paris equals zone 30 ) , enforce the road code systematically ( even the win@@ ds ) ( even the win@@ ds ) ( even the win@@ ds . B@@ y@@ mo@@ l predic@@ ts that it is necessary to adapt the code of the road written for a 100 years ago to bic@@ yc@@ les ) , to gener@@ alise the bu@@ ff@@ er zones after the se@@ ated pass@@ ages , not before any if not b@@ agno@@ le or sco@@ o@@ ters .
bic@@ ycle paths are apar@@ theid , we have to live together , but we must re@@ balance the occupation of urban areas .
Nothing on the bic@@ ycle in the great Paris ?
Not a word about the place of bic@@ yc@@ les in public transport ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .
The target of 15 % of vel@@ o de@@ plac@@ ements is ridiculous .
I am beginning to believe that An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go has ru@@ ined the Greens in the meal .

Before the rac@@ ket begins , it would be better to find who really hi@@ des behind this massacre .

It sounds horri@@ ble .
My children are not a financial asset .
A lawyer has expressed his intention to refer the matter to the EC@@ HR , but I have not heard that a complaint has indeed been lod@@ ged .
In addition , they should submit complaints first in Germany or Ukraine .
I also expect these cases to be postponed until the result of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that would ensu@@ e .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , Libya did not blow up P@@ an A@@ m 103 either .
Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a Air@@ lines is not wrong , it is the responsibility of the Aviation Safety Authority , in this case the Ukrainian Government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had been killed previously , Ukraine launched air attacks on the rebels and , of course , any aeroplan@@ e could be regarded as a possible and immediate threat .
Has the Ukrainian Government taken sensible precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines can pay for over@@ flight rights ?
Where are all the pro-@@ Ki@@ ev tro@@ l@@ ls that defend their u@@ sur@@ p@@ ant / ultra-@@ nationalist government in Western Ukraine – and who really want to demonstrate that Putin has killed M@@ H@@ 17 on M@@ H@@ 17 .
As far as I know , there is already a complaint against the government in Ki@@ ev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sk@@ ies .
The precedent was a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice , which concluded that the CIA &apos;s supply of arms to the rebel forces of Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions .
No chance of Russia leaving this case to the IC@@ J .
It is fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t wants to say to Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia .
I hope that he can present evidence to support his allegations .
So far , the investig@@ ators have not said anything like this .
To call Ric@@ ardo and to be such a go@@ o@@ tian B@@ é@@ o@@ tian is dist@@ ressing !
To call Pol@@ ar is lost is rejo@@ ic@@ ing .
A single B@@ o@@ o@@ tian question@@ n@@ aire : is today &apos;s poor being poorer than the poor of yesterday ?
I can only point out that those who are most critical of Pi@@ ke@@ tty &apos;s book have not read it !
It is easy to read , I took a few days .
It shows the statistical development of res@@ titu@@ tion , res@@ ale capital , unequal concentration , inequality of labour income and the ownership of capital , credit and inher@@ it@@ ance in the term .
It shows that today &apos;s concentration of today &apos;s capital is in line with that of the beginning of the 20 before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital , from 19@@ 14 to 1945 , and then how concentration takes up after ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : you are not d@@ ining up to what .
I would ask you how long it has taken you to read this pa@@ ved , bearing in mind that an individual &apos;s capacity for concentration has a few limits .
Secondly , the question is not whether it is easy to read .
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is right or wrong .
If it is right , we can debate it without having read the book whose main purpose is to make a one-@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ fit@@ s-@@ all argument for it .
No , it is easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : how long have you taken it ?
Is the central thesis of its pa@@ ved sum@@ med up by the press ?
I have not read and will not read it .
I am therefore relying on the summary of his central thesis , and it is this one which seems to me to be purely a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en .
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Has humanity not generally enriched itself ?
And this added value added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ z@@ ai is an impressive figure and deserves no doubt .
But remember that it is only 17 years old .
An age with which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world .
I hope that this price will not be a burden on the young gir@@ l and that she will find her way to a happy life .
The problem is not the price , but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old ad@@ age that the per@@ ver@@ ts are the embo@@ di@@ ment of evil .
I wish it all the best in Mal@@ ala , but it must realise that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the work@@ ing-@@ class distric@@ ts in Great Britain !
Some@@ one thought his speech was a little strange .
She than@@ ked her father for giving her a great deal of freedom , but he mentioned that , if she were not where she is now , she would have been married to 14 years .
Does Mal@@ ala itself not form part of these “ per@@ ver@@ ted col@@ our@@ ings ? ”
You should not have any &apos; an@@ ten@@ na time &apos; on that site .
You yourself are a terrible perverse .
That is absolutely appalling .
No , his father was not going to mar@@ ry it to 14 years .
She was 15 years old when she was fired .
His father heads a school where girls are school and he is in favour of equal rights for women .
It is , and has always been , in order for it to receive a higher education and for it to have the right to decide on its marriage itself .
But he is someone who is unusual in Pakistan , because he believes that women are equal to men .
What she said is that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 , without having a say .
I am sorry that she has not expressed it sufficiently eloqu@@ ently for you .
It may seem contradictory , but perhaps she would say that if her father had not given him freedom , she would have been married at 14 years of age .
Rather than this season ’ s 4 entry into season and especially from J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , which clearly finds it difficult to find her S@@ so@@ y Di@@ e@@ tr@@ ich character .
I have just looked at the two modern seas@@ ons that are quite different , but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series , one of the most successful .
A fascin@@ ating first episo@@ de .
The achievement is close to perfec@@ tion , and J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ’ s S@@ ho@@ w sing the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on M@@ ars is simply over@@ turning .
I have not yet looked at this new season ( which will be the last for me without Lange ) .
In the case of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r St@@ ory , I would have preferred to have seen 13 episo@@ des of 3-@@ 4 months .
But one thing is on , outside the extraordinary J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , that is above all the sc@@ are@@ -@@ mon@@ g@@ ering and the mountains that I see .
In A@@ H@@ S , we have an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans that makes no la@@ ugh@@ ing stock of today ’ s as@@ simil@@ ation of today ’ s production .
It is quite clear to me that you are throwing up the clock for the next season without even waiting to be able to gau@@ ge quality .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange is certainly a pillar of this series , but , as you so rightly say , there are many other things .
It is quite simply that for me J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ( and , above all , her way and the way she uses it ) , really is the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities .
And good bas@@ h is a great deal for her .
Then I find that the series of reports , in writing , wants to do too much at the same time .
The 3 was slightly below , in the 2 that was too sc@@ attered , despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I see them not to make 10 seas@@ ons of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r St@@ ory or to end up like 24 hours chron@@ ically .
But everyone will do what they want to do !
It is with what I say ‘ I shall no longer look at ’ that everyone is obliged to do the same !
I simply share my point of view , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , J@@ E believes it will be fatal .
But after that , that is just my opinion .
Let us talk less about tax increases , please - let us look rather at state spending .
No , let us increase spending please .
Those who wanted to sab@@ otage the expenditure failed .
C@@ le@@ asing po@@ le@@ m@@ ics about relatively small items of expenditure , such as development aid
The problem is that it is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to want , and during all that time some , on both sides , pretend that these nu@@ ances are far more important and substantial than they are – and voters see in their game and find them . bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of expenditure .
“ debt ” is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country .
The “ debt ” is nothing to worry about .
I would see no problem in the government approaching a third of my income ( even before talking about consumer taxes ) if I thought it would use it properly .
But that is not the case , and many taxpayers have the same feeling .
It is said that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age was not quite honest about how to cut taxes , but good , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development aid , Hi@@ gh S@@ pain@@ ed 2 , subsidies for roughly useless wind tur@@ b@@ ines and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they do . You should arrive at a figure that makes Labour and L@@ ub@@ -@@ De@@ m tax quite ridiculous on the most luc@@ rative homes .
Your first GBP 10 000 is not tax@@ able .
This means that someone who ear@@ ns £ 35 000 per year will pay around £ 5 000 ( one seventh of their salary ) , someone with £ 50 000 would pay around £ 10@@ ,000 ( one-@@ fifth ) , and someone with £ 200 000 would pay around £ 70 000 ( just over a third ) .
And social security contributions ?
The more social contributions , the more local taxes , the more the car par@@ king costs and the car stic@@ ker , and it is before VAT .
Almost exactly 30 % of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car stic@@ ker .
I am paid in a decent way , but not in an extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant way .
Not that this is a problem , of course , I am happy to pay my taxes .
But let us not pretend that money falls from the sky , or that it is not important to know where billions of p@@ ounds of tax p@@ ounds spend .
How can an unemployed person seeking work prove that ?
Even so , 20 % of the unemployed would not want to seek and find 80 % of the unemployed .
As I myself am unemployed , do I have more interest in what others are seeking or not ?
Whether a potential recru@@ it@@ er gets 10 or 20 C@@ V@@ s , that bo@@ des well for my chances .
Indeed , I have not had any news from Po@@ le Employment for months , that means that the agents are more busy monitoring operations than really getting announ@@ cements of employment back home ?
I do not see the interest .
Because it is not up to the state to deliver work .
If Po@@ le Employment does not provide enough jobs , then we must do without Po@@ le Employment .
What is a sensitive issue ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case ensuring that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights .
Just as a contro@@ ller calls for their transport title to users of a transport medium , a Head of Service or the employees of them for their work , etc .
No one is sh@@ ou@@ ting at the scandal in these cases , not ?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights : the only two times when I had to deal with Po@@ le Employment , my ARE rights had been poorly established , and on one of the dossiers , am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated by 40 % , it was necessary to fight hard .
It takes time !
I am not an expert in law .
Tr@@ ust and control are taking hold at the moment , while stat@@ ure Po@@ le Employment is close to being , in fact , an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only apply to employees , it is they who pay the con@@ secu@@ tive areas .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans and French politicians have rights that they have not in fact !
That is not normal .
I would add that worthy unemployment insurance contributes to the enhan@@ cement of paid work .
More than just waiting for mur@@ der@@ ous tw@@ e@@ ets in Arab@@ ic ...
In fact , there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria , which will stop I@@ sis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would then resemb@@ le the spread of black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with war and population movements at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is had the spirit of banning H@@ ad@@ j this year in M@@ ec@@ ca to Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms from the three affected countries .
El P@@ was reports that 7 400 have been refused visa applications because of their country of origin or their recent travel .
In fact , there was the case of a pil@@ gri@@ m in Bosnia who contr@@ acted the vari@@ o@@ le to M@@ ec@@ ca during the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980 ’ s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m in Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same presence .
Is it to be my heart to propose preventing E@@ bol@@ a su@@ ffe@@ rers from taking a plane for Europe ?
I thought it was simple sense , but apparently those &apos; who know &apos; have decided that we can risk the lives of tens of thousands of people ...
These West African countries where E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be strictly quar@@ ant@@ ined .
No one is out of it .
Only health workers can enter .
21 days of waiting after dealing with patients before they can go .
If they contract E@@ bol@@ a while they are there , they remain there until they are heal@@ ed .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Last week alone , people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa even though they had taken &apos; all the necessary precautions &apos; .
The progress of this disease can be stopped .
It spre@@ ads mainly by airlines .
Let us stop offering them to fly to these countries .
Moreover , customs officers at airports should be trained to spot the typical symptoms of E@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be put in quar@@ ant@@ ine immediately .
Whether he can get the message from the first person and from the group ( including religious ) is second and he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt whether he will be able to erec@@ t as dogma the image of God characterised by the total cor@@ tex of the planet in operation .
It is still a long way from that view .
It has only been 20 years since the information came to be seen as the given premium for humanity , while religion , which came out of the cer@@ vel@@ let , is leading our actions since Luc@@ y perhaps .
What is the point of becoming the ump@@ teenth Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who have not noticed , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely minority in France today , no one is forced to join .
W@@ ho@@ ever critici@@ zes the Church in any way would see the small number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France in any case .
What is the next step , we are removing the concept of sin , which is too &apos; anxiety &apos; ?
@ le@@ an : S@@ or@@ ry the church does not have a limited vision of France .
And , throughout the world , this will enable us to reach more people ...
@ Mar@@ tine E , to be honest ( as usual ) respect for others as you envisaged it to be at the hel@@ m .
H@@ ill@@ el a century before he said : &apos; don &apos;t do to others what you do not want to do , that is the Tor@@ ah as a whole , and the rest is only comment : go and study ! &apos;
Christianity goes far beyond simply reciprocity , but introduces the ag@@ ap@@ se .
Your &apos; progress towards justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity &apos; , but without God ?
It is a return to Communism ?
The next step is to remove the embo@@ di@@ ment of inc@@ ar@@ nation and resur@@ rec@@ tion .
Je@@ sus will remain the her@@ o that over@@ turned moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be ready to play their part in the ethical debates of our societies and bring justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity .
Not very Catholic ?
I think I remember that the small number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France is mainly due to the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and forced into immigration a few centuries ago .
I hesitate to buy that , the new relationship , or W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 .
And the new E@@ li@@ te game will soon emerge .
That is not the way to do things .
Personally , I would like to choose So@@ ves .
I like W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 ( I even participated in his fund campaign ) , but I do not think that there is 30 £ 30 .
If you are interested in the P@@ C version of which you are interested , Green M@@ an M@@ an G@@ ing currently sel@@ ls S@@ M to 30 and also proposes a good 20 % reduction .
Green M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing currently sel@@ ls S@@ M to £ 30 and also proposes a 20 % reduction .
I am going to look at it .
Obviously not work .
The hard@@ ships in the computer department are blocking all sites .
Good morning , is it £ 30 and 20 % reduction , or does the 30 include the 20 % reduction ?
Let us be careful , however : the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
It sur@@ prises me , I bought it , but it cannot do it .
In addition , I bought him on Ste@@ am , so no reimbursement is zero .
It is time for a new video card to be bought into the ro@@ of .
It is a Brazilian site , but you get a Ste@@ am identi@@ fi@@ er who , I believe , is valid .

Of £ 3@@ 60 for P@@ C , £ 35 for X@@ bo@@ x 3@@ 60 and P@@ S@@ 3 , 44 for X@@ bo@@ x and P@@ S@@ 4 .

So please join the B@@ et@@ ta version of E@@ li@@ te : D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
So , was France a &apos; pu@@ tri@@ d breeding ground &apos; in 19@@ 40 ?
T@@ ell me , therefore , that Nobel Prize winner seems to me to be a pois@@ oned ch@@ al@@ ice .
We need to love the French of 40 , that of &apos; strange defeat &apos; ?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature , you wonder whether P@@ rou@@ st or Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
Nobel is not even an event , and one does not even want to read the cul@@ pr@@ its .
Brazili@@ ans , Chinese , or Austr@@ ali@@ ans will read Mo@@ di@@ ano , who is already hard to read in French , and who describes such a limited and ha@@ ck@@ ne@@ yed uni@@ verse ?
I hope that the other No@@ els are more credible but , frankly , I doubt it .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , is a distant report with literature .
Have you read it at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize winner ?
It would be better to judge .
The Chinese , the Brazili@@ ans and others do not worry for them .
ali@@ ens are very sensitive to French literature and culture .
They will be able to appreciate Mr President .
If they are already aware of this , they are well aware of it !
For your part , please continue to attend L@@ é@@ v@@ y and Mus@@ sol@@ o .
I agree with you .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me Mus@@ sol@@ o retain all their chances .
So let us see who won the Nobel Prize for literature : H@@ . H@@ .

E@@ ver since I started one in Iceland , I have not seen K@@ ia S@@ port@@ age everywhere .
I believe that this has followed me up to now .

Good morning , always hatred ?
Good morning - no , not today , I have made my med@@ als .
That is Wednesday !
I have had a few days of rest .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val of beer and the ci@@ der of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was a bo@@ g@@ us .
I have managed to disgu@@ ise 19 beer , as W@@ ob@@ b@@ y We@@ a@@ sel is one of my fav@@ our@@ ite .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mi@@ xing of people there , but there was no such thing as CAM@@ A fana@@ tics ( not to be confused with the fana@@ tics of the cam@@ era ) .
D@@ ri@@ ving back on Sunday was really hard .
On Monday night , you went to the grand@@ father of a po@@ t to play n@@ ud@@ g .
Thanks to a genuine beginning opportunity , I have been able to go back to a number of decent ones .
I hope that if I arrive at 95 years I will be as lively as he is .
Last night I went to a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils bar in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my be@@ ver@@ ages came with a slic@@ e of head@@ ard .
I ad@@ mire Mr
Re@@ ad a little Bou@@ d@@ d@@ ha and you will understand how wrong it is , Mr Christian .
Having said that , I do not think you are going to be against you , but I think you are going a little further away .
It all banned the qu@@ e@@ ues for ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts from leaving the mo@@ squ@@ es .
It mentions arms trafficking without delay .
Either we have great open eyes like Med@@ de@@ b and Tai@@ a or Bou@@ ba@@ ker or we have our eyes closed .
We have to choose .
It is not by keeping the eyes closed that one gets light .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , Mr Christian , but once again you are making a monu@@ mental counter-@@ sense : all the authorities , organisations or associations representative , Muslim or non-@@ Muslim , having formally condemned the IS and its crimes , the French , Muslim or otherwise , have nothing to add to these unanimous official condem@@ nations .
Anyone who does not say word is con@@ don@@ ing .
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims , Arab or African .
Not like the French .
Unfortunately , there is a great deal of doubt for everyone , Mr Mer@@ v@@ or .
As I said a thousand times , some doubt the Jews &apos; approval of Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be fool@@ ish and fool@@ ish to accuse them pri@@ ori and demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it .
In my opinion , this principle is the neg@@ ation of the Republic and can only help to de@@ t@@ ach French society .
I do not think there is any doubt about that .
Who does not say word , but what ?
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t with I@@ I or the conviction of E@@ I .
silence is a good thing , it is the main weapon of those who want to keep the go@@ at and the fo@@ x .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but prag@@ matically untenable .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , during the elections , “ reven@@ ge ” parties represented at West@@ min@@ ster because a huge gap has wi@@ dened between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum .
Cameron must be pe@@ tri@@ fied to lose all these seats in West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must lau@@ gh .
What is these threats ?
Conservatives ride rou@@ gh@@ sh@@ od over Scotland , because they have no basis for it .
They can do what they want with electoral impunity .
I do not think that Cameron even is fool@@ ish enough to believe that the L@@ ab@@ our losing seats in West@@ min@@ ster for the benefit of the S@@ N@@ P is good for him and the Conservatives in the long run .
Who is going to hand over a weapon for the Labour Party .
They will be fully disposed of in Scotland by the S@@ N@@ P and UK@@ IP , which will cut their heads in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ band joined the so-called &apos; PR@@ M@@ ES@@ S@@ ES@@ S@@ O &apos; thinking that he was res@@ cu@@ ing his party but without realising that he was signing the death c@@ ess@@ ation of his Scottish Members .
No wonder some Labour MEPs call for accountability to their leader .
If the S@@ N@@ P ear@@ ns 20-@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if seats do not come from the Conservatives , then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for them . Ma@@ x@@ imum decentralisation .
I believe that this is the important thing .
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected in England one day .
C@@ p@@ um@@ ps of 8 % at the expense of 85 % , it is not a sup@@ er electoral strategy .
In addition , once Scottish MEPs will no longer be able to vote on matters relating to England , the Conservatives will win all the votes .
O@@ h , I think it is .
Perhaps Cameron has little to lose , but M@@ ili@@ band should be .
Mag@@ gi@@ e has done this with the Ul@@ ster Uni@@ onists and it has been successful .
But he is still in power to be prime minister in 2015 , and that since he won the Lab@@ or Party leadership .
So , basically , these bo@@ xes will virtually be behind every read@@ er to look over his shoulders and see what he reads , how he reads , and how to end .
It is ‘ The life of the others ’ from East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B applied to the world of F@@ R@@ I@@ C ...
Again the same fasc@@ ination for surveillance techniques .
Ultimately , this will at least have a ster@@ il@@ ous effect .
I await the next ticket : Ama@@ z@@ on manufacturing V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E , according to V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E profile , and this automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of its secrecy !
This is a ga@@ un@@ tle@@ t for the world .
Str@@ ic@@ tly stimul@@ ated .
Thank you for the article .
As under this system , the management of the D@@ R@@ M@@ s has not been imp@@ aired , but it remains for me to read the pir@@ ated files , public books or purchased from a few publ@@ ish@@ ers who have the intelligence to propose files without ke@@ y@@ ers .
Given the price that I paid for the K@@ ob@@ o , that is without regret .
I am ast@@ ounded by the widespread ab@@ dic@@ ation of users in the face of widespread ownership of their privacy .
In your general public release , you will always notice that everyone gives his fi@@ de@@ lity card ( fe@@ u@@ n o@@ sten@@ c , &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 160 ; ... ) .
There are also demanding ma@@ ster@@ pieces whose opening and completion rates are undoubtedly der@@ is@@ ory .
For example , James Jo@@ e ’ s “ Fin@@ n@@ an W@@ ak@@ e . ”
@ Thomas : in the Bi@@ g D@@ at@@ a era , the data does not really need to be personal in order to be relevant .
Let us be careful not to put all the literature into the same bas@@ ement .
The har@@ vest@@ ing of an@@ onymous data when there is a profile ... .
The harvest is not an@@ onymous .
It is the data published by K@@ ob@@ o , which is not allowed to identify the read@@ ers or the authors .
But K@@ ob@@ o has all this information .
There have been so many exaggerated , er@@ ron@@ eous and contradictory statements on the part of the Turkish Government over the last few days that the country seems to be headed by a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten with sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ran@@ ges .
This is even worse if you take Er@@ dog@@ an ’ s religious fundamentalism into account .
It is interesting that some of Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s supporters believe that Islamist is such an insult that they are removing your comment , but not mine .
Well , we have seen , but Turkey does not want to sho@@ ot itself in the foot unless there is anything to gain from it .
If it attacks I@@ SIS , I@@ SIS will retali@@ ate , so it is actually sho@@ oting itself in the foot .
A reti@@ red diplom@@ at on his blo@@ g : “ The A@@ P reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be wrong to seek to over@@ throw Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad , because that would jeopardise Israel ’ s security .
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retali@@ ation or whether it simply advised caution .
This second option is more likely and , in any case , what is really surprising is that Iran ’ s and American diplomatic engagement today concerns Syria , Israel , and the security of the region . ”
The Indi@@ an P@@ un@@ ch@@ line reading is to recommend strongly to anyone that attention should be paid to the details rather than to the traditional media led by the traditional media ; the short article you give is important and should be read bearing in mind the realistic comments / warnings / warnings from Iran to offer from Iran to Afghanistan . In 1979 - 1980 .
Who are these “ moder@@ ates ” who seriously combat the horrific secular Assad and the per@@ ver@@ ts of I@@ SIS ?
The policy of pipelines push@@ es the world into ab@@ me , and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent &apos; moder@@ ates &apos; to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War .
“ It is even worse than that if you take Er@@ dog@@ an ’ s religious fundamentalism into account ’ there are other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?
I have one in mind .
We need a N@@ u@@ rem@@ berg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks .
What is to be done ?
You realise that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of still living ?
A little late for that , my po@@ t ...
Are criminals not just old now , like 120 years ?
A little late for that , no ?
Particularly with regard to the C@@ U@@ P tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate which planned and directed the genocide , T@@ al@@ a@@ at and D@@ j@@ em@@ al , killed just after the 1@@ st World War by reven@@ ge by the Armen@@ ians , and killed by the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks in a pa@@ med place of the Central Asia at roughly the same time , when it dre@@ am@@ t that it would base a Turkish empire on it .
What a de@@ ar@@ th !
An impressive ma@@ ster@@ y of the fall@@ acy of fatal sl@@ op@@ es , but , apart from that , it is in vain to seek contact with the real .

What a shame it is to designate them as future psychological im@@ balancing .
One day , they will have the right to defend themselves , to say they are happy to live , to earn their living and to pay the pension for this lad@@ y ( ? )
The G@@ PA is without doubt a temporary &apos; solution &apos; in the evolution of medicine in our world .
It is not a date of today .
Many women brought children who were not of their hus@@ ban@@ ds to the world .
This is still the case , so we are in this way ...
What is important here is that this practice is controlled so that the &apos; commerci@@ alisation &apos; of the body is limited .
But cosmetic sur@@ ger@@ y , cosmetics , are not as commerci@@ alised as bodies ?

It is certainly more e@@ leg@@ ant to make a good in a distant country via the Internet and P@@ ay P@@ al more than to shoulder its responsibilities and to avoid the scandal in another centuries close to home without sh@@ ou@@ ting it at that time on all the ro@@ of@@ s !
Moreover , these practices were not made on behalf of the church ! ...
It is not just Christians and beli@@ ever@@ s who reject these practices ...
The fact remains that the exploitation of bodies is a real problem .

I believe that in the sports section there is an article on football which awa@@ its your comments .
A very true article , a very true one .
Since Tony Par@@ son ’ s film , there has been a shortage of reports that genuinely reflect the reality of North England ’ s culture .
No wonder Paul Ma@@ son has gras@@ ped the social and political context , he understands it well .
Northern Ireland still lives , but it has been v@@ am@@ ic@@ ised by capitalism , and today it is essentially a phenomenon of surface area .
Having said that , you can listen to it if you are in the London region in November : 9@@ 9@@ p@@ sou@@ l will once again pass from the vin@@ y@@ les of sou@@ l , including the Northern sou@@ ls , on Saturday 15 November to the B@@ et@@ se@@ y Tro@@ wood in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .

It is clear that R@@ ab@@ in , Netanyahu and their voters all preferred the settlement to peace .
He clo@@ ses his clo@@ thes , post@@ ers on the ro@@ ck and goes into the water .

It is just a sequ@@ ence of personal attacks and ins@@ in@@ uations ( my 13 year-old daughter likes it well , which means that it is a question of im@@ maturity ) .
A truly vicious burden , with just a suspicion that Rus@@ sell Br@@ and says some tru@@ ths , perhaps tru@@ ths to which we prefer not to think .
It is going to be more and more widespread !
I can understand why B@@ lan@@ and horri@@ fied some : he sometimes speaks pre@@ ten@@ ously and after all the nonsense of t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids he gives the impression of being a beg@@ g@@ ar-@@ th@@ y-@@ neighb@@ or , but the whole story of not voting has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my view .
The general consensus seems to be that he is right to say just to people not to vote and to sit back and to ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview with P@@ x@@ man and other vide@@ os he raised , he said that voting once every five years for the L@@ . ab@@ our or Conservatives ( or D@@ D@@ D@@ D@@ s , I suppose ) and limit democratic engagement to this is completely useless , both parties ( to slightly different degrees ) governed mainly in favour of special interests , multinational companies and the rich , and at no time does he say that he is completely ignoring politics because these parties are party to the parties . It does not govern on our behalf : it insists that rather than just voting and dis@@ connec@@ ting itself for five years , people should become much more active politically at local level , organise movements , demonstrations , petitions , regardless of whether and try to influence politics from that .
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution ( because I believe that being politically active by presenting his requests can go hand in hand with voting , given that politicians are gi@@ f@@ ts that will change their minds if they really risk losing elections ) , but it is not good to see all these answers . It is pat@@ ron@@ ising that this i@@ dio@@ tic , which makes Je@@ sus say to young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it really is distorted his arguments .
His solution is highly questionable , and it would be good if people were to debate what he actually says rather than just labelling it as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind .
Yes , thank you .
The rig@@ mar@@ o@@ le on the vote was completely distorted .
I am deeply anno@@ yed about the fact that my vote really does not count for nothing .
I want more referenda , electronic voting , direct democracy and Members who are accountable to their constituents locally .
In addition , I dispute the idea that the words of Rus@@ sell B@@ and are not his own ( written by others ) .
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas , even if they are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-@@ culture thin@@ kers and aca@@ demics that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne would like to bring together under the label “ p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ sts . ”
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would be able to convince Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne .
Perhaps that is what the Guar@@ dian could do , whether Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne does like Pol@@ ly To@@ y@@ n@@ be@@ e and interview Rus@@ sell on a v@@ and@@ age , with even r@@ ank ho@@ o@@ ks being added to the world !
Like Ma@@ x K@@ e@@ is@@ er , who initially attacked Rus@@ sel but ended up becoming one of his f@@ ans , and urged him to do so , it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants .
It has run into a political dis@@ course that has existed for generations but has been marginalised by traditional media - including the Guar@@ dian - for generations .
This “ fron@@ t@@ loading ” shows , above all , that the intellectual debate ’ s history has long been held in history ’ s R@@ D@@ V@@ s , where professional histor@@ ians have become a minority , and that exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of the kind of par@@ den@@ sed con@@ den@@ sed media .
For my part , I saw in Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ e@@ u &apos;s intellectual behavior as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need to blame one , a scapego@@ at .
They develop some very rational arguments , but this ration@@ ality is based on these scapego@@ ats , who are the ke@@ y@@ stone of their thinking .
Rather , I believe that for F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , the state was indispensable as a cul@@ pri@@ t .
This is very ar@@ cha@@ ic thinking , the thinking sacrificed , which is also the magic thought .
The problem in the report is solved by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ istic sl@@ ope , neo-@@ li@@ b and / or liber@@ tarian ( in both terms marks a tightening of the state ’ s desire for eradication , the first knowing how to seek state aid for its markets ) in the sense of the least state / not of any state at all at F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ol@@ o ’ s level . There is no doubt about that .
The self-@@ defe@@ ating dream of the self-@@ indul@@ gent base is the old dream .
His thinking is built on the cul@@ p@@ ability of the state : without guilt she does not hold on to it .
The cul@@ pri@@ t says disposal , murder , sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
Nor is there any need for support .
The totalitarian Left remember the good old times , that of its then go@@ d , Stalin , the small father of the people .
O@@ ul@@ ala , you probably read too quickly if you took F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult ’ s texts on Iran ’ s revolution for K@@ home@@ ini ’ s apo@@ logy .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ ent would no longer be am@@ using Michel in this way ...
G@@ au@@ chet is thinking deeply about the contemporary person and the collective , about the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether one agrees with him or not , he is an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
To see this cab@@ al or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by human scienti@@ st scientists from the left , who do not bear the br@@ unt of al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ as , is lau@@ g@@ hable enough .
The nar@@ c@@ is@@ is@@ me and the author@@ itarianism of these people are lim@@ it@@ less .
One important point to add seems to me to be the position of these &apos; rebels &apos; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of the Chinese and other &apos; y@@ el@@ low &apos; which I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You did not have the pleasure of hearing our Austr@@ ali@@ an friends on this subject , then .
And where was it in Russia that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I do not remember when I last saw a Chinese .
In London , they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time , in a market .
The Chinese think like the white man !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and from Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou a long time ago , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them viol@@ ently anti-@@ B@@ lan@@ k .
My father is not happy that his el@@ dest daughter was born with a B@@ lan@@ c .
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and above all in recent years : they are getting richer , prosperity is spreading outside the major cities , and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live .
In particular , the Russians have prejudices against temporary workers who are un@@ qualified from the Caucasus and Central Asia , who work in professions and in areas where they are lucky enough to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence .
Although I have lived on the shores of the River I@@ en@@ is@@ se@@ i in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
Unfortunately , I heard the views of Austr@@ ali@@ ans on the Chinese and the A@@ ori@@ gen@@ s .
It is truly bizarre that a foreign@@ er tells me that I do not support the Chinese , while I have met two in my life ( including one abroad ) , all people are equally worthy and , in fact , those of London have been very kind and , in fact , the only ones in London have been very kind . That is why I remembered that they were Chinese .
Otherwise we will not remember who is meeting , all people are worth remembering , how to remember who was who was .
Do you know what is bizarre ?
That you and the other Russian are talking about Chinese as a kind of unique fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attr@@ action in a zo@@ o .
And yet you are still coming out of it .
How many Chinese men are with white men in comparison ?
None of them , because there is a great deal of chance that the parents of those lan@@ ded in the White Paper would aggressive them to the P@@ Y@@ Y@@ S@@ ME@@ N@@ T .
No measure of the fairness of justice .
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipul@@ ated by strong left-wing groups like the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy ’ s trade union …
This is a case of for@@ gi@@ veness , but the judicial circles are , frankly , a right .
When the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy &apos;s Sy@@ n@@ ergy , only 25 % of judges are returned .
If a measure of its bias can be made on the basis of the rela@@ tivity of the application of laws in the courts , it requires two obstacles to be removed .
The one is the political vision of the observer , such as that of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate ’ s factual interpretation .
It then remains the mandatory tool of law to re@@ focus the assessment on fundamentals .
The extent to which it is observed in all the judicial acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , included , forces a distinction to be drawn between the error and the partiality of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates .
It would be fu@@ tile to claim that acts of justice are not divided between these three groups .
D@@ er@@ og@@ ation and ignorance does not fall within the scope of an objective analysis .
So , if all of this is not analysed , how can it be said that justice is improving in France ?
If it is only through statistics that it implic@@ itly starts from a very low level .
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio .
The issue of corruption in the judiciary of the judiciary .
This is a sensitive issue in proportion to the power of nu@@ is@@ ance that is given to the judicial institution that is capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The area considered is that of the des@@ pat@@ ch of he@@ irs to procedure by means of procedural sc@@ ams , which have been man@@ dated by no@@ tar@@ o@@ gy@@ ists man@@ dated by no@@ tar@@ ies .
This profession gets EUR 150 million an year while , at the same time , it has the right to cover the relevant coverage by the qu@@ asi@@ -@@ judicial impunity of the French no@@ vel@@ ty .
For the understanding of their mechanism , part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication .
Where it is in line with the moderate statistical improvement in the previous com@@ mentary , it is that the judicial institution has produced , in many disputes between gener@@ al@@ og@@ ist and inher@@ it@@ ance inher@@ it@@ ance , a whole series of cases of case law that goes against all the laws that favour he@@ irs .
Is it not the case that the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria is not a cra@@ f@@ ted form of lie ?
Surely prices are absolutely prohibi@@ tive .
Yet again , equipment to s@@ na@@ p people with disabilities .
This can be said , but my bro@@ ther has one of those tri@@ f@@ les every field , buil@@ ds on his size and weight , and has really made it possible for him to enjoy the full air as never a normal whe@@ el@@ chair , with whe@@ eled and cumbersome ty@@ res and ty@@ res .
As we say , the g@@ ates and the col@@ ours ...
T@@ an@@ k@@ ch@@ ai@@ ri resemb@@ les what Je@@ re@@ my C@@ lar@@ k@@ son could invent for a challenge in T@@ op Ge@@ ar .
T@@ ack@@ air has E@@ P@@ I@@ EU air .
I believe that the inven@@ tor of the W@@ h@@ ill has never had to clean up a dog cr@@ ack on a ch@@ ink .
I am sure that my s@@ ister would love the tri@@ round every ground , but it is simply too expensive .
The whe@@ el@@ chair of ul@@ tr@@ a long distance would be perfect for a disabled person with a long-@@ distance pen@@ ch@@ ant .
There are h@@ ills here .
P@@ ric@@ es seem to be high , but there are real people who make such prices in a bic@@ ycle , so “ you see . ”
The tri@@ fec@@ ycle seems to me to be particularly useful .
Not all disabled people are poor , however .
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance .
Only if they have become disabled .
The ru@@ b is that the whe@@ el@@ chair market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford to practise high prices for things that they know they need .
It cannot really be said that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
This is an example of excessive design .
Unfortunately , this is just a ske@@ t@@ ch , it is not planned to produce it .
I am CO@@ NT@@ N@@ T that the long-@@ distance whe@@ el@@ chair does not arrive on the market , because apparently there is no way to drive this tr@@ ick rig@@ ged .
Almost 20 000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza , during intensive bombing of den@@ sely populated residential areas .
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 ( Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory , not Egypt ) .
Hal@@ f of these are children and young people who are under 18 years of age .
Children of eight years have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade !

Pri@@ m@@ ary and Pop@@ ul@@ ist Re@@ action
In fact , we do not know too much what Mar@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see that ?
Because the Germans have refused to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I am not sure that Spe@@ e really did “ refuse ” to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ si@@ sia in his book &quot; C@@ ast@@ le of Ste@@ el &quot; suggests that Spe@@ e quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating British co@@ o@@ king in the area .
The sea was heated at the beginning of the day ; I do not know whether this was still the case at the end of the battle ?
Likewise , the struggle ended after sin@@ king from the sun , making rescue operations more difficult .
Comp@@ are this with the next battle , that of the Fal@@ k@@ lands , where , on the photo@@ graph@@ s showing the survi@@ v@@ ors who are being res@@ cu@@ ed , we see a calm sea in full day .
Moreover , the res@@ cu@@ ers knew that there were no German fighters at this stage .
H@@ um@@ m does not really correspond to what I remember reading this battle , so I made a quick research on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a :
“ There was some confusion among German vessels about the fate of the two gre@@ edy cr@@ us@@ ers , who had disappeared into the dark after stopping the sho@@ oting , and a cur@@ se began .
The L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g lives on fire , but when he comes closer to him he lives that it was only a wrec@@ k .
The N@@ ü@@ r@@ berg , slower than other German vessels , joined the late battle and lives on Mon@@ mo@@ th , which has been severely damaged and damaged , but still on the move .
Having pointed out its spot@@ light on the ship &apos;s flag , the proposal to go was refused and it opened the boat , finally sin@@ king the ship .
Un@@ reliable information , von Spe@@ e ju@@ ge@@ a , that the Go@@ o@@ d H@@ ope had to escape and arrested the research at 10.@@ 15 p.m.
What he said about the reports of a British cu@@ re@@ au@@ x in the surrounding area , he got to the north &apos; .
So , if it is true , Germans , in the dark before the ra@@ d@@ ar invention was invented , did not know that a ship had sun@@ k , so it could not look for survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also thought that there was a more important co@@ o@@ king of the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y in the area that could have seriously damaged the damage , so in confusion they are disgu@@ sting to take advantage of their advance .
They were far from their base , and Spe@@ e was aware that they should find their way through many Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y vessels .
C@@ ra@@ do@@ ck ’ s sacrifice had already caused them to harm them and accounted for about half of their am@@ muni@@ tion , thereby condemning them when they were finally taken .
There are a number of voices in the U@@ M@@ P calling for it to be written into the law that a definitively convicted elected person is therefore permanently in@@ eligible .
This is a courageous position , which would also affect the left-wing Members of the House .

When will trade unions be banned in sectors that are already protected ?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens ?
As society ’ s vision is limited to these sectors , whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , which are always quick to am@@ pli@@ fy those who will benefit from their in@@ am@@ ity to obstruc@@ t the actions of the real policies , who are really trying to get things moving , not the fine words that are spoken about . The lack of action is commensurate with their complac@@ ency .

It would not defend the same thes@@ es if right-wing , or even far-@@ right , unions were targeted for person@@ alities on its board and against a judicial and media war .
Your statements are completely free of charge .
If , at the moment , the right is def@@ ying the current legal situation , it is simply that it has committed something to do with it !
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with the justice system , but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated in favour of it .
On the other hand , we must also remember that the union of the left-wing mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and a minority .
For a minister to support the trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be .
The union that you mention is perhaps a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but it has a great influence on the Chancellor , which is no secret .
One now won@@ ders whether the &apos; mission &apos; of certain judges is not more dirty rather than being educated .

It is worse than ridiculous : it sets a completely artificial distance between the western public and the people who have been studied – distance that is relatively short of racism , because the sac@@ r@@ alistic eth@@ os present us with these distant people like infin@@ ite super@@ sti@@ tious and rit@@ ual bi@@ go@@ try , while most of them do so . ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to our own and , like ours , inspired by practical considerations on a daily basis .
Unless you interpret the situation un@@ wisely in the opposite direction .
Either , but rather than saying that the fan@@ fare is un@@ sac@@ red , is it not better to admit that our Mari@@ ann@@ e and our M@@ ol@@ ers do not have a rather sac@@ red character ?
Our bias is , as pointed out , to see sac@@ red as a kind of well-@@ defined object and circum@@ s@@ cri@@ bed to the religious sphere .
That is very interesting in any case .
It is of the de@@ ec@@ o ep@@ h@@ em@@ he@@ re to keep a vacuum .

There have been F@@ 1 con@@ spir@@ acies , but never one that puts Commissioners at risk of death for a long history of the possibility of a pilot ’ s victory to the detriment of another .
It is not the F@@ O@@ M that is out of the ba@@ g because it is F@@ I@@ A .
There is a great deal to be said for this .
In view of am@@ ate@@ urs ’ am@@ ate@@ ur@@ ish images , the F@@ I@@ A above all means avoiding the troub@@ ling questions of the type : How is it that the Commissioner ag@@ it@@ ates a green flag in intervention and continues to do so after the accident ( see the video complete after the accident ) ?
No , it is not because the video is deemed to be too violent for F@@ IA to block the images of the accident , but because one of the Commissioners is clearly a green flag , a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under the y@@ el@@ low flag regime .
Some comments show a dark ignorance of F@@ 1 .
Yes , E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , the race is no longer under the umbrella of J@@ PA A@@ P@@ ES as the place of the accident , hence the green flag .
That is the usual procedure .

Before I thought that the media was an integral part of the government &apos;s &apos; patri@@ otic &apos; propaganda offensive , I am afraid that , ultimately , it is just for money .
And sex , let us not forget , the fear of not having sexual life , the pu@@ b and the media are good enough to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sex life .
In@@ fec@@ ts do exactly the same thing .
En@@ tering bu@@ z@@ z with inf@@ os that we really do not need to care about is just to continue to fear people so that they can continue to control them .
“ When the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids affect E@@ bol@@ a , we all make every effort to “ der@@ ail ” it should be “ der@@ ail@@ ed , ” not “ tou@@ ch@@ ingly ” .
Given the medical reference , “ breaking ” is much better said in this context than “ der@@ ail@@ ing . ”
I wonder whether all the people who are dist@@ ressing that E@@ bol@@ a could start to spread by air realise that they now believe in developments ?
You give them too much honour .
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that E@@ bol@@ a is just one of the signs of apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se that is approaching .
E@@ bol@@ a it is the An@@ t@@ ch@@ ris@@ t !
You confuse E@@ bol@@ a and Mur@@ do@@ ch ...
Pro@@ per Rule , thank you !
A short and conc@@ ise article that makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of this des@@ pic@@ able p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ journ@@ alism .
That was a very good thing for me to say .
It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media are talking about most things with this attitude of optimism .
Once again , the goal is to keep ourselves frigh@@ tened and frigh@@ tened ( without hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to der@@ ail us when it needs it .
I believe it is perfectly logical that , if we are to suffer a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack , why not have a crisis in E@@ bol@@ a without any proven cases ?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself invented .
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations on this post , and to be still with this world almost 35 years later .
At the beginning it had to be horrific , given the context of the 198@@ 0-@@ 90 years .
I am b@@ lu@@ ff@@ ed , live with the certainty of going through it for years … .@@ .
It is completely unnecessary .
As always , when we talk about science .
Not only does the testi@@ mony of evidence serve no purpose : it cannot be used as a scientific material .
But they have a detrimental effect on objective assessment of the facts .
Tra@@ di@@ tions : testi@@ monies cannot be used as a scientific material .
That is perhaps why we are refra@@ ining from putting questions to patients in psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry when there are reliable observations from the relatives .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric dossier mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t explains that I have been tele@@ ph@@ oned by her mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
This is therefore an objective symp@@ tom .
When I say that this is a matter of subjec@@ tive testi@@ mony , it is not important .
A@@ h , because the at@@ te@@ station of a fact ( which is the testi@@ mony of this testi@@ mony , which testi@@ fies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments ) serves no purpose in a scientific approach ?
So what do you base the research on , then ?
On fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es ?
Are you putting fan@@ ci@@ ful the@@ ories and facts at the same level , which give rise to veri@@ fiable testi@@ monies ) ?
“ Re@@ si@@ li@@ ence ” : the “ Bi@@ b@@ lical ” word by J@@ -@@ L Del@@ ar@@ ue ’ s f@@ ans , f@@ ans , who take for great psycho@@ log@@ ists after reading D ’ an@@ gu@@ ur@@ g .
@ J@@ im : there is full sense of bo@@ g@@ us bu@@ ts .

As it is a great scienti@@ st , C@@ yr@@ ul@@ ni@@ k , I hope that he will have co@@ b@@ b@@ led together a reliable scale of measu@@ rement to quanti@@ fy it , that famous resili@@ ence .
I wonder whether air S@@ enti@@ ls could all rescue us from Far@@ age and airline ?
Do you not think of Te@@ am America ?
Str@@ ic@@ tly speaking , it is not a good idea to take a good look at a good idea to highlight the S@@ in@@ n@@ ell@@ es of the air ...
Why , then ?
It was a brilliant series , and it would seem that those who emerge from it are aware of it !
So let us leave our sal@@ vation to the all-@@ powerful , who can do mirac@@ les .
But how will they get children ?
The only solution that comes to mind is hum@@ our gender , which would kill the whole range .
It was already a series of children .
Children were on the ho@@ ok .
A@@ h , because it is a series of children ?
The UK@@ IP works for the My@@ ster@@ ons .
So please keep your Te@@ am America .
D@@ on ’ t in S@@ per@@ al@@ on@@ ation ?
It will not be the same if you do not see the s@@ ons and the anim@@ ation is well done .
I look forward to seeing this ( though being an adult ) , but I hope that this will give the idea of a chain to re@@ broadcast the old .
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia ; it has been at least 40 years since we had an hour and a Sunday at 0@@ 6 on Saturday and Sunday .
Since the arrival of digital television a few years ago , it has been on one of the second-@@ class commercial channels and we can always see it at these times .
And in addition to the half an hour &apos;s episo@@ des , from Monday to Friday , from Monday to Friday !
F@@ ine , I am probably a &apos; sad &apos; me@@ c of 60 years , but I am not looking at this series every day !
There is no &apos; M@@ oun@@ t of the temp@@ le &apos; in or under the mo@@ s@@ que of he@@ a@@ ven !
The radical Z@@ ion@@ ists invented this in order to give themselves political legitimacy to colon@@ ise Jerusalem .
Moreover , all Israeli sear@@ ches below and around the mo@@ squ@@ e mo@@ s@@ que for decades have not helped .
If he is somewhere else , he is somewhere else .
Can it be Argen@@ tine ?
This M@@ oun@@ t is not being sought for the simple reason that it is the h@@ ill on which the mo@@ squ@@ es were built .
Its summit , or the Ro@@ cher ’ s host , is b@@ lown up am@@ id@@ st the mo@@ s@@ que of Om@@ ar .
For Muslims , Mo@@ ham@@ med came to parad@@ ise from this ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it was M@@ ori@@ ah ’ s M@@ or@@ ah , where A@@ bra@@ ham failed to sacrifice his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
As long as it was taken and cont@@ ex@@ tual , there is no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also has its extremists , it is worth pointing this out regularly , and unfortunately they have been handed over to the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i Ben@@ net , A@@ vig@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Netanyahu , he had accepted the plan to two states and raised it continuously ! ) .
It is also good to show how much the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact .
Will God recognise his own ?
The smallest Jewish jo@@ ke : &apos; God is praised ! &apos;
To bo@@ ast about tourism in Israel , we are often told by na@@ ï@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ve young people , al@@ an@@ gu@@ ing on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usual , quite different from what advertising shows , as can be seen from the photo@@ grap@@ h that illustrates the article .
It is a little afraid , however .
And this photo@@ grap@@ h is a wonderful piece of propaganda !
It is a shame that the photo@@ grap@@ her of R@@ u@@ ters has not photo@@ graph@@ ed the hundreds of Palestinians who have been allowed to r@@ ally back to the temp@@ le of the temp@@ le and who prefer to b@@ ail the Jewish faithful to the wall , pra@@ ying to the Wall .
@ M@@ at , if this photo@@ grap@@ h distur@@ bs you , it is not the newspaper , nor the photo@@ grap@@ h , but this woman and the ideology she sends out that we must condemn .
This system is untenable and will end up in la@@ yers .
The only way to stop this system is revolution .
E@@ ver since the economy appears to be s@@ inging , large companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They have managed to convince their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages , while at the same time they have given even greater pay to the small elite at the top .
You are right , that is not tenable , but it will only change in that country when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of sho@@ oting and ge@@ aring when someone else strikes , support them , show a little solidarity and understand that their strike does not only affect their problems , but also shows your employer that people do not get away with them with impunity .
Unless democracy is abandoned , in which case it is tenable .
I totally agree with that .
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
For example , China and India .
That cannot be the end of the matter .
It was because we were in a democracy that it was .
Did you vote for the T@@ T@@ IP ?
The aims of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ IP ) are to increase the profits of companies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but it is exactly what the mechanism for settling disputes between investors and states ( S@@ S@@ D@@ s ) is being used for by the agreement .
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the un@@ imagin@@ able damage that this agreement will have on our lives .
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about it in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ an World Development Re@@ ports , so you will understand what is being negotiated in your back .
Did Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill say &apos; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &apos; ?
This has an excellent effect , while digital money has no reason to fall , let alone grow on trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
The gentle@@ man right , in X@@ V@@ III there were trade unions in all the areas .
In the highly Catholic French army , there is a sacrifice that is sacrificed .
Let us leave it ( its officers , the others , no one knows nothing ) believe themselves to be the co@@ ff@@ ers of France &apos;s e@@ ternal values , and it will fight and close .
And then with the decline in the country , globalisation , Europe , the crisis of values , in short : the dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this small re@@ lic is comfor@@ ting .
Even if it is increasingly un@@ comfortable ...
They are still missing the indicators of married men , c@@ ali@@ ves , married women , c@@ ali@@ ves and dogs lost , and I do not know what to do yet .
If you do not write the French correctly , I trade with myself .
You have been warned , it will be your fault .
In order to protect vested interests , the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough , which has led to a breakdown of equality with other citizens .
We are asked not to lau@@ gh about the risk of risk by an official .
One can well imagine a system of freedom of expression without trade unions , or without the right to strike as in Germany , in return for the protection they enjoy .
Otherwise , there is a guaranteed disaster .
And with the char@@ ts that are preparing for it , the government welcomes it .
What security are you talking about ?
Indeed , I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance in fact ...
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance for ignorance Sy@@ stems I referred to the military and other officials , since that is the subject here .
Sup@@ pose &apos; through its delegates &apos; in Article 8 of the preamble to the 19@@ 46 Constitution .
It will be : &apos; 8 .
Every worker contributes to the collective determination of working conditions and to business management &apos; .
This is absolutely essential with the intru@@ sion of informa@@ tive power .
And yet you have opened , presumably read and commented on a specific article entitled &apos; The Great B@@ e B@@ e O@@ ff review &apos; ?
wait , the section was there , there was a vacuum .
I thought we had to launch the convers@@ ation .
In any case , I have looked at the marriage of J@@ off@@ rey , which I have looked at , and I can tell you that some have been well thought out .
In the J@@ off@@ rey marriage , one of the best ( albeit misleading ) moments was television in the history of television .
So , from the pi@@ e m@@ m@@ m@@ o ...
Lad@@ y of Th@@ ron@@ es !
I love G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
This is the second time in a row that , stran@@ gely enough , the issue will end with a victory for the least worst b@@ ak@@ er ; no one has taken the kind of &apos; boom , are my ca@@ ke now and b@@ ent before your master &apos; !
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them ?
Over the past few weeks , all these external persons were kept out .
And there is also the idea of “ playing safety , ” next week , which dis@@ appears in the last week .
I like co@@ o@@ king , but I do not imagine that I am doing that .
I am grateful to those who do so and so offer us sup@@ er enter@@ tainment and try to find new things .
G@@ o for G@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree , the last challenge last year , that the marriage pi@@ e was absurd .
Prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als usually take days to do them and they had to co@@ b@@ ble together one in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three challenges were really hard to share , and I do not know how they were able to choose a winner .
In Lu@@ is , the only real short@@ coming they were able to find was the slightly dry basis ( although I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that Richard Richard ’ s green ice gl@@ ory did not en@@ vy , in any case , Richard Richard had already lost at that time ) .
I have to say that several challenges in this series seem to be somewhat artificial because of the time allocated .
There is also the cancer that is being cu@@ red , with solar b@@ lows .
There is no doubt that all of us are succe@@ eding at the moment .
This is a bad time for humanity , one hopes .
You confuse solar and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radiation .
U@@ V is blocked mainly by the ozone layer , which is shaped precisely by the impact of solar power par@@ ticles and U@@ V par@@ ticles .
So even if the mag@@ netic field weakened , there would be little solar wind to “ hun@@ t ” the str@@ at@@ o@@ sphere ’ s ozone .
There are even more , and hence less U@@ V and ‘ cancer ’ .
Fortunately , the ozone layer is not blocking the U@@ V .
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect .
If we confine ourselves to human beings , they have the interest of enabling us to have b@@ ones ( syn@@ thesis of vitam@@ in D ) , to heat us ( less than the in@@ ver@@ sely ) , to mod@@ ul@@ ate our immune system and , apparently , to improve our mor@@ ale .
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic U@@ V@@ s and leaves the U@@ V@@ A and most of the U@@ V@@ s .
You know that you are not obliged to be con@@ des@@ cen@@ ded and to regard your interlocu@@ tor as a stay when you make a comment ?
Especially for a minor prec@@ ision which was implied in the comment , which he himself intends to ped@@ dle .
Without saying that I am a mix@@ ture of mel@@ anom@@ a , the U@@ V@@ s only have AC@@ C@@ ER its development .
They are not the PR@@ O@@ V@@ O .
The evidence for this is that not all people have necessarily been b@@ len@@ ded .
Well , when a but@@ bi@@ b tells you that we need to avoid sun and to live at the bottom of a cell@@ ar , it is better not to listen , because U@@ V is necessary for every human being .
Ex@@ c@@ eption , on the other hand , is like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
U@@ V directly causes mel@@ anom@@ a .
Is it possible to give it to it ?
And , more importantly , can we switch it to the mixed ?
or to switch it to the mi@@ gh@@ ty ...
I believe that the majority of those interested have established that everything can be pl@@ a@@ ked if there is sufficient force and the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended for .
I believe that the army would need something more resili@@ ent and so has not yet adopted the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e@@ 6 as the fron@@ t-@@ line communication material .
For us , however ,
That remains a good choice .
The majority of those involved have established that everything can be pl@@ a@@ ked if there is sufficient force to do so .
Ex@@ cep@@ t for a No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
In particular , has he already complied ?
This jo@@ ke is being made in every discussion .
I have decided to count them .
It is the fourth jo@@ ke on the pl@@ a@@ ice that I read in the comments today .
It is difficult to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before we inst@@ all specific software , you can imagine that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain , and it is hard to see how it could come back to that .
So , the h@@ um@@ m@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ o
The most likely is that this is a production unit on which the i@@ O@@ S has not been inst@@ alled properly and is therefore stuck with the factory code of test established .
I do not know at all how they are doing this .
Is it , however , that they would put all test software on all ?
The photo@@ graph@@ s on E@@ bas@@ y clearly show the absence of a F@@ C@@ D or EC lo@@ go and the presence of a red lin@@ er of proto@@ type .
There is the article for b@@ ob@@ o par excellence .
We want to see products that are un@@ expensive , and we are surprised that industri@@ alists produce in &apos; industrial industries &apos; , but all the teachers and the small trade are involved in how to b@@ reath € 16@@ 50 ( $ 16@@ 50 ) ( average salary on the fr@@ ing@@ es ) ?
But to respond to your post , if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary .
After all , he is free to put his priorities where he sees fit .
For my part , food is one .
G@@ o without a gr@@ ud@@ ge , I will take you up with you .
B@@ ob@@ s , or better b@@ ob@@ lo@@ lo@@ s , are people who see the world through ideological “ software ” that leads them to dis@@ connect from reality .
It is total thin@@ k-@@ t@@ un@@ ge .
They are p@@ und@@ its , for example claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a show@@ er .
They are also experts in a back@@ lo@@ g , along with the lef@@ t-@@ over lef@@ t-@@ w@@ ash@@ ers , for example , by condemning CO2 emissions while they go on holiday to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not bear the br@@ unt of an ideology that is cumbersome and tar@@ n@@ ished , too , when it comes to frequent criticism of them .
W@@ a@@ h , thank you for this complete and comprehensive the@@ or@@ isation and for all the associated details ( aeroplan@@ es , show@@ er … ) .
I should like to be part of it , but I do not find myself .
The concept is not so complicated .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ lo@@ s are mon@@ g@@ ering .
Have you understood the concept of lef@@ t-@@ over ?
And you are in a position to understand the concept of the b@@ ob@@ o@@ ec@@ o .
It is perfect cop@@ ying with just an ideological nu@@ ance .
C@@ l@@ assi@@ fication would be more complicated if we took an interest in the eco@@ lo@@ s in the short term .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ eco@@ l@@ o is part of that , but it is only the most visible part of the eco@@ lo@@ s because it is the one that is inf@@ l@@ ating the media .
This is a beautiful game .
Ap@@ parently no one wants to face this game .
It is so bad that it is v@@ agu@@ ely like a woman .
You are next to the pl@@ ates .
We must be part of the micro@@ co@@ s@@ m of art to understand the stun@@ ning beau@@ ty of the truth of this work .
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment , since you have not spent countless decades studying and flat@@ tering large artists .
The important thing is not that E@@ mile is not able to draw up and appear to be obs@@ essed with the same subject .
What is important is that it has really succeeded in becoming truly rich and famous with no artistic capacity .
That is the art of the art of the art .
No , it is a co@@ ch@@ on .
The In@@ clu@@ sion of E@@ mile
That is not really a fact .
It is rather an opinion .
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs that smoke by playing the b@@ ill@@ ard .
Jud@@ ging art may be problematic , but not in that case .
It is much more than simply representing the real .
If you look for this , a pho@@ to machine will do the business .
The author also talks about E@@ mi@@ in &apos;s ex@@ pr@@ es@@ ism .
Look again and let the image speak for itself , without compar@@ ing it to the kind of design you might prefer .
If it is so easy , why do you not do it yourself ?
There is still savings to be made : equi@@ valence activities , the number of hor@@ ses of Republican Gu@@ ard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service ..@@ .@@ .
( FR ) ( honesty compe@@ ls France to reduce its workforce , but as all countries have done , sometimes even more drastically , starting with Great Britain .
It is only half encouraging ...
The operational system without the support , it quickly finds its limits !
This is a sing@@ ular approach , at a time when we are observing the weaknesses , the shortcomings of our defence tool , particularly in the Sa@@ hel .
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned , who lose a dimension of their activities , or even part of their history .
Where is the sanc@@ ti@@ mon@@ ious sanc@@ tu@@ ary ?
@ j@@ mon@@ d : that is what I was saying , and look at where to make savings but , above all , not to me , in my home , it really is not possible ...
That is exactly what you propose to do , look elsewhere where waste is certain .
The fact that all those who have had little or nothing to do with military action dare to say here , the eyes in the eyes that there is no money squ@@ an@@ dered in this per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without any la@@ ugh@@ ing over ...
Whether the same thing applies to the whole of the civil service and public finances will be a little better .
And , for Jo@@ i : look at public employment inflation in other ministries , and you will understand why defense can be thought to be a little p@@ acked !
Yes , yes , the economies on which everyone agrees that they need to be done , must it be somewhere , not ?
L@@ ack of a po@@ t , those on whom it is killed , when it happens to the poor , the poor .
It would be a crime , but above all it would not fall to me because , in this case , it is a crime and not an economy .
Gu@@ des@@ k , goes !
In what way will the V@@ al de Gra@@ ce shut down our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As far as local authorities are concerned , history is repeated with every closure of post , maternity , hospital and bar@@ r@@ acks .
But everyone is , of course , for the economies .
It is bizarre , a U@@ M@@ P may@@ or who wants compensation and does not look forward to savings made in public spending .
This article really is the most st@@ agg@@ ering rig@@ mar@@ o@@ le I have ever read !
This aw@@ k@@ ward moment in which the first three people are making the same bad jo@@ ke .
It was the dem@@ ise to challenge its Fac@@ e@@ book thre@@ ad and to see that 80 % of its friends began their stat@@ utes with the phrase “ this aw@@ k@@ ward moment . ”
I believe they will make a film .
He will surely be bas@@ ing himself on hil@@ ly scenes where someone falls by chance on his former bus on the bus by going to work and only to see where his sk@@ ir@@ t has returned to his tr@@ ous@@ ers .
It is not embarrassing , it is completely c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine .
Not really , in my opinion , adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bur@@ y his emotions and to sha@@ ke his te@@ eth .
I am sure that if you are a K@@ ate Bush f@@ an , the announcement of his return on the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong .
You will be aware that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights ?
I do not have the Internet .
So I do not think I can comment .
Not having a computer .
My go@@ d , I need that film before you die !
I am not sure how much this article is the most incredible rig@@ mar@@ o@@ le that I have ever read !
Char@@ lie has just shown that he is at the top of the co@@ sm@@ ic world of sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I would like to turn my attention to this .
It is absolutely essential that I agree with all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter that they should finally be ill@@ um@@ inated and discover the incredible me@@ g@@ ur@@ ance and insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us that l@@ ur@@ ks Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s ke@@ y@@ board as a div@@ ine g@@ lim@@ mer .
Good luck , it really was n@@ ull and void .
Especially if it is not women or the tra@@ w@@ lers .
I am a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive development within democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective voluntary initiatives .
So far , we have confisc@@ ated the right to save our planet by states that are playing the bu@@ ck at every meeting in order to save the planet .
We therefore decide , citizens , to take matters in hand .
All these fine recommendations have been stolen from the Commissioner , whom they have pl@@ anted with their energy .
T@@ rac@@ is@@ z : E@@ olig@@ ans and farms are tomorrow &apos;s R@@ on@@ ds .
All this is financed by the con@@ ge@@ sted con@@ -@@ tri@@ ble .
Please stop this pro-@@ nuclear dis@@ course .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not restricted to CO2 .
Rad@@ i@@ o@@ activity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not fully controlled , it is better to limit it to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energies are our only sal@@ vation , provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able electricity to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is not in any way affected .
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions from CO2 to production and ep@@ si@@ o for other steps .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity from wind or P@@ V is already more than G@@ V on the other stages and , above all , gas , or worse coal , as in Germany , to compensate for the inter@@ mit@@ tance .
Re@@ placing nuclear power by means of wind or P@@ V renewable renewable energy would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Christian I am not insul@@ ting you , as a State Do@@ c@@ tor in P@@ hy@@ si@@ cal Sci@@ ences 198@@ 1 , I made nuclear research into nuclear physi@@ cs . I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said .
As far as I did not say it was you who gave me some ideas I did not say anything about Germany , in fact you did not respond to what I said and as all the right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ish the interlocu@@ tor I never do .
I also quote from the experts man@@ dated by the German Government : Germany ’ s current programme for renewable energy sources is a non-@@ profitable and inefficient way to reduce greenh@@ ouse@@ -@@ gas emissions and should be stopped .
0 if you do not rely on the extraction of uranium and construction , and if you do not count the least greenhouse gas o@@ sten@@ effect as it is , and if you are not counting on two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant , you are talking about two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant , and a little in the water . rivers .
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a ‘ giant in South Asia ’ .
Last time , Pakistan won .
It does not surprise me , most of the Indi@@ ans who make comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan .
In fact , it shows your state of mind .
That would have been the same if they had described the India as the giant of South Asia ...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved , but having an Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply open up a P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box full of corruption and ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i .
As for the I@@ SL , today &apos;s opening match has been surprisingly interesting , the Ath@@ le@@ tic@@ o of K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata is 3-@@ 0 against M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
Com@@ pared to the billions and billions that India spends on I@@ PL and now football , how could we ever compete with our &apos; no@@ is@@ y neighbours &apos; ...
The race for co@@ smo@@ s is running out .
It is a shame for such a fine project .
As far as the incident is concerned , there is a failure of a possible design if a cold hel@@ m is too cold .
So perhaps there is not a lack of design , but implementation ...
Unlike a private company , it appears that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as the state is its own insu@@ rer .
They will be able to pay the satell@@ ites into fri@@ g@@ ates who know .
This is all the more unfortunate because many media are covered solely by the articles - and many read@@ ers are only holding these securities .
All this creates a false impression which is contrary to the content of the article itself .
All in agreement with you , the title is not appropriate , it un@@ ju@@ stly calls into question the project when it is only a problem of an open mind .
