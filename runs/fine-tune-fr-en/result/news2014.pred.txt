Sur@@ ve@@ y sa@@ ves in &quot; w@@ ing@@ follows &quot; above Bo@@ go@@ ta
The sport@@ s@@ woman J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ la@@ ez was a Thursday of a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter above Bo@@ go@@ ta , the Colombian capital .
E@@ qui@@ m@@ ated of a Tw@@ ing@@ follows ( a combination of air@@ -@@ like ) , it went to 160 km / h above the famous sanc@@ tu@@ ary Mon@@ tre@@ ra@@ te , located at more than 3 000 me@@ ters of al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ ra@@ ds had gathered to observe his explo@@ it .
A black box in your car ?
While the pl@@ ann@@ ers on the road network of the United States have trouble finding the money necessary to repair the motor@@ way motor@@ way infrastructure , many people are looking for a solution in the shape of a small black box that sets itself above the board of your car .
The devices , which record all the mi@@ xes made by a car driver and pass on information to the civil servants , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government offices of planning to re@@ work the obsolete system of financing the main American roads .
The sector usually without interest in the planning of major a@@ xes has suddenly triggered a lively debate and heated alliances .
The liber@@ tari@@ ans joined green groups to press for the government to use small bo@@ xes to keep track of the mi@@ xes you &apos;@@ re talking about , and possibly of the road you circul@@ ate , then use the information to write a tax bill .
The Te@@ a Par@@ ty is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liber@@ ties Union is also very concerned and express its concern about the protection of privacy .
And while members of Congress can &apos;t agree to know if you have to continue , several states di@@ dn &apos;t wait .
They &apos;@@ re looking for how , during the next decade , they will be able to go to a system allowing drivers to pay depending on the number of miles travelled .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of drivers have already taken these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with a monitoring system by G@@ PS , for an experimental video .
This is really necessary for our nation .
&quot; It &apos;s not as if we had the choice &quot; , said H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ ra@@ ta , director of the Sou@@ ther@@ n California Association .
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The pressure comes from the fact that the High@@ way Tr@@ ust Tr@@ ust from the country , financed with the taxes that the Americans pay at the p@@ ump , is financially dry .
Americans don &apos;t buy as much petrol as before .
The cars can take more mi@@ xes with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are reluctant to increase tax , even 1 hundred , while the prices of g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine are high .
&quot; The g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not sustainable &quot; , said Le@@ e M@@ un@@ n@@ ich , a specialist of transport policies at the University of Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
His state recently made trac@@ es on 500 cars to test a system of payment to mine .
&quot; This proves to be the most logical alternative in the long term &quot; , he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call that the use fees per kilome@@ tre .
It &apos;s not surprising that the idea is se@@ duc@@ ed by the liberals .
California pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system because they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set in the ambitious laws of the state on global warming .
But the representative Bill Sh@@ us@@ ter ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a ) , Chairman of the Committee of Transport of the House of Representatives , said he also saw him as the most viable alternative in the long term .
The free-@@ market supporters of the Re@@ ad@@ y foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for it .
&quot; It &apos;s not just a tax getting bo@@ gged down in a big black hole , &quot; said A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , deputy president of the politics Re@@ ad@@ son .
People pay more directly for the benefits they are given .
The movement is also supported by two former American secre@@ tar@@ ies in the Trans@@ ports who , in a 2011 report , called on the Congress to go down the path of payment to mine .
The American Senate approved a pilot project of 90 M $ last year that would have been about 10 000 cars .
But the presidency of the House killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many mi@@ xes every day to go to their work or the city .
Several states and big cities nonetheless make progress on their side .
The most determined is O@@ reg@@ on , which mobili@@ zed 5 000 drivers to lead the country &apos;s most important experience .
These drivers will soon pay the State for mil@@ e@@ age expenses instead of taxes on g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City is considering one .
Il@@ lin@@ is is trying to test a limited number of tr@@ uc@@ ks .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the American coast ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) studies how it could implement the change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where about 50 voluntary drivers have recently equipped their car with a de@@ vice , drivers were worried that the government could follow their che@@ apest facts and actions .
&quot; concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and this kind of thing are a big problem , &quot; said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din K@@ han , who runs the strategic management of performance at the N@@ ev@@ ada Trans@@ ports department .
It &apos;s not something that people want .
From the beginning of the trial , the N@@ ev@@ ada AC@@ L@@ N war@@ ns about its website : &quot; It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into a full location equipment . &quot;
It is not necessary to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be wi@@ el@@ ded to keep the recording of the all@@ és and daily coming of people .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is among the few states that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many mi@@ xes run a car , but without knowing the place or the exact time .
If we can do that , added K@@ han , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The search of this technology has brought some state agencies to call for a small star@@ t-@@ up of California &apos;s name .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society was not destined to help drivers who pay taxes to the states .
She was trying to pene@@ tr@@ ate the emerging market from au@@ to insurance , in which drivers would pay according to their mil@@ e@@ age .
But the devices they test have liked the pl@@ ann@@ ers of the main a@@ xes because they don &apos;t use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , perio@@ dic@@ ally down@@ loaded by mo@@ de@@ m .
&quot; The people will be more likely to do that if you don &apos;t record their speed and do not loc@@ ate them &quot; , said R@@ yan Mor@@ ris@@ on , director of the F@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
Great mistakes have been made in the pilot programs of some states .
There are much cheaper means and much less intru@@ sive methods to do .
In the O@@ reg@@ on , the pl@@ ann@@ ers try the experiment by offering the drivers different choices .
They can choose a de@@ vice with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have de@@ vice at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay a package based on the average number of mi@@ xes made by all the residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to people who are wary by allowing the aircraft to do more , rather than not enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials are trying to develop a tax de@@ vice that would also be equipped to pay for par@@ king fees , provide a &quot; payment for driving &quot; and create a set of data on the real speed from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic j@@ ams .
&quot; The drivers would be inc@@ ited to participate because of the benefits the system offers them &quot; , indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some of the transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder if the whole debate on the payment of mine is not just a huge di@@ version .
At the Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an Trans@@ ports Commission Commission of the San Franc@@ is@@ co Bay area , the officials say that Congress could very simply manage the High@@ way Tr@@ ust F@@ un@@ d &apos;s failure by increasing taxes on g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine .
A supplementary or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of petrol , so everyone pays their fair share .
&quot; It &apos;s not necessary to resort to radical sur@@ ger@@ y when we simply need aspir@@ in , &quot; said , &quot; R@@ é@@ y R@@ en@@ sh@@ ler , the director of legislation and public affairs in the committee . &quot;
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bo@@ y : four news
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an has not ended up sur@@ taking this year .
From The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , appeared in January , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a luxury re@@ edi@@ tion planned for 4 November , with several news news .
Four have already emerged on the To@@ le .
The announcement of the appearance of a new al@@ bu@@ m by David Bo@@ o@@ ie left everyone pan@@ els .
The day of its 6@@ 6@@ th anniversary , on 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ bu@@ m would come out in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last dis@@ k , Re@@ al@@ it@@ ty , the date of 2003 ) and too rare public appearances , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an showed that we could still count on him to s@@ ni@@ p the po@@ p .
A f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans
Not tired of sur@@ prises , David Bo@@ y had more of a tour in his ba@@ g with The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay .
The Th@@ in White Du@@ ke thus planned to re@@ publish this al@@ bu@@ m on 4 November .
For the occasion , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a real f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans .
This re@@ edi@@ tion , entitled The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a , will be presented in the form of three dis@@ cs : the original al@@ bu@@ m , novel stu@@ di@@ o sessions and bul@@ le@@ ks , as well as a D@@ V@@ D containing the four c@@ ops already un@@ ve@@ iled .
The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a will contain a total of ten additional ti@@ t@@ les compared to the original al@@ bu@@ m : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x@@ e edi@@ tion , five s@@ ong@@ s specially un@@ ve@@ iled for the occasion , as well as two red@@ i@@ x@@ es .
David Bo@@ y also made the presen@@ tations of this beautiful co@@ ff@@ y in a video .
It introduces at the same time every dis@@ k , but also the acc@@ ess@@ ories provided with it : exclusive photo@@ s and po@@ les , a car@@ net to share his own im@@ pres@@ sions , a le@@ af@@ let with the words ...
And , above all , he gives a fore@@ taste of his new title At@@ om@@ ica , typically in the ve@@ in of The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , with a very good gu@@ y and a ro@@ ck electricity well controlled .
Some news
But At@@ om@@ ica is not the only title to un@@ ve@@ il his weapons .
The In@@ forming , Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ck@@ let M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O are also available on the web .
The In@@ formed is in double front : a wor@@ ris@@ ome inter@@ tra@@ o before a lu@@ b@@ bing ca@@ val@@ c@@ ade that slowly slow@@ ed up to leave a p@@ p bal@@ lo@@ ade .
On Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ck@@ let M@@ an , did Bo@@ ys want to make a small reference to the Ro@@ k@@ let M@@ an of El@@ ton John , or even to Gr@@ avi@@ ty ?
With this kidn@@ apped title , the sing@@ er seems in any case in his element when he no longer has foot on earth .
S@@ pace O@@ d@@ d@@ it@@ ty , next door , was much more serious .
On Bor@@ n I A U@@ F@@ O , David Bo@@ y once again reference to his str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold : would he come from another planet ?
The ri@@ ff@@ ers &apos; ri@@ ff@@ ers , fun@@ ny , give want to leave the Earth .
Bo@@ ys am@@ used themselves to play the cam@@ é@@ le@@ on with these ti@@ t@@ les : tour tow@@ er , man on board a roc@@ ket , Mar@@ ine potential ...
It conce@@ als and reveals at the same time , plays different person@@ alities , as he did throughout his career , especially with his charac@@ ters Z@@ ig@@ gy St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ add S@@ ane .
It &apos;s not surprising that he has a hand@@ master in hand in the photo@@ graphy of the countryside . The In@@ v@@ estig@@ ation in the V@@ y@@ age , the brand Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , whose new face he represents .
It will appear in one of their advertising spo@@ ts , published from 10 November .
Minister of Defense , Ro@@ b Nic@@ ol@@ son , insisted that the w@@ ounded soldiers w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be sum@@ mon@@ ed out of Canadian armed forces , and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before returning to civil life .
At@@ t@@ ressed by liberals and neo-@@ democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr Nichol@@ son assured that before their release , the army members followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
All w@@ ounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and none of them is released before being ready , he said .
Cri@@ tics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing w@@ ounded soldiers - who do not respond to the rule of &quot; the army &apos;s univers@@ ality &quot; demanding that the staff be able to carry out a series of varied tasks - to reach the 10 year ad@@ mis@@ sibility period required for pension benefits .
In particular , they cited two cases reported by La Pres@@ se Canadian , including that of a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Corpor@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a reser@@ vis@@ t of London , in On@@ tari@@ o , reached the post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , was released from the army despite his request to stay one year more so that he can receive a fully inde@@ xed retirement .
His case came after the one from the Corpor@@ al Ger@@ en Kir@@ k@@ en , who said in front of a parliamentary commission , last month , that he was pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the rule of univers@@ ality of the service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared to leave , with plans and consultation sessions , but that it was completely different than the fact of wanting to leave the ranks .
&quot; I told them that I was not ready &quot; , he said during an interview with La Pres@@ se Canadian Wednesday .
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay , and they said no .
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army is struggling to determine which la@@ titude it can give the w@@ ounded soldiers who want to stay inside , but who are not fit in the fight .
Under current rules , injured soldiers have been injured until three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deploy abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons , 19@@ 9 di@@ dn &apos;t reach the service period required to get retirement benefits .
The liberal spokes@@ person for former combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked for Wednesday the reintegration of Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , while the neo-@@ democr@@ at J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for the immediate end of &quot; this shameful practice . &quot;
Dis@@ ney on the shel@@ ves to launch a anim@@ ated series
The American media and enter@@ tainment group decided to give preference to the t@@ ab@@ lets on its own TV channels for the next round of a new series of children .
The first nine episo@@ des of She@@ i@@ ff C@@ alli@@ s Wil@@ d W@@ est will be available from 24 November on the website Wor@@ ch@@ Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ j@@ uni@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m or via its application for phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
His global launch on the Dis@@ ney group channels is planned only in 2014 , details the release of his division Dis@@ ney J@@ uni@@ or .
The anim@@ ated design , aimed at the children of 2 to 7 years old , tell the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the Ch@@ at@@ te C@@ alli@@ e , sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of a city in the American west where she is putting order in order with a mag@@ ical l@@ as@@ o .
Each episo@@ de includes two stories of 11 minutes .
&quot; Inter@@ action with smar@@ t@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &quot; , commented Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , Vice-President responsible for digital products at Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , cited in the communication .
This kind of experience comes within the framework of Dis@@ ney &apos;s efforts to &quot; expand the life span of its series and build new relations with its public thanks to digital platforms that are becoming more and more important &quot; , he added .
A survey published at the beginning of the week by comm@@ on Den@@ se Me@@ di@@ a showed an explo@@ sion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of the less than 2 years have already served a t@@ ab@@ let or phone , and 72 % of the less than 8 years , compared to 10 % and 38 % .
S@@ now@@ den is ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with Germany on the question of American supervision
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the whis@@ tle@@ b@@ ast@@ er of the American intelligence services , said he was ready to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy to the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director K@@ e@@ ith Alexander di@@ dn &apos;t provide answers on their activities .
The German deputy , Hans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ ö@@ be@@ le met on Thursday Mr. S@@ now@@ den in Russia , where he benefits from the right to asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter that the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &quot; Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a le@@ ak and seeks to pen@@ alize political dis@@ course with accusations against which it &apos;s impossible to defend itself . &quot;
However , saying the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him .
In the context of the complaint lod@@ ged by the US Ministry of Justice , he is accused of sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of state property .
H@@ an@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich , minister of the German inter@@ ior , said to Z@@ eli@@ it On@@ line : &quot; If Mr. S@@ now@@ den is ready to talk to the German officials , we will make sure that we make that possible . &quot;
The relations between the United States and Germany have been severely tested following complaints according to which the N@@ SA had been listening to the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Thomas O@@ p@@ tu@@ r , the deputy who runs the parliamentary group over@@ looking the foreign secret services , said that if there was a chance to listen to Mr. S@@ now@@ den as a witness &quot; without putting it in danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States &quot; , we should enjoy it .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a German Green deputy , published a pho@@ to of him with Mr. S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
During his visit to Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that according to the lawyer of the former consul@@ tant of the N@@ SA , Mr. S@@ now@@ den could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den had testi@@ fied in Germany , he should be assured that he would be &quot; security &quot; there , said the deputy .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter he was the subject of a campaign of &quot; serious and sustained &quot; persecution that forced him to leave his country .
However , he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
Citizens from all over the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – judged that the re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was of public uti@@ lity .
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved &quot; .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able could soon offer inter@@ active TV
The subscri@@ bers of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able may have access to applications like Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter and the video service service on request Net@@ f@@ li@@ x via their television in a future that does not seem so far away .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o &apos;s subsidiary indicated on Thursday that she is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the be@@ ta version of this platform with some of her users .
&quot; This will allow us to highlight more us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces as well as more options &quot; , explained the president and head of the management of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , Lou@@ is Au@@ d@@ et , in interview .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able thus does not follow his competitors , like Bel@@ l , even if the Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary does not yet have a specific date regarding this new platform .
&quot; We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail &quot; , underlined Mr Au@@ d@@ et .
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our clients do not currently have access .
The telec@@ oms giant Ro@@ gers has already indicated that it could offer Net@@ f@@ li@@ x if certain technical details , which were not mentioned , could be settled .
In the United States , the popular video service says being in discussion with some major c@@ ables so that its service is available via their distribution platforms .
The p@@ .@@ pon@@ o de Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able also welcomed the announcement by the government Har@@ per during his T@@ ot@@ ine speech on 16 October last .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force TV and c@@ able TV providers to offer customers the possibility of paying services on the map .
&quot; It &apos;s been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channels of channels , it doesn &apos;t work &quot; , said Mr. Au@@ d@@ et .
He hopes , however , that the consultations conducted by the Canadian radio broadcasting and communications council ( CR@@ T@@ C ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&quot; It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television &quot; , said the P@@ M de Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o .
The CR@@ T@@ C has been holding consultations with the public since last week and they should continue with the industry next spring .
As for the results , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o indicated having recorded a net profit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 actions per action .
This is a retro@@ grade step compared to the net profit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million , or 83 for action , of the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this decline with depreci@@ ation costs linked to new acquisition .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o acquired the c@@ able c@@ able At@@ lan@@ c B@@ ad@@ b@@ and in 2012 , established in the United States , for 1.@@ 36 billion .
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal .
Last December , the show company also bought Pe@@ er 1 Network En@@ ter@@ prise , an Internet provider established in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , for the sum of 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o &apos;s income , they grew 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter to reach 50@@ 4.@@ 7 million .
They are 1.@@ 8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able , was 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 % per action , back compared to 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million , or 93 % action , of the same period last year .
However , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able &apos;s income has increased by 45 % to reach 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 customers during the fourth quarter .
However , for the 2013 financial year , the number of customers of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able is rising 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Au@@ d@@ and doesn &apos;t worry about seeing the number of customers changing in this way .
For me , it &apos;s not an indication of a change of trend , he observed .
It varies from one quarter to the next with very strong competition .
From the horse in beef products
From horse meat to be found in the can@@ ning bo@@ xes of beef products , sold by two small British prof@@ essors of cheap distribution , today announced the food hygiene agency .
routine tests have revealed that the products , drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the channels .
&quot; As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , she should not have been present in the product &quot; explained the British agency .
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in co@@ o@@ ked food in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests carried out in Ireland .
According to tests from the European Commission , France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles did four w@@ ounded , early on Friday , on road 1@@ 31 , in Lan@@ audi@@ ère .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ h , a motor@@ ist who was moving in the north , in Sain@@ t-@@ F@@ é@@ li@@ x@@ -@@ Val@@ o@@ is , lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occup@@ ants of both vehicles were injured , but we did not fear for their lives .
The movement came back to normal at 6@@ h , Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make your hand b@@ agg@@ age pay
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make the passengers who carry out hand@@ bag@@ s on his flights pay up to $ 100 .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to start making up to $ 100 for a hand b@@ agg@@ age and $ 2 for a coffee or a so@@ da , even though in its announcement Wednesday , it indicated that passengers could take the can@@ e un@@ open with them at the des@@ cent of the plane .
The new b@@ agg@@ age fees are related to the bag@@ s in the higher comp@@ ound , so the little bag@@ s inst@@ alled under the sie@@ ge will always be free .
Fron@@ tier said that she would pay $ 25 if the expenses were paid in advance and $ 100 if the travel@@ ers only paid once at the bo@@ arding door .
The spokesman of Fron@@ tier , K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley indicated that the $ 100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to make this price pay &quot; , she explained .
Air@@ lines started making the first and second b@@ agg@@ age pay in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who tried to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in hand@@ -@@ hand b@@ agg@@ age in higher compar@@ tments , so there was often no room in these compar@@ tments .
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers transport fewer things on board .
The French said that these new expenses will not really be used to collect money .
It &apos;s a question of making the clients of Fron@@ tier the most loyal that it becomes more and more difficult to find space in higher compar@@ tments .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who buy their ticket on the company &apos;s website will not have to pay .
So a passenger qu@@ eu@@ ing at a bo@@ arding door Fron@@ tier could transport a ba@@ g free , while the next person in the tail could have to pay $ 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
&quot; Mal@@ ley explained that the site and registration procedures of Fron@@ tier are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these expenses before coming to the door .
Fron@@ tier b@@ agg@@ age fees will not be applied before the summer , even though no date has been fixed .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often rou@@ gh about b@@ agg@@ age and other costs , but the airlines love them .
They think the handling costs of b@@ agg@@ age are important and that the passengers who want this service should pay for it .
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of b@@ agg@@ age fees as a sign that proves that airlines make a lot of money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
However , many of them did not go to b@@ agg@@ age fees .
S@@ pi@@ rit Air@@ lines In@@ c@@ . had applied the first b@@ agg@@ age fees in hand three years ago , and the low-cost company Al@@ gi@@ gi@@ ant followed a little later .
The only other company that imposes such expenses is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , said the consul@@ tant with airlines .
He estimated , in a report of December 2011 , that S@@ pi@@ rit &apos;s hand@@ bag@@ s cost $ 50 $ per year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former B@@ id@@ west Air@@ lines framework , recently travel@@ ed on S@@ pi@@ rit and asked what it was going to find at the bo@@ arding door at a time when the passengers would discover the unusual hand b@@ agg@@ age fees imposed by the company .
&quot; I had never seen a bo@@ arding procedure as flu@@ id throughout my professional career , &quot; he said .
I expected to see te@@ eth and a b@@ light bur@@ st at the door .
The plane was full , he added , &quot; the passengers went on board at the speed of clarity &quot; .
Fron@@ tier also does like S@@ pi@@ rit and applies costs of $ 2 for a coffee , a te@@ a , a so@@ da or a fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier has indicated that passengers who take a so@@ da or fruit ju@@ ice can take the can@@ e un@@ open with them , and those who take coffee can be served free .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
US Air@@ ways briefly tried to make drinks pay for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and when no other big airline had followed .
The decision of Fron@@ tier to make hand@@ bag@@ s pay for hand@@ bag@@ s when passengers don &apos;t buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go on his website .
Air@@ lines pay for online tri@@ ps like Or@@ bi@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of going to an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier went further in this area .
In September , she started to offer only half m@@ ol@@ ds of loyalty to clients who bought their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , she reduced the minimum premiums of 25 % on a trip .
For example , a Fron@@ tier trip with 1 000 miles bought with an online trip agency would make it possible to win 250 minutes .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the site of Fron@@ tier .

The N@@ SA calls into question an &quot; internal error &quot; and no computer ha@@ c@@ kers
The National Security Agency working in the shad@@ ows said Friday that it was a bu@@ g that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , and not ha@@ c@@ kers as some had claimed online .
&quot; N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v remained in@@ accessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that took place during a planned update &quot; , indicated the es@@ pion@@ age agency in a declaration by em@@ ail .
The problem will be solved tonight .
The claims that the breakdown was due to a service denial denial attack &#91; D@@ S@@ D &#93; are false .
Ear@@ lier tonight , online ser@@ vers trac@@ ing have noted that the N@@ SA site had been broken for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokesman indicated to A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the agency &apos;s sensitive internal network was &quot; not at all &quot; compromise .
No classified information is in danger , explained the spokes@@ person .
At least a group of online ha@@ k@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts asser@@ ted being responsible for the N@@ SA website with a D@@ S@@ D attack .
The D@@ S@@ D attacks are aimed at in@@ und@@ ating a dedicated site until the ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
Cy@@ ber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not destined to enter the internal network of the targeted system .
The former N@@ SA once ul@@ tr@@ a secret , a time called &quot; N@@ o Su@@ ch A@@ gen@@ cy &quot; , has found itself under the spot@@ light and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its vast communications surveillance programs at national and abroad level - which are among the secret files of the N@@ SA stolen at the agency and dis@@ closed by the former dis@@ ab@@ using of the N@@ SA , Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
This growing controversy around the agency caused a lot of speculation that tonight &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
The Del@@ ta C@@ -@@ V@@ ille now closed
The hot@@ els Del@@ ta C@@ -@@ V@@ ille closed its doors on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that poss@@ essed the edi@@ fic@@ e sold it to promo@@ ters who will transform it into student homes .
Three hundred and fifty people were working in the ho@@ tel .
Of these , 200 have still not found new jobs .
Del@@ ta promises not to let his employees fall .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers came to meet employees directly on the spot , we met employees individually to evaluate their needs .
&quot; This be@@ t will continue for the next six months &quot; , explains the regional director of the working relationships of H@@ ô@@ tel Del@@ ta , F@@ eli@@ x B@@ is@@ son .
The closure of the Del@@ ta comes in a very competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that was the owner of this construction had choices to make .
Either he re@@ invested in building to continue to operate , so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very f@@ ero@@ ci@@ ous , there are lots of new hot@@ els that appeared in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&quot; Or either he sel@@ ls him to someone else , and that &apos;s what happened &quot; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ult , the holder of the tourism Ch@@ aire Trans@@ at to the A@@ K@@ A@@ M &apos;s management of the management sciences .
Other Mon@@ tre@@ al hot@@ els will also be converted in the next few months , like the C@@ rown P@@ la@@ za that will become a residence for the elderly .
Meanwhile , four ho@@ tel projects with almost 600 cham@@ bers will come into being in two years .
For the CE@@ O of Tit@@ an , &quot; Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar A@@ mi@@ ens &apos; purchase project begins with zero employee &quot;
After throwing the spon@@ ge with f@@ uc@@ ks in January for the partial recovery of the Go@@ od@@ year site of A@@ mi@@ en@@ -@@ North promised closure , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , the CE@@ O of the American T@@ H@@ E T@@ H@@ E , says , today , ready to save 3@@ 33 jobs on the 1 137 in the factory .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ burg , minister of productive recovery , had already announced it on Monday 21 October .
Having renoun@@ ced the factory &apos;s purchase project in January , you are coming back today .
You had pronounced violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about &quot; supposedly workers &quot; who &quot; work three hours &quot; a day , &quot; cra@@ zy unions &quot; , targeting the C@@ G@@ T .
We don &apos;t understand this U@@ -@@ turn .
Is it to please Mr. Mon@@ te@@ burg ?
I don &apos;t try to make anyone happy .
Ex@@ cep@@ t my wife .
Mr. Mon@@ te@@ burg , is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
If I hurt someone with my words , I &apos;@@ m sorry .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Does the truth hurt you ?
To work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours imp@@ airs France .
In India , in China and in many other countries , we work 10 to 12 hours per day .
But I have no prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is well located and has sp@@ aces to expand .
Why is Tit@@ an so much in need of this factory ?
Tit@@ an doesn &apos;t need to buy this factory .
But , with a correct price and competent workers , it &apos;s worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ o@@ dy@@ e@@ ar ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the factory , Go@@ od@@ year had offered employees a good start allowance , I think 100 % of employees would have accepted it .
Now , imagine that Tit@@ an is buying at Go@@ o@@ dy@@ e@@ ar the closed factory .
So , Tit@@ an could move machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency .
I think Mr. Mon@@ te@@ burg knows this .
However , he wants to keep the factory in A@@ mi@@ ens with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid jobs .
Tit@@ an agrees to recru@@ it them among the 1@@ ,@@ 200 current employees of Go@@ o@@ dy@@ e@@ ar .
Also , Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a commitment from Tit@@ an before trying to get the C@@ G@@ T to sit down at the table with Go@@ o@@ dy@@ e@@ ar .
The first step is for the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ o@@ dy@@ e@@ ar to agree on the departure expenses for all employees .
So there will be no employees in the factory .
Mr. Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you were ready to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm it ?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four@@ -year guarantee .
But , as I told you , the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar must first agree on the departure expenses .
If all employees accept them , the purchase project of the factory starts with zero employee .
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no longer employees on the site ?
If Mr. Mon@@ te@@ burg succe@@ eds in the fact that the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year agree and that Tit@@ an buy the factory , we intend to stay in A@@ mi@@ en@@ -@@ North more than four years .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s profit declining , while deli@@ veries and orders of aircraft are going back .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er In@@ c , Canadian aircraft manufacturer and rail manufacturer , sign@@ alled a 15 % fall in its net profits on Thursday , under pressure from a decrease in orders and deli@@ veries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Tro@@ h@@ ain@@ e division .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , also did not provide flying test data for his whole new C@@ Ser@@ ies plane nor information to know if the plane will respect its ambitious calendar of commercial service before September .
After the inaug@@ ural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago , it only stolen three times , and the question then asked whether the trial phase was on the right track .
The results di@@ dn &apos;t match the forecast and the stock prices fell by 8 % on the Tor@@ onto Sto@@ ck Sto@@ ck .
Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st in the National Bank Fin@@ al , low@@ ered his rating on Thursday , passing from &quot; performance performance &quot; to &quot; performance performance &quot; because of the low potential to increase the stock exchange during the next quarter or the next two quarters .
&quot; Although the decrease in deli@@ veries of aircraft has been largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Trans@@ sports division &quot; , said Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a note to the clients .
We think B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er will have new orders for his C@@ Ser@@ ies planes as the flight tests program progress .
However , if no new order is announced in the next few months , we expect the market to become more skep@@ tical about the program .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ d@@ it hopes that the family of C@@ Ser@@ ies will be able to cat@@ ap@@ ult in the lower seg@@ ment of a market today dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first trial plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and fled for the first time in September after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for C@@ Ser@@ ies planes is modest up to 17@@ 7 . It seems that potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to valid@@ ate the claims of society regarding energy efficiency and the potential savings potential of the new line of line .
At present , society has recorded a total of 40@@ 3 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ to , president and head of the management , is convinced that B@@ om@@ bar@@ d@@ it will reach his goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial service of the first plane .
The leaders also reassured the analy@@ sts and the media Thursday by telling them that the program was moving forward according to the calendar .
&quot; The trial plane ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t stay@@ ed in the ground longer than expected &quot; , said Mr. Be@@ au@@ must at a telephone conference , adding that the ground tests and the software up@@ dates were planned during the time when the plane was stopped .
Each manufacturer planned differently .
We decided to take a first flight and to plan a update period , and that &apos;s what we did .
This will happen throughout the flying program .
The second of the five test aircraft should be ste@@ w@@ ed up in the coming weeks , the others will follow shortly afterwards , has indicated society .
Yet analy@@ sts are skep@@ tical about the fact that the first customer can fly a C@@ Ser@@ ies plane only 12 months after his inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er said that she was assessing the entry timetable and providing new information in the next few months .
&quot; This slow@@ ness of flight tests - although it is apparently consistent with B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s internal calendar - reinforces our opinion that the entry into service will be pushed back in the first quarter of 2015 &quot; , said Mr. Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
In the third quarter , on 30 September , B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s net profit fell to 14@@ 7 M $ $ , or 8 c@@ ents per action , compared to $ 17@@ 2 M , or 9 c@@ ents per action , one year earlier .
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
The income fell slightly from 4.@@ 2 to $ 4.@@ 1 M@@ d .
The analy@@ sts expected a result of 10 c@@ ents per action and the income of $ 4.@@ 56 million , according to Thomas Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / E / S@@ .
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that it delivered 45 planes in the quarter , compared to 57 a year earlier .
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft , compared to 83 before .
The delay in the A@@ ér@@ on@@ au@@ tic division represented 3@@ 2.@@ 9 M@@ Y to 30 September , which is not changed compared to 31 December of the previous year .
&quot; In A@@ ér@@ on@@ au@@ tics , the results were in line with our predic@@ tions , but the low number of orders and the general conditions of the market were disappointing &quot; said Mr. Be@@ au@@ must .
A@@ ér@@ on@@ au@@ tics &apos;s income fell by 13 % to reach $ 2 .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ d@@ it , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , said that the income of this division had increased by almost 11 % at $ 2.@@ 1 million .
The order books of the Trans@@ -@@ sports division total $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ Y to 30 September , or a small increase compared to 31 December of the previous year .
The margins of the transport division have suffered from implementing problems concerning a few big contracts .
The leaders announced that new information would be provided during the fourth quarter .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s stock price , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ch@@ et@@ te , the head of the Google In@@ c &apos;s financial management , would sit on the management board , fell from 8@@ .5 % to $ 4.@@ 83 in Canadian in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazilian company Em@@ br@@ er SA , third aircraft manufacturer in the world and competi@@ tor closest to B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , indicated on Thursday a 10 % decrease in its quar@@ terly profit .
Two sp@@ ra@@ e@@ olog@@ ists of 23 and 27 years were missing in a cha@@ s@@ m under the De@@ ath of Cro@@ ls since Thursday night , was taught on Friday at the help of the Is@@ le .
They were loc@@ alized this Friday afternoon .
Both men , a agu@@ est one in practice and the other no , went under the land on Thursday at 9 : 30 to make a trip from the De@@ ath of Cro@@ es , located on the commun@@ al of Sain@@ t-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re-@@ de-@@ Char@@ tra@@ y .
We were then without any news from them since then , said the same source .
&quot; S@@ p@@ é@@ le@@ e@@ olog@@ ists should have come out at 5 hours in the morning &quot; , said Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry L@@ arri@@ be , technical advis@@ er to the S@@ p@@ é@@ le@@ o help in the emergency organization .
Do@@ z@@ ens of people on the spot
Ab@@ out 20 of the res@@ cu@@ es , 10 members of the French Re@@ li@@ gious Hel@@ p , as well as police , CR@@ S and fire@@ men were there .
At the end of afternoon this Friday , the two sp@@ ra@@ e@@ olog@@ ists were loc@@ alized .
&quot; It &apos;s another group of sp@@ el@@ e@@ olog@@ ists who , after having found them exhausted but in good health in the a@@ val@@ ity , gave information to one of the emergency teams engaged in the network &quot; explains Le D@@ au@@ ph@@ in .
The two soldiers at the 13@@ th bat@@ tal@@ ion of the Al@@ p@@ b@@ é@@ y al@@ pine Cha@@ s@@ ers were found &quot; exhausted , but not injured &quot; .
They lost themselves in the network , returned to their steps while waiting for the help , specified the pre@@ fec@@ ture .
Re@@ sul@@ t , they should come out in stra@@ w with the help of the rescue workers in the evening .
German journalists invited to flee Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o
The German journalists &apos; union invited its members to stop using Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o online services after new re@@ vel@@ ations about the activities of the American and British intelligence services .
&quot; The German Federation of Jour@@ n@@ alists recommends to journalists to avoid any order to use search engines and Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o messages , &quot; she says in a communication .
She considers &quot; scandalous &quot; the information from Washington Po@@ st , according to which the US National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) and the government government He@@ ad@@ quar@@ ters ( G@@ C@@ H@@ Q ) have collected m@@ asses of information by inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating international networks that allow both firms to syn@@ chron@@ ize their ser@@ vers .
&quot; research carried out by the journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &quot; , added Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ ken , the president of the union who claims 3@@ 8@@ ,000 members .
Ma@@ ke re@@ pain@@ ts : a deputy asks for the resignation of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te .
The project of the minister Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te grou@@ w@@ els to &quot; link &quot; po@@ les of traffic lights in Brussels doesn &apos;t like everyone .
As a reminder , the Brussels Minister of Lab@@ ors Public and Transport has launched this Thursday at the center of Brussels a test project of pain@@ ting 16 po@@ te@@ tes of traffic lights from the region to the y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ors of Brussels .
The goal is both &quot; to increase security &quot; and &quot; the Brussels identity &quot; .
The idea is , in the long run , to pain@@ t all the Brussels sign@@ alling lights , for an estimated cost of about a million euros .
But the blue chosen by the minister is &quot; too we@@ ir@@ d &quot; , according to the Brussels deputy Em@@ manu@@ el De Bo@@ ck@@ k who talks about &quot; Flem@@ ish &quot; of the capital and demands the &quot; resignation &quot; of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te .
&quot; Not happy to spend the money from Brussels to the col@@ or of sign@@ alling po@@ les at the col@@ ors of the Brussels region , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te .
After his tax@@ -@@ man@@ e-@@ man@@ e-@@ black tax@@ is , she finally portra@@ yed himself in the dark blue blue , the po@@ les of Brussels .
According to the deputy , there is now &quot; no more difference of vis@@ ually continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels &quot; .
Brussels laws deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a minister C@@ D &amp; V who itself realize the N@@ V@@ A programme .
It &apos;s high time to stop the Tro@@ j@@ an horse from F@@ landers .
&quot; For reminder , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els was elected only with 2 2@@ 45 votes , which is 0.5 % of Brussels laws ! &quot; , concludes Mr. De Bo@@ c@@ k .

The dismantling decision , announced by the Fin@@ ist@@ ère pre@@ fec@@ ture Wednesday , was taken by the company E@@ Com@@ ou@@ v , the por@@ k manag@@ er .

Five years ago , my father er@@ ased the world of living .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking about him now ,
I was so sc@@ ared of forgetting it or rather I di@@ dn &apos;t know how I was going to continue to &quot; attend &quot; .
There is no recipe , job mode to pass the wall of the in@@ visible and find its own .
Then there are signs .
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving .
Another time , a show@@ er in the middle night to watch his show that doesn &apos;t leave me any@@ more , put on the night table .
It &apos;s the image of my s@@ mil@@ ing father who ac@@ companies me in my actions everyday .
Our mother left after her exha@@ u@@ sting fight against cancer .
That &apos;s at least what I thought of the day when I found his empty body , cr@@ ashed on this hospital bed to the fr@@ ing@@ ed flags .
Similarly , his fun@@ erals were an ic@@ ic@@ al f@@ are@@ well focused around the sh@@ it@@ ty light of the ch@@ and@@ els that were fram@@ ing her co@@ ol .
I thought she was part .
L@@ it@@ tle by little , with small bal@@ lots or no@@ c@@ ists , a little sh@@ it@@ ty , a little deleted , she quickly came back to my mind , moving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that thought in m@@ our@@ ning .
And then , it turned out to be just as revealing my own fac@@ ets that I ha@@ ven &apos;t yet seen , m@@ asked by my relationship with her .
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother , but only a woman that I di@@ dn &apos;t really know , a woman who represented this person , during her stay in life .
In dying , this woman had perfect life and freed the person I like , and here I found her , full and full .
This journey of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful .
It &apos;s a privilege to know that loved people don &apos;t leave us .
I look like my father , &quot; inside as well as outside &quot; he said .
I was always told .
I never believed it at the time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , sick .
Here , I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him .
One day he &apos;s dead .
For a long time , he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was sc@@ ared , when I was badly ...
He told me , constantly encouraged me , he lived my body .
I saw his hands while watching mine , I lend her my body .
But it was never in@@ discre@@ et .
I could have a personal life .
It left me in@@ tim@@ ate .
It lasted a long time and one day he left .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I don &apos;t know who said that the dec@@ e@@ ased people are not forgotten but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer but I constantly feel close to myself .
Every event , every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it : what would they have said ? What would they have thought ? What would they have ?
I constantly dream of them , maybe not all ni@@ ghts but several times a week that &apos;s sure .
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it &apos;s too late , only there is one thing that prevents me from doing this moment .
I &apos;@@ m often sc@@ ared when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence .
Sometimes , some dreams concern me on the contrary and form part of my story and indeed , they continue to live and share my life .
The day before I was supposed to know the sex of my baby , I dre@@ am@@ ed that I wo@@ ke up , I was lying out of the bed , my father was waiting for me and he remembered and was delighted that I was waiting for a little bo@@ y .
The next day , I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sle@@ ep to tell me he was happy to share what happened to me .
And of course , it was a little bo@@ y in my ven@@ ue .
I liked to share this moment with him and I &apos;@@ m happy to talk about this common memory lived after his death .
Prec@@ isely five years ago , my grand@@ mother died as a result of cancer .
A year before , she was on trip with my family in Cuba .
It &apos;s to say the shock that his disappearance caused the young b@@ ast@@ er I was at the time .
However , I did my m@@ our@@ ning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , especially in times when I find myself in trouble , or when I have to take important decisions .
At@@ t@@ acking the Arab and interested in the Middle East , to the point of making a master of it in a large school , have not been , with hin@@ d@@ sight , harm@@ less choices .
In fact , I heard it often speak Arab@@ ic in my childhood , and talk about Morocco , where she had lived for decades - before going back to France at the time of independence .
The values she accused me are still present , so I can think how she would like me to act at some point .
The same goes for my attitudes : I &apos;@@ m trying to live up to the generosity and the spirit of spirit of the one that was a religious fer@@ vent .
From now on , I feel like a daily presence , a good soul , a living spirit .
I see his eyes on me .
My mother died 19 years ago now .
De@@ ath after having spoken to me on the phone .
I went through all the stages : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , pain , the be@@ aches that are triggered on their own , anywhere , in unusual places , anywhere in unusual places .
Then , the time has cal@@ med down .
It was only the lack , this empty empty without any response , that need for her , to give me , to reassure myself at the cry of her sof@@ tness .
Yet she is there , silent presence , she is there and watch me .
All the morning , I see her anxious eyes to ask himself on me , I see the circle that increases her eyes , the ri@@ f@@ les around the li@@ ps that the cigarettes are dig@@ ging , the b@@ ars that mar@@ ry the front days of concern .
My mother took on my face and she looks at me every morning in my mir@@ ror .
And all the morning , I di@@ g my eyes .
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died from cancer at 43 .
We constantly feel his protection , nothing serious can happen .
It was his promise on his be@@ ac@@ on of pain , so we slowly learned to s@@ mile , and pronoun@@ cing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I &apos;@@ m talking to him in the cru@@ x of the night when the absence is too bad , she inv@@ ites herself in my dreams when the mor@@ ale is a little reached .
We feel that we are being pushed and protected in difficult times , the decline of time makes us realize how much it was an or@@ che@@ str@@ a leader and we are trying to stay in the path she had outlined .
If a person liked you very strong , the absence can &apos;t gr@@ ind you with heart and memories .
In a way , being loved becomes your domestic energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 after asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked .
I cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t attend his in@@ hum@@ ation and three weeks after his death , I was giving birth to a little bo@@ y .
If I have my convictions sometimes different , I still wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things .
I also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me , it &apos;s impossible to go in the opposite direction , I don &apos;t sle@@ ep and I still wonder what he will think about it .
I don &apos;t know if I adopted the way of being or if I &apos;@@ m just like him : is it genetic ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like an alter@@ -@@ e@@ go , there was no need to talk between us .
In short , he &apos;s here everyday .
I feel his presence and that makes me happy .
It &apos;s almost thirty years since my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I had 28 years and our son 6 years old .
The immense pain that then inv@@ aded me has of course moder@@ ated but he &apos;s always close to me .
Very often he &quot; lan@@ ded &quot; in my dreams in such a precise way , so alive , I &apos;@@ m even sad@@ der to see that it was only a dream .
The other night , he asked me if I was going well , I told him no , he responded to me &quot; I &apos;@@ m coming down &quot; but with such a real voice that I wo@@ ke up as a surprise , sc@@ ared and I lit the sh@@ it lam@@ p and watched everywhere , convinced that it was going to happen .
I still live in the same house , and often , I feel observed and I go back to see if he is not there , I know he &apos;s him and I &apos;@@ m talking to him .
In all the parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy .
For nothing , I w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t leave this house where we were happy and where its spirit lives with me .
I have 58 years , I have always lived alone since his departure , he &apos;s and will remain love for my life .
I want to make it clear that I am soci@@ able with a responsible job , I &apos;@@ m fed up and I chair , I know , I &apos;@@ m grand@@ mother , I have lots of friends , but my heart and soul belong to her and I &apos;@@ m never talking about her except my son , and I &apos;@@ m never going to the c@@ eme@@ tery .

And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled , it will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also expand .
And what happens when a terrorism virus lives ? It &apos;s repeated .

Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years old , gave sensitive information to the l@@ ord of the crime . N@@ ei@@ l S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh about surveys of his activities related to drug trafficking after having compromised because of his habit of consuming co@@ c@@ ain@@ e .
The lawyer , who was named &quot; Bas@@ h &quot; and considered by the criminals as a &quot; major file &quot; , was arrested at his house in 2011 following police listening operations directed at S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , he represented during a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials have re@@ pai@@ red Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 years ago , by tabling three bag@@ s of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in the home of the lawyer in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , while he was attending a din@@ ner from Bar@@ re@@ au with colleagues .
Sur@@ ve@@ ys revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a &quot; regular consumer &quot; of this class drugs . After tests showed trac@@ es of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in his ha@@ ir , on his wal@@ let and on credit cards .
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought illegal information about the arrest of two men for the S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough account as well as one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were watched at the time by the police in an important investigation into a hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e trafficking in the coun@@ ties of Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Y@@ or@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
With 32 other men , they were then imprisoned after the police took the hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for an amount of 1.5 M £ , as well as more than £ 200 000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
T@@ it@@ ta , 42 years old , provided information to the criminals because he was worried that his drug addic@@ t will be exposed to the day .
Today , at Li@@ ver@@ pool &apos;s school in Li@@ ver@@ pool , T@@ it@@ ta , who works in the cabinet of For@@ bes . For@@ bes Solidarity located in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , fell in dis@@ thanks after being guilty on two charges of charges of obstacle to justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He admitted the possession of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e during a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he was regularly in phone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators followed the suspect and returned to the home of Di@@ t@@ ta and put drugs , pure to 60 % , under the b@@ ann@@ er of the lawyer in a black gol@@ f g@@ ang .
S@@ hor@@ tly after the deposit , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was regularly in phone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta who was at a din@@ ner at E@@ wo@@ id Par@@ k &apos;s so@@ cc@@ er , forum of the Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n club .
The lawyer went back home , discovered drugs and they got tele@@ ph@@ oned on new occasions .
The court heard that Di@@ t@@ ta was a &quot; regular consumer &quot; of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests showed trac@@ es of this class drugs . A in his ha@@ ir , on his wal@@ let and on his credit cards .
T@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but ni@@ ped co@@ c@@ ain@@ e . He said he talked about the alleged drug trafficking because he was his cli@@ ent and argued that their discussions were subject to a &quot; legal privilege &quot; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta missed his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit cards , but they were all se@@ ated and he was taken off a s@@ ample of ha@@ ir .
During an inter@@ rog@@ ation , he said he had an office at his house , as well as at his workplace and that it happened that clients call him at home for legal questions .
But the court heard testi@@ monies that he called major actors in the drug trade , some of whom he had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investig@@ ators were aware .
The Public Prosecutor An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : &quot; If someone has to know that you don &apos;t have to violate the law , it &apos;s a criminal lawyer . &quot;
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a pen@@ alist lawyer , and of having too much involvement with particular clients .
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking , but a drug trafficking providing drugs to its own lawyer .
Some of his communications will certainly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer .
But it went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not honour his profession , but he dis@@ hon@@ ed him .
He got too close to some clients , especially S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
Di@@ t@@ ta has denied any illegal ag@@ itation and said : &quot; If I was a corrupt lawyer , what I &apos;@@ m not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not have waited 3 hours , I would have done it immediately . &quot;
But after the hearing , the super@@ inten@@ ker Le@@ e Hal@@ le@@ ad of the Lanc@@ et of the Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re said : &quot; Mr. Di@@ t@@ ta has gone from a criminal lawyer to criminal himself as soon as he has started to buy drugs with criminal organisations . &quot;
His addiction to co@@ c@@ ain@@ e has compromised him forever and made it vulnerable to the motives of the leaders of organized criminal groups who have asked him to obtain valuable information about police investigation .
L@@ aw@@ yers should observe the highest integrity rules and create a climate of trust with the public .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta betra@@ yed this confidence and tried to shelter behind the ver@@ b@@ ies of his profession .
The serious and organized crime crime unit in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re conducted the investigation on Mr Di@@ t@@ ta , who was convicted of the three heads of charge of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and now hin@@ ders justice , showing his commitment to prosecute criminals in court .
That this case serves as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will translate to the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after having ple@@ aded guilty of complicity in hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in the traffic were sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years of prison for drug trafficking .
On his website , Di@@ t@@ ta organized a session / answers on himself during which he said that his dream would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America , his last gu@@ y at din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali and the inequality would motiv@@ ate him to work .

A sho@@ ot@@ ade took place at the international airport of L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es .
It was 10 : 00 in the morning when a man opened the fire .
According to the local police , there would be at least 2 injured .
It would be an employee working for the Administration for the Security of Transport of the United States ( T@@ SA ) and the author of the fire .
The incident occurred at the ter@@ minal 3 , causing a wave of panic .

The classic s@@ ong for teen@@ ag@@ ers
Every time , the school cli@@ en@@ te@@ le will be targeted , an initiative that had a lot of success during the previous season .
By means of five s@@ ay@@ n@@ et@@ tes imagined and interpreted by artists in the region , stic@@ kers with a high degree of hum@@ or , we allow teen@@ ag@@ ers to ap@@ p the classic s@@ ong .
Besides this show , the Kingdom &apos;s ly@@ ric@@ al art society will come back with its ly@@ ric@@ s , a formula that is now filled with the P@@ ul@@ per@@ ie of Chic@@ he@@ m@@ i .
Two other concer@@ ts will take place in the summer of 2014 , which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of .
In these activities , the ly@@ ric@@ al was added , the concer@@ t-@@ profit held last August , with the competition of so@@ cc@@ ano col@@ or@@ ature Mari@@ e-@@ E@@ ve M@@ un@@ ger .
It was acti@@ vit@@ y-@@ benefit , alongside the artistic dimension , and it helped the non-@@ profit organization to produce a financial balance sheet that is as swe@@ et in the ears as a fl@@ ash@@ -@@ m@@ ouse air .
Without giving any specific figures , the president of the management board , Y@@ ves Ber@@ ger@@ on , took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday , in Chic@@ he@@ ti@@ i , to be reassuring .
Despite the prec@@ ari@@ ousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions , the future is drawing up well , even in the long term .
We have more solid and constant ap@@ ps .
&quot; finances are af@@ lo@@ at and we hope to last until the 50@@ th anniversary of the com@@ ton , a step we will take in seven years &quot; , commented on the director .

New request for collective redress against the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x bro@@ thers
A new request for collective redress was lod@@ ged against the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x bro@@ thers , concerning sexual assa@@ ults that would have taken place this time at the or@@ bit Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h as well as in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the testi@@ mony of the shar@@ k , identified like &quot; J@@ . J . &quot; , who would have been m@@ asked in the 195@@ 0s , first at No@@ m D@@ ame@@ e-@@ des@@ -@@ Ne@@ i@@ ges by his prof@@ essor the bro@@ ther Sou@@ sted , then by his bos@@ s , the father , Ber@@ n@@ ard , at the or@@ atory Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h , where he was used for m@@ ass and where his father worked like pain@@ ter .
The first resort was only three establishments , and when we announced the regulation , many people told us : &quot; I was in this place , I can register myself ? &quot; , tell the lawyer Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ult , who defends the victims in both cases .
The collective appeal that has just been tabled is for the special reason to allow the addition of complain@@ ants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x aggreg@@ ation .
At present , the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assa@@ ul@@ ted by the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x bro@@ thers .
The alleged facts are usually older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the planned establishments closed their doors in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also stresses that the aggreg@@ ation of Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x and the or@@ atory Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h , which is a separate entity , &quot; have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &quot; , that they &quot; have exercised a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &quot; , that they &quot; knew about the sexual abuse perpetrated and have nevertheless stif@@ led them &quot; , and they &apos;@@ ve &quot; consci@@ ously and consci@@ ously chosen to ignore the problem &quot; .
The last accusations are based among others on letters written by the lawyer Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x , M@@ e É@@ mi@@ le Per@@ r@@ in , in the 9@@ 0s , but also by the sear@@ ches made in the archi@@ ves on this subject by bro@@ ther Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy , a former bro@@ ther of Sain@@ te@@ -@@ Cro@@ i@@ x who publicly denounced the abuse .
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of ad@@ mis@@ sibility in the superior court .
Once the Court ad@@ mits ad@@ mis@@ sibility , we take the second step , or the hearings on the merits .
In the case of the first resort , the con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation of Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ ro@@ i@@ x had agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ ably before hearings are conducted in the background .
Im@@ posing fire in a trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the L@@ Sal@@ le distric@@ ts , in Mon@@ tre@@ al , in Thursday &apos;s night at Friday .
Re@@ li@@ ef was called to 1@@ h , Friday , because of a fire that had declared the sub@@ soil of an Indian co@@ o@@ king restaur@@ ant on the aven@@ ue D@@ ol@@ ard , near the inter@@ section with the R@@ an@@ j@@ e street .
The 30 fire@@ men who were dis@@ pat@@ ched in the places took almost an hour to control the bra@@ si@@ er .
The fire &quot; caused significant damage to the construction structure &quot; , indicated the head of the operations of the Mon@@ tre@@ al fire security service , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in the restaur@@ ant when the fire@@ men arrived on the scene .
There were no injuries , but almost twenty homes , located in the first and second floor of this row of commercial premises , had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross was requested because the residents of one apar@@ tments could have to be temporarily temporarily , indicated the I@@ M .
Many opposition to medical assistance to die in the Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
The Canadian pal@@ lia@@ tive food cong@@ ress , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
This is the occasion for several pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reas@@ ser@@ t their disagreement .
If all the sick had access to effective care to calm their suffering , besides being able to stay at home , very few of them would like to put an end to their days , according to a spokesman of the Canadian Association of pal@@ lia@@ tive care , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ et@@ et@@ te .
If we were to focus on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the approach of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia would become minimal .
The president of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c Qu@@ ali@@ fications Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die .
If it is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ é@@ ry worries about the consequences for the next generations .
&quot; What is the meaning of life &quot; , regrets .
The majority of pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses will refuse to help patients die , according to the president of the pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses , Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e F@@ it@@ z@@ back .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ back , also director of the house Mat@@ thi@@ e@@ -@@ S@@ av@@ or@@ se in G@@ at@@ water , thinks that the service would be useless anyway .
We never ask : &quot; I want to die , give me an injec@@ tion &quot; .
The director of the pal@@ lia@@ tive care of the On@@ tari@@ o , Ri@@ ck F@@ ir@@ th , believes that the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c bill dis@@ ori@@ fies the population about the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He doesn &apos;t think the On@@ tari@@ o will follow suit .
For his part , the liberal deputy of G@@ ati@@ ne@@ au , St@@ é@@ ph@@ ania V@@ all@@ és , says that the notion of the end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press is indign@@ ant about the controversial media law
&quot; It &apos;s a frigh@@ tening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question : what will prevent Parliament from wi@@ ping out the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? &quot; , said the newspaper by challenging the bill and asking for it to be declared un@@ constitutional .
&quot; This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and very p@@ uni@@ tive , and we refuse it &quot; , explained C@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ au , director of Cap@@ it@@ tal Group .
He said that the new media court &quot; will always be biased because it &apos;s an extension of the government &quot; and the restrictions on content and publicity would harm Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and send him back to the parliamentarians &quot; , he added .
According to the newspaper The Sta@@ r , the new bill will allow the government to have &quot; media liter@@ acy &quot; . The Stand@@ ard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &quot; had suffered a hard blow &quot; and roc@@ ked the bill as &quot; d@@ rac@@ onian &quot; .
Ad@@ option of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the West@@ g@@ ate shopping center last September .
The Ken@@ yan media sti@@ r@@ red up the anger of the authorities by distributing pictures of video cam@@ era cam@@ era on which the troops deployed on the stage of the attack supposedly ev@@ ic@@ ted the luxury commercial center .
The police chief , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o , reacted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media officer to ask them , even though the calling was withdrawn following a release of b@@ alls in the media .
Under the new bill , the media can be pun@@ ishable by fines of up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &quot; radi@@ ated &quot; or of no longer being able to receive acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the property of a offen@@ der if he ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t paid his fine .
According to the D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , &quot; even one penalty is enough to paraly@@ se most F@@ M stations &quot; .
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; anim@@ ated blo@@ go@@ sphere &quot; .
By reducing the media silence , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
&quot; Nobody will ever know &quot; , wrote Mu@@ tu@@ ma Mat@@ thi@@ u , journalist at The N@@ ation , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of control in public life .
&quot; Li@@ v@@ é for themselves , politicians would put the country bankrupt and bring us back to hun@@ t and co@@ ol &quot; .
Ken@@ yan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of salaries and rein@@ stated their mi@@ gh@@ ty salaries of about 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month exempt from tax - which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmac@@ ists
The departure of almost 10 pharmac@@ ists at the C@@ enter of Health and Social Services ( CS@@ S ) from L@@ av@@ al caused a whole e@@ h to the head of the city of Ci@@ te@@ -@@ de-@@ la@@ -@@ Health , and this one , in the year 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
Because of multiple reti@@ rees , maternity leave or departure leave all short , the pharm@@ acy department has found itself highly defici@@ ent in staff .
There was almost 30 % of the necessary workforce , making this financial year &quot; very difficult &quot; according to the department of the department , G@@ illi@@ an Be@@ au@@ de@@ t .
However , the CS@@ S decided not to hi@@ re independent labor , which could cost up to three times more expensive than a full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist .
We did not use the breakdown , explained Mrs Be@@ au@@ d@@ et .
We ration@@ alized or reduced some of our activities inside the establishment to p@@ our them , the time when things happen .
It &apos;s sure that we worked hard to interest our young people &#91; residents in pharm@@ acy &#93; for them to come and stay here .
There is a competition of circumstances that made you in a bad situation last year .
improvement
After this ar@@ du@@ ous period , the year 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 announ@@ ces much easier for the CS@@ S pharm@@ acy department .
Already , three pharmac@@ ists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmac@@ ists have been hi@@ red in recent months .
In addition , the efforts of the department to remember have borne fruit , because the four students currently in residence in L@@ av@@ al also decided to stay at the job of the CS@@ S .
Now , it &apos;s going much better , stressed the pharm@@ acy .
By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity feedback .
This will make up for our departure from last year .
L@@ ess ever growing
The situation remains aw@@ es@@ ome , however .
Several factors , such as the shortage of pharmac@@ ists in hospital or a predomin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to forecast .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because we have a young background and we use a lot of young women , so with pregnan@@ cies , we almost always work with three maternity leave when it &apos;s fine , she added .
The last year , we had a lot more and we don &apos;t have pharmac@@ ists who are available to make re@@ plac@@ ements , so it was more difficult .

She tries to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls
Com@@ ing from the H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en day , a woman tried to bring two k@@ os of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into the country hidden in c@@ it@@ ches , Thursday morning , at the Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ dea@@ u Air@@ port .
It was when looking at the b@@ agg@@ age of the pass that drugs could be detected .
Co@@ c@@ ain@@ e had been distributed in three c@@ ous@@ ro@@ ls having previously been emp@@ tied .
The drugs were then transported to the office of the Ro@@ yal G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie of Canada ( G@@ R@@ C ) which took the bat@@ on in this investigation .
The Canada border agency of Canada ( AS@@ F@@ C ) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
It is part of the investigation , indicated Jacqu@@ el@@ ine Rob@@ y , spokesman of the AS@@ F@@ C .
What I can tell you is that she came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , the border agents at the Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ dea@@ u Air@@ port have carried out 17@@ 3 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 se@@ iz@@ ures of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , agents of border services in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region made a total of 16@@ 53 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs .
Air travel against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanon army , Israeli planes went into Lebanon &apos;s air space Wednesday at the beginning of afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A short-term S@@ -@@ air missile collection of SA@@ -@@ 8 would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new aviation ra@@ id in the Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli daily newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz ) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor by Syria .
The ra@@ id took place in circumstances that were almost identical to the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an an@@ onymous American official who confirmed to C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack , aimed at this time at sol@@ -@@ sea missiles Y@@ ak@@ h@@ have , delivered by Russia in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Israeli officials di@@ dn &apos;t hide their irrit@@ ation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora low@@ ered the credit rating of Ukraine on Friday , questioning the ability of the former Soviet re@@ public , in recession for more than a year , to face up to its financial obligations .
The rating of the country &apos;s public debt is going to &quot; B@@ - &quot; , sin@@ king into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative perspective , S &amp; P seeing at least one chance on three that it is again down in a year .
&quot; It &apos;s less and less likely that the government &apos;s strategy will allow enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs &quot; explains the American agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine &apos;s exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 and that the trend will continue .
This makes the reimbursement of credits abroad more difficult .
These reservations , to which the authorities resort mas@@ sively to support the local currency , the h@@ ry@@ v@@ ia , collap@@ sing , the agency finds it more and more likely to be de@@ valued , thereby inf@@ l@@ ating its external debt .
Ki@@ ev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia , which acc@@ uses him of not paying a bill of 8@@ 82 million dollars .
This announcement is bad news for the power of Ukrainian people in a period of heated tensions with its Russian neighb@@ or , fu@@ rious about Ki@@ ev &apos;s desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
She was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had experienced its fifth quarter of a series of contr@@ action between July and September .
His indeb@@ tedness , which is still relatively modest , has explo@@ ded in recent years and S &amp; P estimate it at 3@@ 3@@ .5 % of GDP , compared to less than 10 % before the crisis of 2008-@@ 2009 .
The country , in budget deficit , has for months been demanding the assistance of the International Monetary Fund , which granted him a loan of 15@@ .@@ 3 billion dollars in 2010 and for the moment only released 3.@@ 4 billion .
But the fund refuses to pay any new slic@@ e as long as the country has not adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , especially by increasing gas prices to the population .
At the end of a new unsuccessful mission in the country , the IMF saw this week that &quot; significant external financing needs &quot; were &quot; a vulnerability &quot; , while raising &quot; the signs of economic improvement &quot; .
However , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r J@@ ol@@ oud , from the Centre for Political Stu@@ dies , &quot; we can &apos;t wait for a short-term improvement &quot; .
&quot; There &apos;s little hope that unpopular reforms are launched in a pre-@@ election year &quot; , the presidential elections being planned in 2015 , is the expert , inter@@ viewed at the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
S &amp; P is also the &quot; uncertainty &quot; linked to the possible signature of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , that Brussels depends on the release of the opposition Y@@ ou@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
&quot; Sign@@ ing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium terms related to the reaction of Russia &quot; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &quot; trade restrictions &quot; from Moscow &apos;s part .
Russia , which represents the quarter of Ukrainian exports , warned that in case of creating a free trade area between the EU and Ki@@ ev , it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods .
United States &apos; Green Paper to the Pub@@ lic@@ is-@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m fusion
Pub@@ lic@@ s and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m said Friday did not have any objections from the American authorities to their fusion , moving closer to the creation of the first global publicity agency .
The fusion brings into effect the second global agency , O@@ m@@ nic@@ co@@ m , and the third , Public .
&quot; O@@ m@@ nic@@ co@@ m Group and Pub@@ lic@@ is Group have announced today the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the period of examination of the merger earlier announced by Pub@@ lic@@ is Group and O@@ m@@ nic@@ co@@ m , planned by the Har@@ t-@@ Scot@@ t-@@ Ro@@ d@@ ino Anti-@@ Pro@@ v@@ ince Act of 197@@ 6 , as amended &quot; , announ@@ ces the two groups in a communication .
They specify that they also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The exp@@ ir@@ ation of the examination period planned by the H@@ S@@ R in the United States and the authori@@ zation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several conditions necessary for the operation of the operation .
&quot; fusion is also dependent on the acquisition of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups &quot; .
The Congolese army hunting the rebels of M@@ 23
The Congolese army ( F@@ AR@@ DC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to cha@@ se the rebels from M@@ 23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u near Rwanda and Uganda .
The M@@ 23 appears on the point of being beaten after being hun@@ ted out from loc@@ alities from the north-@@ east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR@@ C ) that he controlled from the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insur@@ rec@@ tion .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re going to continue the M@@ 23 and up@@ load it wherever it &apos;s hidden because these are criminals &quot; , said to Re@@ u@@ ters the Col@@ on@@ el O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokesman of the F@@ AR@@ DC .
We shoul@@ dn &apos;t let them re@@ organize themselves because they &apos;@@ ve been mar@@ ching the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace back .
Those responsible for M@@ 23 explained having evac@@ uated the loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure and Ber@@ tr@@ and B@@ is@@ sim@@ wa , the political leader of the re@@ bel@@ lion , said on R@@ FI that these military set@@ backs would in no way alter his claims to the peace talks .
According to Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , the latter took on Wednesday in K@@ am@@ ala between the government of Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 .
C@@ ho@@ o@@ ks are reported in the h@@ ills that domin@@ ate B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the last loc@@ ality in the hands of the insur@@ gents to be dropped this week , as well as at the vic@@ inity of R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a h@@ ill where the re@@ bel@@ lion of the M@@ 23 saw the day in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , ma@@ ster@@ piece of the Nor@@ d Ki@@ v@@ u province , prof@@ iting from the flight of the government gar@@ ris@@ on and the p@@ assi@@ vity of the blue hel@@ me@@ ts of Mon@@ us@@ co .
The fall of G@@ om@@ a brought the United Nations Mission to the DR@@ C , the world &apos;s most important in terms of man@@ power , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention bri@@ g@@ ade composed of South African soldiers , mal@@ a@@ ise and T@@ anz@@ anian soldiers .
For its part , the headquarters of the F@@ AR@@ DC has been re@@ worked and the army has gone on the offensive against M@@ 23 , changing the course of war .
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&quot; The M@@ 23 seems to be tou@@ ching at its end &quot; , predicted an Congolese business expert , J@@ ose Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Si@@ as@@ a .
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government of Kin@@ sha@@ sa managed to fight a major insur@@ rec@@ tion .
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group alli@@ ed in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DR@@ C .
United Nations experts blame Rwanda , which den@@ ies it fier@@ cely , to support milit@@ arily the M@@ 23 , formed at the beginning of former Congolese soldiers mutilation .
British diplomacy , Wil@@ lia@@ m Jo@@ ke , invited the President of Rwanda Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to show restraint , announced a spokesman of the Foreign Office .
Last week , K@@ ig@@ ig@@ i mentioned the possibility of military re@@ tribu@@ tion following the sh@@ ell@@ s fallen in Rwanda .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana inv@@ aded the streets of the bour@@ g@@ ade to welcome the entry of the F@@ AR@@ DC soldiers .
&quot; We lived a year with M@@ 23 and we seemed un@@ imagin@@ able to be one day liber@@ ated by the army &quot; testi@@ fies to an inhabit@@ ant of this city &apos;s neighbors .
&quot; We lived in terrorism ( of M@@ 23 ) , we are tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tized &quot; , added this man .
The tests carried out by the P@@ ast@@ er Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the cor@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ us turned out to be negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It specifies that &quot; the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France so far &quot; .
Tuesday , this 4@@ 4@@ -year old patient was suspected of being reached , after having returned from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed 50 million deaths .
Ch@@ ev@@ ron , the second American oil company , reported on Friday a decrease in its quar@@ terly benefit because of the decrease in its refin@@ ing margins , while its production of oil and gas has increased while remaining behind the group &apos;s objectives .
His net benefit in the third quarter has reduced to $ 4.@@ 95 billion , or $ 2.@@ 57 per action , compared to $ 5.@@ 25 billion , or $ 2.@@ 69 per action , one year before .
The analy@@ sts asked by Re@@ u@@ ters aver@@ aged on average on a profit per action by $ 2.@@ 71 .
The group produced 2.@@ 59 million bar@@ rel@@ s of oil equivalent per day during the quarter , rising compared to 2.@@ 2 million P@@ M products produced a year ago .
The company aims for 2.@@ 65 million P@@ M for this year , with a 25 % growth in the expected production by 201@@ 7 .
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas projects in Australia .
Because of the cost of these projects , annual investment spending has increased by seven billion dollars in two years and should reach $ 3@@ 6.@@ 7 billion in 2013 .
The benefits of production activities have reduced slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of down@@ stream activities ( including food refin@@ ing and chemical production ) have fallen by 45 % to $ 3@@ 80 million .
This decrease in refin@@ ing margins affects the whole sector .
As a result , Ch@@ ev@@ ron &apos;s main competi@@ tor , Ex@@ xon M@@ ob@@ il reported on Thursday of a net benefit , in spite of the increase in his gas and oil production .
F@@ air of eco@@ lin@@ er : the complaint deemed admissible
The Scho@@ ol Commission of the region of the College of Sh@@ er@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( CS@@ R@@ S ) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the costs of $ 150 per student ( up to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for students benefiting from school transport to two homes , a service that the organization offers when it is able to do it .
Before the changes to the last budget , no financial contribution was requested .
&quot; There &apos;s a mediation service proposed by the committee and I was interested &quot; , explains Mrs L@@ ef@@ in .
According to her , the CS@@ R@@ S was invited to a medi@@ o@@ cr@@ e and she asked for another time to think about it .
&quot; It &apos;s always better to talk about it , talk and find solutions &quot; , says Mrs L@@ ef@@ in .
The school commission of the region of the College of Sh@@ er@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( CS@@ R@@ S ) did not want to comment .
The organization only meant that medi@@ ating is part of the process during a complaint .
Im@@ bro@@ bro@@ li@@ o about the closure of the emergencies of the H@@ ô@@ el@@ -@@ God
Faced with the head@@ long run by a portion of the staff and several unions , including the C@@ G@@ T , the Minister of Health , Mar@@ is@@ l T@@ our@@ ain@@ e , decided on 10 July to &quot; shift the timetable for the implementation of the project , and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that can &apos;t take place on 4 November &quot; .
officially done request &quot; to do not run any risk of taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &quot; but also aimed at not anno@@ ying the PS campaign to a few months from the municip@@ als .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should still be effective on that date .
Even if , at the A@@ PH@@ P , we prefer to use the term &quot; transformation &quot; or &quot; change in continuity &quot; .
From 4 November , the fire fire@@ men who carried out about a quarter of 40 000 annual pass@@ ages in the emergencies of the H@@ ô@@ el@@ -@@ God <unk> will all have received a sign to take the 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other hospitals Paris .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the inter@@ na@@ ils .
At Ho@@ el@@ el@@ -@@ God , the speci@@ alized in@@ ner cities will leave on Monday to five internal medicine in general .
As for the transfer of be@@ ds of internal medicine , it is planned for the current month .
&quot; The H@@ ô@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God emergency service must close in the shor@@ test time period , and for us , it &apos;s 4 November &quot; , as@@ sho@@ le , right away , Lo@@ c@@ ic C@@ afternoon , the president of the Committee of Inquiry &apos;s Med@@ ical Committee ( EM@@ E ) , which supports the management project .
&quot; On 4 November , there will be no more patients brought by fire@@ men , only people coming from their own means &quot; , confirms Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical officer of the new Ho@@ sp@@ é@@ -@@ God .
&quot; But we &apos;@@ ll continue to welcome patients as a matter of urgency &quot; , temp@@ ts him to assert the permanent presence of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R vehicles on the spot to transfer serious cases .
senior emergency doctors will stay on the spot , he also ensures .
But it &apos;s up to AR@@ S to decide the closure of the emergency service for emergencies .
&quot; Things are progressively done &quot; , responds Nicol@@ as Pé@@ j@@ u , spokes@@ person for the AR@@ S for whom , on 4 November , &quot; there will be no change in terms of service rendered . &quot;
&quot; The minister li@@ ed us or he li@@ ed him &quot; , deplo@@ res the emergency doctor of the doctor .
D@@ em@@ on@@ str@@ ating of his position as leader of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R in early July for leading the front against the re@@ organisation project , he defines himself as an &quot; al@@ er@@ t alert &quot; against a &quot; cynical &quot; decision taken by &quot; the medi@@ a-@@ administrative techno@@ structure . &quot;
&quot; They are v@@ ou@@ cher and as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ating emergencies that were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &quot; , he considers .
For him , &quot; if the other emergency services Par@@ is@@ ian could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &quot; .
But they are regularly locked up .
For example there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the emergencies of L@@ ari@@ boo@@ ère .
At the AR@@ S , we claim that 30 &quot; dis@@ pat@@ ched &quot; patients on several sites can &apos;t represent an &quot; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &quot; in other emergency services , the human resources of which have also been strengthened .
At the AR@@ S as well as the A@@ PH@@ P , we defend the &quot; new hospital model &quot; already launched since 7 October and which should continue to welcome 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , the general liberal doctors should also come and participate in the creation of a &quot; permanent healthcare &quot; .
&quot; Where are you going to do if people ask people to diagno@@ se themselves &quot; , ask themselves G@@ ér@@ ard Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek for whom &quot; the emergency concept not serious &quot; is &quot; dangerous &quot; and marks a &quot; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &quot; .
This will happen as for level 3 maternity hospitals .
People are not cra@@ zy , they &apos;@@ ll go where there is the best offer of care .
If the minister doesn &apos;t take any measure by Monday , we &apos;@@ re going to change the bra@@ ke , warn Chris@@ top@@ he P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , doctor doctor and member of the C@@ G@@ T Health .
We &apos;@@ ll be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about submitting a list .
In the N@@ ath@@ ali@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ oriz@@ et team , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , U@@ M@@ P coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or of Paris and elected of the 4@@ th distric@@ ts , clearly announ@@ ces that &quot; even if the U@@ M@@ P Par@@ is@@ ian was in favor of maintaining emergencies at the H@@ ô@@ el@@ -@@ God , it would be technically and financially impossible to re@@ open them if you come back to responsibility &quot; .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the PS candidate , has again reminded France on Monday morning that she had pronounced himself in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 November .
If it was the case , it would mark its net disagreement , stresses B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , its spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of the Ho@@ sp@@ é@@ -@@ God has its legitimacy in the background , we can &apos;t admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama puts an end to the listened to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to put an end to the listened to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicate an American official , Thursday .
This decision is part of the attempt of the White House to take up your hand in the affair of the N@@ SA listen after the re@@ vel@@ ations made by the former analy@@ st Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , refugee in Russia .
This is the first time that the supervision of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal .
Inter@@ ro@@ ted on the subject , a manag@@ er of the US administration replied : &quot; The United States does not carry out electronic monitoring aimed at the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &quot; .
Speaking under the an@@ onym@@ ity , this official di@@ dn &apos;t specify if such monitoring had been put in place in the past .
Another official said that Barack Obama had given an order to stop these practices in the past weeks .
This investigation was given almost at the same time as the one ending the ta@@ pping of the UN &apos;s headquarters in New York .
In this context , the Sen@@ lat@@ er@@ orial Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs on Thursday but allowed them to continue .
The commission introduced new restrictions on data that the intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a limit of five years for the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new objectives for fighting poverty
The United Nations will now set to work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( M@@ DG ) , which had been put in place 12 years ago to fight against poverty in the world .
Austr@@ ali@@ an diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the M@@ DG , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on sustainable development that started the day before Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They were in the final preliminary draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , during the summit .
UN Secretary General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to &quot; go beyond national interests &quot; .
&quot; I am happy that the Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals ( O@@ D@@ D ) , he added .
These O@@ D@@ D will rely on progress made within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do the best to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to realize our vision of the objectives of sustainable development that rely on the success of the M@@ DG .
The security concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts break between powerful person@@ alities
In the feet of the stat@@ ue of S@@ am@@ ou@@ a M@@ ach@@ el , the foun@@ der president of the Mozambique , making them fit them , thousands of people gathered in the center of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to to sha@@ ke peaceful slog@@ ans during a rare public demonstration .
&quot; We want peace to come back ; we want stability &quot; , said V@@ an@@ ess@@ a from Sou@@ sa , the general director of an investment society .
In@@ qu@@ is@@ te for the future of his country , she exchanged her work clo@@ thes against a te@@ -@@ shir@@ t with the mention &quot; we want security &quot; in Portuguese before joining the am@@ assed crow@@ d in the place of Independence of the capital Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and the Ren@@ o , the worst con@@ sign@@ ments since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago .
The Ren@@ o was once a famous re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous movement , supported initially by R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia governed by wh@@ ites then the apar@@ theid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabili@@ ze the country &apos;s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , she became an opposition party .
An@@ aly@@ sts think that the country should not fall into an open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north west could attract more than 50 M@@ od of investments in the next few years from companies like Rio T@@ int@@ o , V@@ ale of Brazil , Italy , Italy and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko of the United States .
The F@@ eli@@ m@@ o , the governing party and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and the Ren@@ o reject each other &apos;s responsibility for tensions .
The Ren@@ o states that the government is behind recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , a traditional str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of the Ren@@ o , on 17 October .
The assa@@ ults on the former rebels then de@@ generate when the government forces attacked the bases of the Ren@@ o and tried to kill A@@ on@@ so D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the leader of the group , and Fer@@ nan@@ do Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , the spokesman of the Ren@@ o , according to the Financial Times .
The government makes it responsible for triggered conflicts , and blam@@ es it to attack soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to minim@@ ize concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za said on Wednesday to the A@@ F@@ P , the French press agency , that Mr. D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama considered himself as a &quot; los@@ er &quot; who wanted to use &quot; all the forces he left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions in government &quot; .
The F@@ ili@@ m@@ o and the Ren@@ o insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern was growing after Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that the Ren@@ o gave up the 1992 peace agreement .
He said to the F@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the F@@ eli@@ m@@ o .
&quot; We want to resume the negotiations , but with the greatest seriousness &quot; , said Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
previous discussions between the parties have not managed to calm the tensions fu@@ elled by a series of conflicts this year .
&quot; These are two big men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who don &apos;t stop arguing &quot; , explained Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ an@@ l@@ on , a conf@@ conf@@ ment of the Op@@ en and specialist university in Mozambique .
None of them knows well negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
The Ren@@ o , which is in favor of electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are planned next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to get concessions and a trea@@ sure of war by the government .
The portion of the votes collected by the R@@ Ren@@ o has constantly fallen since 1992 , while a new party , the Democratic Movement of the Mozambique ( M@@ D@@ M ) that was created by a former Ren@@ o member , should get more votes in the elections .
Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Mr. Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who should take off at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&quot; He doesn &apos;t want a multi-@@ party democracy , he doesn &apos;t want transparent elections , he doesn &apos;t want peace because he doesn &apos;t want to leave the presidency &quot; said Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
We don &apos;t know exactly what the Ren@@ o &apos;s capacity is , but it has led to clear , disrup@@ tive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-@@ south motor@@ way axis .
Most of the cl@@ ass@@ room took place in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , which is located several hundreds of miles north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where is Be@@ ira , the port where mining companies , especially Rio T@@ int@@ o and V@@ ale , export coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Ren@@ o threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was badly sh@@ it@@ ty when asked if the Ren@@ o would rec@@ reate this threat .
The Ren@@ o wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , &quot; said Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
instability has reinforced the fru@@ stra@@ tions raised by the government , says Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , the director of Me@@ di@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media society , many people are also worried about corruption , the slow@@ ness of development and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; People think that the leaders of the country &apos;s future are the government and the president , and that it &apos;s up to him to find solutions to the problems &quot; , he explained .
Om@@ ar S@@ ul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstration , said that people only want stability .
&quot; Nobody ca@@ res about the Ren@@ o nor the F@@ eli@@ m@@ o , they just want to find peace , they want to have free access to the roads &quot; , he added .
The my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds to children should be taught as &quot; lifestyle models &quot; , says the author .
T@@ ho@@ r &apos;s L@@ é@@ g@@ é@@ de could show that &quot; the brutal force doesn &apos;t give weight to sub@@ tle ru@@ ins &quot; , while Ar@@ th@@ ur@@ an le@@ gen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
Know@@ ing that many my@@ ths would be &quot; far too violent , far too scandalous and in some cases , far too obscure to be taught at school &quot; , Cro@@ s@@ le@@ y-@@ Hol@@ and recommended a &quot; careful selection &quot; of works adapted to age .
&quot; I think it &apos;s great that in America , my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education &quot; , he said .
I &apos;@@ ve been advocating this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are &quot; openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &quot; makes the children &quot; completely un@@ load &quot; , the messages being &quot; sub@@ li@@ ed &quot; in pleasant stories .
C@@ ros@@ le@@ y-@@ Hol@@ and , who translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon and wrote The Pen@@ gu@@ in Bo@@ ok of Nor@@ s My@@ ths and British F@@ ol@@ k T@@ ales , said : &quot; You may have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight . &quot;
Maybe the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything has to be simplified or end well , but there is an un@@ born meaning of good and bad .
And it must be sub@@ li@@ ed ; revealed through a story rather than declared .
The known basis of what we show and that we don &apos;t say .
A figh@@ ter of the armed arm of Hamas was killed tonight and another w@@ ounded by a sho@@ oting of Israeli c@@ ats in the Gaza stri@@ p , have learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they su@@ ed a sh@@ it of sh@@ it from an Israeli Israeli .
S@@ hit of the N@@ SA : the United States is &quot; went too far &quot; , ad@@ mits Ker@@ ry
The United States has sometimes gone &quot; too far &quot; when it comes to sp@@ ying , recognised Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in this first Washington conf@@ ession in controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the United States and their European allies , this is the first time a US government official explicitly ad@@ mits controversial practices in the N@@ SA inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and data in Europe .
&quot; In some cases , I admit you , as the president did , some of these actions went too far and we &apos;@@ ll make sure that it doesn &apos;t happen in the future &quot; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London that he participated in since Washington on Thursday , 31 October with video connection .
In his re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous speech , in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Jo@@ ke , the head of American diplomacy was very justified in justi@@ fying intelligence and information collection practices by the necessary counter-@@ terrorism and prevention against possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ king the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry assured that the American authorities had since thwar@@ ted many terrorist projects thanks to communications inter@@ c@@ eption and information collection .
&quot; We have made it impossible for aircraft to fall , for buildings to explo@@ de and for people to be killed , because we were able to be aware of these projects in advance &quot; , argued the bos@@ s of American diplomacy .
And , said John Ker@@ ry to the Europeans , &quot; I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been mistaken &quot; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&quot; And yes , in some cases , it went too far in an inappropriate way &quot; , still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured me on Thursday night that President Obama was &quot; solved to try and clarify and to review these practices so that nobody feels wrong &quot; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to inf@@ late this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
The newspaper , which mentions documents obtained from the former consul@@ tant of the N@@ SA Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , says that the programme called &quot; M@@ US@@ C@@ U@@ L@@ U@@ R &quot; , and led with the British counterpart of the N@@ SA , the G@@ C@@ H@@ Q , allows these two agencies to recover data from the op@@ tic fi@@ ber used by internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , some 18@@ 1 million elements were collected during the last month of January - ranging from meta@@ data on e-@@ ma@@ ils , elements of text or audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ cep@@ tions would take place outside the United States .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google have denied any link to these practices .
For 10 days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , or Italy have revealed that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted mas@@ sively from data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders , especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states and while lea@@ ks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such listen , Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
On the other hand , the bos@@ s of the powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ e@@ ith Alexander , has denied him that his intelligence agency has cap@@ tured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even sent the ball to the European intelligence services who would have taken on these communications , before providing them with the N@@ SA .
This would concern &quot; military operations &quot; in countries where NATO allies collaborate with the United States and it would not be aimed at Europe at all , affir@@ med General Alexander .
And the controversy spread on Friday to Asia .
Indonesia sum@@ mon@@ ed the ambassador of Australia , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international es@@ pion@@ age network that has also spar@@ ked off China .
Paris Sain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ t will receive L@@ ori@@ ent on Friday without his master asset , the Swedish , Z@@ la@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , announ@@ ces the club of League 1 in a communication .
P@@ S@@ G , the leader of the champion in front of Mon@@ ac@@ o unlike goals , has spread the list of players selected for this match of the 12@@ th day , without it being the att@@ ack@@ er of 32 years .
The communication simply states that it &apos;s &quot; w@@ ounded &quot; without specifying the nature of the w@@ ound .
However , he was suffering from an inf@@ lam@@ ation of the left wing when he came back to selection , at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony in memory of the dead
Fa@@ ther L@@ ac@@ ha@@ ise &apos;s cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um organiz@@ es , at 11 : 00 , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the dead created in his establishment , during the year .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , Socialist candidate in the Paris city city must attend , and then explain , during a press conference , her proposals on fun@@ eral .
To follow the ceremony , c@@ lic@@ k above .
For their own ob@@ session , more and more French people choose the creation , rather than the in@@ hum@@ ation : 53 % , according to an I@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people , instead of 47 % .
For the friends of the near , it &apos;s the opposite : the French prefer hum@@ ation ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book La Mor@@ t in ash , Dam@@ n Le Gu@@ ay , a philosop@@ her and deputy of the National Committee of E@@ th@@ n@@ ic E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &quot; violence &quot; that is the creation , for the survi@@ v@@ ors .
There is , with the creation , &quot; a violence against the loved body &quot; , which will be &quot; reduced to a lot of ash &quot; in a very short time , and not after a process of dec@@ re@@ ation , which &quot; would &quot; accompany the stages of the m@@ our@@ ning &quot; .
There is also &quot; a symbolic violence &quot; , which is related to &quot; er@@ ased the speci@@ ality and the distinc@@ tive signs &quot; reduced to &quot; an@@ onym@@ ity &quot; of the ash .
Why is what is accepted without pain in certain Nordic countries and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts , is it still a bad experience in France ?
&quot; Because the creation is a new fact &quot; , responds Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ é@@ ri@@ que B@@ ack@@ é , Cha@@ ir@@ person of the Society of Th@@ an@@ at@@ ology and the author of the book .
It has been tolerated only since 19@@ 63 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to ap@@ portion it .
To call for the creation is for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mic@@ hael N@@ ér@@ ard , director of the fun@@ eral services of the City of Paris , to plan for the dem@@ un@@ t a ceremony as worthy as the one he would be entitled to with an in@@ hum@@ ation .
The I@@ p@@ so@@ s annual investigation shows a very strong att@@ achment to the organisation of the ceremony .
77 % of French people want one , for their loved ones , be they religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of people who choose a creat@@ or want to organize a ceremony .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s want it too .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ ums adapted to this evolution of society .
&quot; For a dozen years , they &apos;@@ re trying to avoid families the violence of a wait , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the release of the ash &quot; , obser@@ ves Mr. Mic@@ hael N@@ ér@@ ard .
70 % of establishments now offer cere@@ mon@@ ial ma@@ sters , who carry out , in the presence of the body , the following rit@@ u@@ el : to host the assembly , to name the dead , to link it to the others , to talk about it , give meaning to its death , organize the f@@ are@@ well .
This is the case with the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the L@@ ère L@@ ac@@ ha@@ ise , since 1998 .
The ceremony ma@@ sters are often people who have re@@ converted .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It &apos;s in this context that the creat@@ or@@ um of the L@@ ère L@@ ac@@ ha@@ ise organize , since 2010 , the day of La T@@ ous@@ s@@ ain@@ t , several cere@@ monies of memory , secular and non-@@ religious , to which he inv@@ ites the families of the people who were created in the year .
For the second year running , one of these cere@@ monies is passed on to the attention of those who could not travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um allowed us to rela@@ x it .
In La Se@@ y@@ ne , the down@@ fall because of r@@ ats comes to the controversy
At the beginning of the week , a family left its a@@ partment at the top of the F@@ ru@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 building , because of the presence of r@@ ats .
Faced with the urgency of the situation , the director of the South W@@ ars Office . H@@ ab@@ it@@ at , proposed in an exceptional and temporary way to rela@@ x the couple and his three children in a T@@ 4 new .
Yet the family refuses &quot; for financial reasons &quot; and the situation is blocked .
The affair has taken on exaggerated proportions , says Jo@@ el Can@@ ap@@ a , the director of the office .
There have always been r@@ ats , there are always in the cities .
The corpor@@ ation company makes two pass@@ ages per year , and in addition , we are inter@@ acting with every demand from the inhabitants .
We made 64 speeches since the end of last winter .
The neigh@@ bor@@ hood is not allowed to give up , and the r@@ ats don &apos;t sp@@ ill over into the city .
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health , re@@ nation@@ ation products are four times less effective than in the past , of course , but for two r@@ ats , we won &apos;t kill a friend .
&quot; We di@@ dn &apos;t agree the r@@ ats at home &quot; defend the father of family who left his house to settle for the ho@@ tel .
We &apos;@@ re soon without the money and we expect a new housing , at the same time as the old one .

A house pre@@ y of fl@@ ames in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
A fire that started on Friday noon in the Vi@@ u@@ x@@ -@@ Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c was quickly controlled .
More than a 30 fire@@ men were sent to the 9 of the street .
The fl@@ ames declared themselves in a house of three homes spread on four floor floor sites behind the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c &apos;s court .
Not all ten@@ ants were present at the fire .
The fire was ma@@ stered an hour after the arrival of fire@@ men , many of them to intervene .
As soon as our first fire@@ men arrived , they really saw the apparent smoke .
&quot; So the al@@ arms have succeeded , because it used to be strengthened to attack the building , because it &apos;s col@@ oured buildings here &quot; , explained France Lo@@ c@@ el@@ le , spokesman for the fire@@ men in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire .
Ben Green@@ man : 10@@ th anniversary of New York .
We could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand@@ -@@ up in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the de@@ vice of v@@ ou@@ d@@ le Fr@@ ank F@@ ay , who held the role of master of ceremony in the Pal@@ ace The@@ at@@ re , on Bro@@ ad@@ way , was starting to talk directly in front of the public , on your convers@@ ation .
The innovation of F@@ ay has continued over the years , until the New York F@@ es@@ red@@ y F@@ es@@ ti@@ val is taken up more recently .
Cre@@ ated and over@@ seen by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ sch , the foun@@ der of the stand@@ -@@ up club Car@@ ol@@ ines , the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and great theat@@ res .
&quot; Most of the heads of post@@ er emerged in Car@@ ol@@ ines , and had a great success , until they became too famous to play in a club &quot; , said H@@ ir@@ sch .
We created this f@@ es@@ ti@@ val to be able to continue working with them .
This year &apos;s event will see the participation of W@@ anda Sy@@ k@@ es , K@@ ath@@ y G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in and Bill Mah@@ er and the presentation of &quot; Stan@@ d U@@ p for Her@@ es &quot; , a party of com@@ edy and music for the benefit of former combat@@ ants , organized in Mad@@ ame Sau@@ den , which will be present , among others , B@@ ru@@ ce S@@ pre@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , Ro@@ ger W@@ af@@ ers and Bill C@@ ros@@ by
The f@@ es@@ ti@@ val took on the scale , just like the world of the com@@ edy .
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s f@@ es@@ ti@@ val have gone through non-@@ traditional channels , for example by showing shows on small TV channels , like Com@@ ed@@ y C@@ en@@ al , F@@ X and S@@ pi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ ro@@ ll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a t@@ t@@ co@@ m on a c@@ able channel ( &quot; The League &quot; on the theme of fant@@ asy fan@@ ta@@ si@@ e so@@ cc@@ er in the F@@ X@@ X channel ) and now has his own show of sk@@ et@@ ch@@ s on Com@@ ed@@ y C@@ entr@@ al .
Jen@@ y S@@ la@@ te participated in the &quot; St@@ it@@ day Ni@@ gh@@ t Li@@ ve &quot; program and was part of the &quot; Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation &quot; series , but she is still known for her series of vir@@ al vide@@ os &quot; Mar@@ c@@ el the S@@ hell with S@@ ho@@ es . &quot;
K@@ ro@@ ll and S@@ l@@ ite , as well as other young com@@ edy com@@ edi@@ ans in the sing@@ ular voice ( the sur@@ real pessimis@@ tic An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k , the ironic defen@@ der of racial justice . K@@ am@@ au Bel@@ l ) , are pur@@ ses of the decentralised world of the American com@@ edy .
One of the main attr@@ actions of the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val this year will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg discussing with Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy , but he became a cinema and television director accomplished , as well as an u@@ gly histor@@ ian of the com@@ edy .
Between 2005 and 2007 , he anim@@ ated a program on TV L@@ and that was called &quot; S@@ it D@@ own Com@@ y with David Ste@@ in@@ berg . &quot;
The appointment takes place at the Ho@@ tel de V@@ ille , in the center of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
&quot; The city is definitively in the com@@ ic DNA of all the work of L@@ ar@@ ry , &quot; said Ste@@ in@@ berg .
He told me that when he was here , sometimes he came down a ru@@ il between two building blocks and said himself , if I lose all my money , maybe I &apos;@@ ll live here .
The price of oil continues to decline and is close to $ 96 .
The price of oil continued to decrease Friday while the concerns about the importance of stocks compensated for a report showing that the energy-@@ intensive Chinese manufacturing sector is strengthening .
The price of the American reference gross for delivery in December fell from 14 c@@ ents to 9@@ 6.@@ 24 $ the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Ex@@ change ( N@@ Y@@ ME@@ X ) .
The contract lost 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it with a 5.@@ 8 % decrease for October .
The abund@@ ant supply of crude oil has weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
The American energy department indicated Wednesday that American supplies had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday , which show a growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to recover after the growth has increased to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a decrease that we had not known for two decades in the previous quarter .
The crude B@@ rent , a reference for the international gross crude already used by the American refin@@ eries , has lost 26 c@@ ents to fall to $ 10@@ 8@@ ,@@ 58 per bar@@ rel on Inter@@ -@@ Contin@@ ental Ex@@ change ( IC@@ E ) in London .
L@@ im@@ iting the right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as
A federal court of call rein@@ stated T@@ ex@@ as certain restrictions on the voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week .
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The judgment by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that doctors who will practice I@@ V@@ G will have to have an &quot; admission privilege &quot; with local hospitals .
The privilege of ad@@ mitting is the right of a doctor , by virtue of his status as a member of a hospital hospital , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center to give them a diagnosis or treatment .
F@@ V@@ G supporters argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the clin@@ ics of the state because these clin@@ ics have not managed to get this &quot; admission privilege &quot; for their practi@@ tioners .
In total , it would be about 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments .
Monday , a judge of first instance estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the admission privilege were un@@ constitutional .
But the At@@ tor@@ ney General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who pres@@ ses the position of Govern@@ or , asked the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to cancel the first instance judgment that blocked the application of the law .
A plenary session on this question is planned for January .
The New Sta@@ r managed to get a return in force , side by side , with 1.3 million view@@ ers behind their TV station , or 5.@@ 6 % of audience .
But was the show at the meeting ?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves to the hearings of this 10@@ th season , to face the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ e , the S@@ int@@ er S@@ inc@@ le , the los@@ er An@@ dr@@ é Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
S@@ or@@ ry the exc@@ itation of finding their fav@@ or@@ ite program , many were disappointed .
But why so much disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked during this first premium .
As every year , the first hearing broad@@ casts bre@@ ed a wide choice of we@@ ed sing@@ ers , for the best and sometimes for the worst .
But on T@@ wit@@ ter , we want show , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fortunately , some people found their account .
Many of them have tried the New Sta@@ r , and sometimes even went to the end .
Beh@@ ind the TV scre@@ ens , successful sing@@ er voc@@ ations are still there , season after season .
Others just have the ambition to lau@@ gh .
The court blocks a decision on the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and control policy .
A federal court court blocked on Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the programme of control and sear@@ ches of the New York Police Service and drew the file .
The United States &apos; Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) has indicated that the decision of the judge So@@ ra Sch@@ ee@@ lin was suspended until the call of the city .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program aimed at controlling and questioning the citizens .
The city appe@@ aled to its conclusions and its correct ordin@@ ances , including a decision to allocate a contro@@ ller to help the police department change its policy and the associated training programme .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al heard the arguments on the request for suspension .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al said that the judge had to be drawn from the file because she violated the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , partly because of a series of inter@@ views in the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court &apos;s criticism .
The judge ruled that police officers were infr@@ inging the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and original origin as part of their control and search program .
She appointed an external contro@@ ller to monitor the changes , especially the reform of policies , training and supervision , and she ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cam@@ er@@ as on the body in the neigh@@ bor@@ hoods where the highest number of controls are taking place .
In August , the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the call from the city should take place after March 14 2014 .
The control and search tac@@ tic has been criticized by many supporters of civil rights .
This control and search system has been in existence for decades in a certain form , but the number of controls recorded increased dramatically under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ er@@ g , to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls that related mainly to black and original men .
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into a collective action .
The supporters advocating changes in the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and search program say that they will put an end to unjust practices , allow to have more effective police forces and to be tru@@ sted , and will be able to change the way police departments use politics .
The opponents say that these changes would undermine the mor@@ ale of the police without lowering crime , would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police officers have been greatly reduced over the last decade .
The judge pointed out that she did not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but that she was reforming the way the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D was implementing its controls .
The ten@@ ants have to vote , because each of them spends on average $ 100 per month on the price of housing that goes to the V@@ ille .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ 000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des this amount between each housing .
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes .
By going to vote , we send a clear message .
We need to change things to the V@@ ille .
All the candidates told us that they would attack the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay fire@@ works to $ 100@@ ,000 , land of 4 to 5 million $ in case ...
G@@ o to vote , it &apos;s the best way to express you and say that it &apos;s enough .
F@@ ine of service for the co@@ ok head of the E@@ ly@@ see
En@@ sum@@ ed in the 500 m@@ 2 of the el@@ y@@ se@@ an co@@ o@@ ks as committed after working in emb@@ ass@@ y , the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en has eng@@ ra@@ ved all the lad@@ der until the head becomes a leader , nine years ago .
He served six French presidents , from Ge@@ org@@ es P@@ om@@ pid@@ ou to Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de via Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , including in their vac@@ ation places , and fed an inc@@ al@@ cul@@ able number of people in this world in a qu@@ an@@ tu@@ m an@@ onym@@ ity that he only breaks today , at retirement age , at 60 .
M@@ an with open face , un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited nur@@ ser@@ y and intellectual gl@@ asses , born on 24 October 195@@ 3 to St@@ é@@ te@@ -@@ Sain@@ t-@@ A@@ bi@@ in is holder of a CA@@ P of pa@@ stry .
His mother was herself co@@ o@@ king in a S@@ hel@@ le of So@@ onia .
&quot; I went from a house to the other ! &quot; , ir@@ on@@ ise Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ ghts , who knows not only the protests of the six presidents for whom he has officer , but also of their wi@@ ves and some of their illu@@ stri@@ ous gu@@ ys .
&quot; It &apos;s always the head of the state or his partner or wife who choo@@ ses men@@ us &quot; , remember .
&quot; Mrs Chirac was a bit more involved , she came directly into co@@ o@@ king &quot; , to the point she banned women in the co@@ o@@ ks of the E@@ ly@@ see !
Re@@ turning to the heads of state who displayed relative indifference to ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al food , &quot; they &apos;@@ re all gre@@ edy &quot; , denoun@@ ces Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ ghts gently .
Jacques Chirac certainly had &quot; a slightly more developed appe@@ ti@@ te &quot; .
But with Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , who sup@@ pressed che@@ ese , the girls were coming back empty !
As for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de , who rein@@ stated che@@ ese , &quot; he &apos;s someone who likes to eat &quot; and &quot; there &apos;s little he doesn &apos;t like . &quot;
The current head of the state , who has reg@@ ain@@ ed the k@@ ilo@@ grams lost before the presidential campaign , has &quot; no demand for a specific diet &quot; .
Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ ghts also remember the pressure on his shoulders , especially during state din@@ ners at the E@@ ly@@ see : you have to serve &quot; between 200 and 250 people in an hour about &quot; .
The first night is almost white .
These people would not understand if there were mistakes .
The former head of the E@@ ly@@ see k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , who took a glass on Tuesday night with his team , his family and friends , with a heart at the heart &quot; .@@ Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de came to gre@@ et me &quot; .
He said praise .
&quot; His human side came out &quot; , he says .
The bos@@ s will be replaced by his deputy , Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me G@@ ome@@ z , 35 years old , who has been for his part for 17 years at the E@@ ly@@ see .
In a house built in 18@@ 50 in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c
An historic house built in 18@@ 50 was the pre@@ y of fl@@ ames in the Qu@@ e@@ me@@ be@@ c on Friday noon .
The four homes building , located in the 15 of the street He@@ b@@ ert , was the subject of three al@@ arms at the fire service .
The fire said before , but it was on the three shel@@ ves of the building .
France Vo@@ is@@ le , spokes@@ person for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c Protection Service , said that the rapid intervention of fire@@ men helped avoid the spread of fl@@ ames in ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector of the city where the buildings are built in a closer way .
The bur@@ ned house was home to four homes , but no ten@@ ants found themselves on the spot at the time of the fire .
The damage was all limited , even if the water caused damage .
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin , but the down@@ ers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act .

C@@ ou@@ l@@ on used the phone ha@@ cking to check a tu@@ i@@ que .
The former ed@@ itor of Ne@@ ws of the World An@@ dy C@@ ou@@ l@@ on would have used &quot; the telephone ha@@ cking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; to try to confirm a bo@@ g@@ us tu@@ pes on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in office , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
The Do@@ c@@ ur@@ ur An@@ drew E@@ d@@ is Q@@ C said in the court of the O@@ ld B@@ ail@@ ley that Ne@@ ws of the World heard a false rum@@ or in May 2005 according to which C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ an@@ na@@ h P@@ w@@ l@@ by , his &quot; nice special advis@@ er . &quot;
It was pointed out to the court that the newspaper called G@@ len@@ n Mus@@ c@@ aire , a private de@@ vice , ha@@ c@@ ked off P@@ w@@ by &apos;s voice box and &quot; constantly planting front in front of his door &quot; , but C@@ ou@@ ll also called him and let him have voice messages .
&quot; The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ ou@@ l@@ son , who is now the ed@@ itor of No@@ t@@ W , is not the kind of man to stay in front of people &apos;s house in hoping to surprise them , it &apos;s the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they &apos;@@ re saying .
He said that No@@ t@@ W used three means to investigate the subjects : phone ha@@ cking , surveillance and confrontation .
The ed@@ itor is personally involved in the third .
It is obvious that he is aware of the second , monitoring , he can &apos;t be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is he aware of the telephone ha@@ cking ?
He claims the opposite , but we say &quot; Of course only if &quot; .
The rum@@ ors on a link involving C@@ lar@@ ke were taken first by the office office in No@@ t@@ W when a source , having a sexual attr@@ action against M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by , said that we told her : &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lose your time with her , she is with Charles . &quot;
A g@@ ang , on which the registered voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times , was se@@ ated at the house of Mus@@ c@@ aire in August 2006 .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ators also found se@@ iz@@ ures on the computer of the private de@@ vice that related to M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by and her s@@ ister row in a &quot; Pro@@ ject &quot; file .
During the period when the de@@ vice investigated her , M@@ iss P@@ w@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls where they were asked to have information on her , added Mr. Ed@@ it .
Meanwhile , the former re@@ porter Ne@@ vil@@ le Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former re@@ porter James We@@ a@@ er@@ up over@@ saw the monitoring of the least facts and actions of M@@ iss P@@ w@@ by .
In a voice message he gave him on 18 June 2005 , C@@ ou@@ ll said : &quot; I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow , which I would really like to talk about in Charles . &quot;
Mr Ed@@ it explained that the involvement of C@@ ou@@ l@@ son in history followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as the former Minister of the Interior David Bl@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury heard on Thursday that C@@ ou@@ l@@ son faced Mr. B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t about a link with a married woman when he was a co-@@ defen@@ der of the co-@@ defen@@ se Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ ou@@ l@@ on and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny having con@@ spir@@ ated with others to ha@@ ck tele@@ phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Mul@@ c@@ aire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ a@@ ther@@ up admitted to have carried out phone ha@@ c@@ kers .
Barack Obama gets the Prime Minister of Iraq , in the middle of a surge of violence .
The American president had to receive the Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki on Friday , 1 November 2013 , in search of help from the United States to fight against the strongest wave of violence for five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities .
9@@ 64 people died in the violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN gives an even higher balance sheet with 9@@ 79 deaths and 1 9@@ 02 w@@ ounded .
The violence is increasingly mur@@ der@@ ous despite increased security measures and massive military operations launched for months by the government of N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , dominated by the Shi@@ ites .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people were killed .
Ab@@ out two years after the withdrawal of American troops , the level of violence makes a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation fear while neighb@@ oring Syria is in a civil war .
The bombs hit markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ erals .
Men are shot in the middle of the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s about being politically margin@@ alized and being the target of unjust arrests , has encouraged this surge of violence .
On Friday , new violence killed four people in the north of Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explo@@ ding of five cars in the north of Baghdad .
A lot of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the L@@ ev@@ ant ( EI@@ I@@ L ) , a group aff@@ ili@@ ated to al-@@ Qaeda ( Sunni extremism ) , also involved in the civil war in Syria .
N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants a &quot; global war &quot; against al-@@ Qaeda .
The violence is at the center of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki that will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the American president , elected on the promise of ending the military engagement in this country , gave an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington , N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki has multi@@ plied the meetings with the executive , and the elected representatives of the Congress .
Thursday , he called for the international community to lead a &quot; third world war &quot; against al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a .
The principle of increased security for Iraq in the area of security is supported by influential republic@@ an sen@@ ators and democrats .
But the latter also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a sh@@ it , as@@ cri@@ bing the partial responsibility of the resumption of violence by his &quot; sec@@ tarian and authoritarian politics &quot; .
They also asked Barack Obama to make N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki understand that &quot; Iran &apos;s per@@ nic@@ ious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship &quot; .
Beijing acc@@ uses an U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur group of the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men attack
The head of internal security in China accused a group of the U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur separati@@ sts of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang on Friday to be behind the car bomb attack that made five deaths in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the center of Beijing Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V , has got rid of the crow@@ d that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital , a symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression waged in 1989 , and took fire killing its three passengers and two p@@ ants .
M@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the political office responsible for internal security issues , accused the Islamic movement of eastern Tur@@ ke@@ an to be the initi@@ ator of this attack .
Many U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ speaking minority inst@@ alled in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese province East Tur@@ ke@@ stan .
For the Chinese government , this movement is responsible for the frequent violence of violence that has taken place there with separati@@ st claims .
&quot; The violent terrorist episo@@ de that occurred in Beijing was organized and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &quot; , said M@@ g to the Mon@@ go@@ -@@ k@@ ong@@ e channel P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x TV .
&quot; The group held behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of eastern Tur@@ ke@@ an &quot; , he added , his statements were taken up by the new China agency .
The Chinese police identified the vehicle driver whose name suggests that he was of U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur origin and said that his wife and his mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained stories filled with g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine and a flag with or@@ thodox religious en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ments .
The incident did 42 w@@ ounded .
The Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ an movement is seen as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an sound on contrac@@ eption , divorce and homosexu@@ ality
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has undertaken to conduct a big survey around the world about how the par@@ ticles manage sensitive issues like contrac@@ eption , divorce and the sa@@ me-@@ sex couples of people of the same sex .
The survey asks the participants how the pri@@ ests deal with gay couples and their children , and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by the links of marriage .
The survey was sent in mid-@@ October to every national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , with the instructions to get as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important gathering on the family that the Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is plans to organize next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the &quot; National Ca@@ thol@@ ics Re@@ port &quot; , an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States .
A spokes@@ person for the Conference of Catholic b@@ ish@@ ops in the United States confirmed that the document was auth@@ enti@@ c and that every b@@ is@@ ho@@ p would decide the right way to think about par@@ is@@ si@@ es .
In the United Kingdom , b@@ ish@@ ops published the internet survey by asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .
DR@@ C : the army attack the last fi@@ ghts of rebels
The per@@ missi@@ bles of M@@ 23 , or a few hundred combat@@ ants , were taken off almost 2000 me@@ ter me@@ ter on the farm h@@ ills of Chan@@ nel , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bu@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ om@@ a , two loc@@ alities located around 80 km north of G@@ om@@ a , the capital of the North Ki@@ v@@ u province .
&quot; It has not stopped since this morning , the battles continue in spite of the night &quot; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P an inhabit@@ ant of J@@ om@@ a , join@@ ted by the phone at noon , and according to whom a gir@@ l@@ friend was injured by the bul@@ let in the morning .
&quot; The intensity of clashes has reduced a little &quot; , he added , &quot; it seems that the F@@ AR@@ DC For@@ ces of the DR@@ C have pushed the rebels a bit . &quot;
According to this witness wishing to remain an@@ onymous , the soldiers had &quot; past the night &quot; in J@@ om@@ b@@ a before going to the front for an &quot; Oper@@ ation operation &quot; .
There was a lot of talk behind him about the creat@@ ures of light weapons .
From B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , political fi@@ ef@@ le and last place of the re@@ bel@@ lion fell on Wednesday , a journalist from the A@@ F@@ P could listen to the de@@ ton@@ ations of heavy weapons .
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DR@@ C , the battles went &quot; in a final phase &quot; , the F@@ AR@@ DC having &quot; surrounded the positions of the M@@ 23 resid@@ u@@ als to remove them &quot; .
Since the recovery , on Friday , of clashes between the Movement of 23 Mar@@ s ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , Mon@@ us@@ co does not participate directly in the fighting , but it gives government troops a decisive support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several dozen soldiers , well equipped with am@@ muni@@ tion , were heading for the front line .
They were armed with k@@ al@@ ach@@ ni@@ kov and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road leading to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , post border with Uganda , soldiers who were ai@@ ded by civilians were loaded with a multi-@@ fac@@ eted roc@@ ket laun@@ ch@@ ment moun@@ ted on a new tr@@ uck tr@@ uck of the F@@ AR@@ DC , in order to ensure the point of another gir@@ l@@ friend po@@ oling the positions of M@@ 23 on the h@@ ills .
The Congolese president , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , called on Wednesday night once again to &quot; demo@@ bil@@ ise voluntarily &quot; or to be dis@@ armed &quot; by force &quot; , but let the K@@ am@@ ala process be opened , where Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been discussing it since December without results for now .
On the spot , the M@@ 23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement .
&quot; We finished the talks , it only remains for Ug@@ and@@ an mediation to organize the signature &quot; , said Ro@@ ger Lu@@ um@@ a , deputy of the M@@ 23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
M@@ 23 was born of a mutilation , in April 2012 , of former rebels , especially T@@ ut@@ si , integrated in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ig@@ i and K@@ am@@ pa@@ la refu@@ te .
The North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ ground is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mining resources .
In B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where there were about 5@@ 000 people between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the return movement to the DR@@ C that started in the morning reversed in the middle of day .
&quot; This morning we went back to our fields , but the soldiers told us to re@@ plic@@ ate &quot; , told the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ u@@ i , surrounded by its nine children , including a baby on the back .
We have the impression that the sho@@ ts are getting closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of inhabitants crossed the border , some with a match on the head , to spend the night in Uganda .
The mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy
C@@ l@@ assi@@ cal , sophisticated , popular , in English or in French , the s@@ ong and d@@ an@@ ced produc@@ tions take their flight .
After Bro@@ ad@@ way and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It &apos;s a revolution : the music to the French is affir@@ med as a kind of success .
L@@ ong , from No@@ s@@ . from Paris to Mo@@ z@@ art the ro@@ ck oper@@ a , most of the attempts would be made in the ridiculous .
And the success stories like Cab@@ ar@@ t or the Mis@@ si@@ ves were the au@@ to for the myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ in in Ch@@ ast@@ el@@ et and St@@ age - En@@ ter@@ t@@ ment in Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or changed the situation .
Today , these two scenes are taking the headlines as a success story .
The first takes up , this Christmas , its excellent M@@ air F@@ air and announ@@ ces for the following the global creation of &quot; an American in Paris &quot; .
In Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or , &quot; La B@@ el@@ le and the Be@@ ast &quot; could be one of the success stories of the season .
On the other scenes , music shows like &quot; 17@@ 89 &quot; , &quot; the Bas@@ til@@ le &apos;s la@@ zy &quot; and the small mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy like &quot; Dis@@ co &quot; or &quot; Life and Times &quot; make sense of success and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , author of the reference book &quot; history of mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy &quot; and conf@@ er on the The@@ at@@ el@@ et The@@ at@@ re , analy@@ zes the reasons for the success that was so badly conqu@@ ered .
How do French mu@@ si@@ cal coun@@ ties develop ?
The offer has multi@@ plied .
First there are the &quot; mu@@ si@@ cal shows &quot; that evolve at the mercy of producers ...
Some use them - beautiful images projec@@ tions and a real story like in 17@@ 89 , the A@@ man@@ ts of the Bas@@ til@@ le .
Others make a leap of fifteen years on the pretext that we can be used roughly - whatever you have Mat@@ t - Po@@ k@@ ora in the head of post@@ er .
Then , we have the mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy with the s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ous produc@@ tions of C@@ ast@@ el@@ let that make us revive the golden age of Bro@@ ad@@ way and discover the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ d@@ he@@ im , the largest - living com@@ pos@@ er .
St@@ age - Sur@@ t@@ t@@ ment popul@@ ari@@ zes the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon music com@@ edy of variety by adapting them in French .
The independent French producers are trying to make a living .
But ongoing projects like &quot; R@@ ent &quot; , &quot; The B@@ ai@@ er of the woman ar@@ ry &quot; or &quot; A@@ ve@@ il of the - spring &quot; have trouble being financed .
Do we have enough artists capable as a sing@@ er of sing@@ er , play and d@@ ance ?
In Paris , when there are eight music shows in a season , it &apos;s a great year .
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects in projects .
In the United States , cra@@ p of the music com@@ edy , it &apos;s very different .
Young people are trained to these professions in many schools .
There are lots of jobs between regional theat@@ res , tourist , Bro@@ ad@@ way , off-@@ -B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way ...
The pi@@ e vi@@ vi@@ de is also so as the number of posts to be filled .
Why does the province in the province have as much success ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor parent of culture in France .
Fe@@ w theat@@ er pieces leave on tour and it &apos;s often a &quot; theat@@ er theat@@ er &quot; for adults and not young adults .
The music shows fill this - lack .
They are the same young people who like tele@@ reality and what it produces like ep@@ hem@@ eral st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful young men ( often tal@@ ented ) at the top of the show of a music show , it &apos;s the insurance of these young girls and often of their entire family .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these shows are sav@@ ing@@ y - held by professionals who answer questions .
These shows are very much expected when they arrive in a province of the province .
The may@@ on@@ na@@ ise has grown in Paris and disgu@@ sted by prov@@ inci@@ als .
The S@@ ho@@ w is designed to enter all major French rooms in the same form as in Paris .
A serious injured in an accident with a gh@@ o@@ st driver on the Brussels Brussels ping
A road accident caused a serious hurt , on Friday morning at 5 : 30 , on the internal moving of Brussels at the he@@ ight of Ho@@ e@@ il@@ art , in the direction of W@@ ater@@ lo@@ o .
The car of a driver was bought by a gh@@ o@@ st driver , who is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
The movement was closed to the traffic , until 9 : 00 , at the place of the accident , the time that the road is taken out and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
However , this situation has hardly caused traffic j@@ ams because the accident took place at the he@@ ight of the H@@ O@@ hil@@ a@@ art exit .
The traffic has therefore been thrown out by this exit / entry .

His vital prog@@ no@@ sis is no longer engaged but he &apos;s still hosp@@ it@@ alized .
At the time of the fall , the gu@@ y was with his father on a ship of the &quot; Pi@@ ats of the Caribbean &quot; .
It was closed up until new order .
DR@@ C : the army is preparing a new assault
Children are playing on a carbon bl@@ un@@ é that belong@@ ed to the M@@ 23 rebels , in K@@ it@@ b@@ umb@@ a on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new attack against the last bas@@ tions of the rebels of M@@ 23 near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The objective is to remove the M@@ 23 of the h@@ ills that over@@ shadow B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Yesterday , we took the h@@ ill of Bu@@ in@@ a , which over@@ shad@@ ows the one of M@@ bu@@ z@@ i .
Today , M@@ bu@@ z@@ i should fall by himself .
There will only be the R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i h@@ ill .
&quot; S@@ el@@ low of Chan@@ s@@ or is not very strategic &quot; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P the Govern@@ or of North Ki@@ v@@ u , Ju@@ li@@ en P@@ lu@@ k@@ u .
Mr P@@ lu@@ k@@ u plans to go on Saturday to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Poli@@ tics and the last place of the re@@ bel@@ lion , this loc@@ ality is located at the Ug@@ and@@ an border , about 80 km away north of G@@ om@@ a .
It was taken on Wednesday by the Ar@@ med For@@ ces of the Democratic Republic of Congo Wednesday .
Since then , a few hundred per@@ missi@@ bles from M@@ 23 are taken up at almost 2@@ ,000 me@@ ters of al@@ titude on the farm h@@ ills of Chan@@ nel , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bu@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and the neighbouring town of J@@ om@@ a
In J@@ om@@ ba , an inhabit@@ ant who reported fighting all near Thursday during the whole day indicated that the situation was &quot; calm since this morning &quot; .
According to him , a woman and her child were killed by the fighting on the day and were buried .
A gir@@ l@@ friend was injured by the ball , and three other people were injured , including a rise , evac@@ uated by the F@@ AR@@ DC , added this witness cited by the A@@ F@@ P .
Since the start of fighting between the F@@ AR@@ DC and the rebels on 25 October , the two war@@ ring parties have not given any assessment of the loss of life .
The N@@ SA &apos;s re@@ vel@@ ations increase the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance
By a nice day of the end of August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter over@@ vol@@ ved at low al@@ titude the British Con@@ cell@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , Germany &apos;s financial capital .
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the National German intelligence agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the American out@@ post , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explain that the B@@ f@@ V was hoping to identify the presence of listening an@@ ten@@ nes and that the operation triggered an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James C@@ l@@ ap@@ er , the director of American intelligence services , insisted again in September that the United States does not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to &quot; ste@@ al industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies for the account of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits &quot; .
But since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the consul@@ tant who has become whis@@ tle@@ b@@ ast@@ er , started un@@ ve@@ iling his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble trea@@ sure of information about the secre@@ ts of US surveillance , European governments and business managers don &apos;t know if you have to believe the director to speak .
Re@@ ports that the National Security American has sp@@ illed Brazilian oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as and had access to data held by American providers of storage services in the C@@ oul@@ d , especially Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have more than ever triggered par@@ ano@@ id par@@ ano@@ ia of companies
The re@@ vel@@ ation according to which German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had been ha@@ c@@ ked , maybe even for a decade , was the drop of water that made the ca@@ ke over@@ flow .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then company managers are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den made the intensive collaboration between American intelligence services and companies transparent .
I think it &apos;s inconceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest .
&quot; Germany must wake up &quot; says O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ ü@@ n , the president of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , who represents German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies think that the United States represents such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm E@@ Y .
However , in all the documents un@@ ve@@ iled by Mr. S@@ now@@ den , there is no evidence to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and internet capabilities and think that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Company managers are skep@@ tical about this .
A deputy from the German parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
&quot; This is not the right way to do &quot; , says H@@ ass@@ o P@@ at@@ at@@ ner , president of the German company software company , SA@@ P .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then we shoul@@ dn &apos;t let it die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , coal to cars , through farmers .
Everything except IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistic@@ ation of US es@@ pion@@ age agencies exposed by the S@@ now@@ den re@@ vel@@ ations were a shock for some companies that thought that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance .
A big change is taking place in the cl@@ oud computer because European leaders realized that the data kept in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to an investigation carried out by the C@@ lou@@ d Security Alliance , a professional organization , some 10 % of non-@@ American members have renoun@@ ced their projects to use an American provider of storage services in the cl@@ oud after the re@@ vel@@ ations about the US program of data expl@@ oration . P@@ ris@@ m .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ be@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &quot; Our clients ask us today a question that they di@@ dn &apos;t ask us a year ago : where my data are kept and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction ? &quot;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most precious secre@@ ts and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It &apos;s not surprising that there is economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There have always been .
&quot; It &apos;s a recur@@ rent topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion &quot; , says Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck , director of the company producer of chemical products B@@ AS@@ F .
The Americans sp@@ y on us in commercial and industrial terms just as we sp@@ y on them , because it is in the national interest to defend our companies .
Company managers are usually unlikely to reveal the prevention measures they put in place , in case it would leave the benefit of an op@@ ponent .
Bi@@ g companies have long been mar@@ ching the message that it is for the least im@@ prudent to recover a free US@@ B key in a professional room or to leave a lap@@ top computer without monitoring in a ho@@ tel room .
U@@ l@@ ich Ha@@ k@@ enberg , a member of the management board of the automobile manufacturer . Au@@ di , says that the collection of mobile phones before the advice of the advice , so that they can &apos;t be used as distance listening devices , is a common practice for years .
Germany &apos;s B@@ f@@ V advis@@ es its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones paid during their tri@@ ps abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of smar@@ t@@ phones .
P@@ re-@@ paid mobile phones are then thrown out .
However , we are worried that small and medium-sized companies will remain vulnerable to pir@@ ating and monitoring .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&quot; SMEs often lack experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access &quot; , warn the B@@ f@@ V in a report .
The United States alert their own companies to the activities of economic es@@ pion@@ age carried out by other countries .
The National Int@@ ellec@@ tu@@ ale E@@ sti@@ m@@ ate ( N@@ I@@ E ) carried out in February by the United States , was quoting France , as well as Russia and Israel , guilty to the second degree of having carried out economic information pir@@ ates , behind China , according to The Washington Po@@ st .
A member of the management board of a re@@ now@@ ned German company thought that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst &quot; .
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ quar@@ c@@ ini , the former director of French in@@ ner intelligence , the D@@ C@@ R@@ I , said in an interview this month : &quot; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , sp@@ it their allies . &quot;
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er of Georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , think their son was killed
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er of Georgia , whose body has been found in a ru@@ ined fight in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ ge of his high school , think that their son was killed , declared the family lawyer Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , from Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on 11 January stuck in a car@@ pet strongly standing behind the stands of the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se of his high school .
The investig@@ ators of the Com@@ é of L@@ ow@@ oun@@ ds concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son was died in unusual circumstances , but the family of the young bo@@ y of 17 con@@ tests these conclusions .
&quot; They &apos;@@ re absolutely certain that their son was killed &quot; , said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ m@@ p , the lawyer representing Ken@@ ne@@ th and J@@ ac@@ qu@@ y@@ y@@ n Joh@@ n@@ son , on F@@ paradox New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff &apos;s conclusions .
&quot; They think that it challenges all logic , physical laws and common sense &quot; , added C@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the or those responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; They sent their son to the school with a table and they made them in a mor@@ tal ba@@ g &quot; , he added .
The US Public Prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore said on Thursday that he was carrying out an official investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , pointing out that several important questions remained un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
Mo@@ ore expressed himself during a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I will follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My goal is to discover the truth .
&quot; I consider that there is a sufficient basis &quot; to open an official investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore told journalists that the first au@@ top@@ sy indicated that Joh@@ n@@ son was dec@@ e@@ ased by &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ y . &quot;
However , a second au@@ top@@ sy has identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&quot; Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation &quot; , he indicated .
Mo@@ ore added that if he reveals elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation on the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , he will ask the F@@ B@@ I to lead it .
The representative of the office of the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of L@@ ow@@ oun@@ ds was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him on Thursday .
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to put all the vide@@ o-@@ surveillance records that the investig@@ ators had examined .
The parents of the teen@@ ag@@ er said they hope that video images contain clu@@ es about the circumstances of his death .
The CD@@ C publ@@ ishes advice on aller@@ gies in the child to schools
Wednesday , the American Centre for Dis@@ ease Prevention and Prevention published a series of directives indicating how to manage the food aller@@ gies of children at school .
This is the first series of guidelines that the American government publ@@ ishes , since the number of children in school age suffering from food aller@@ gies has so@@ ared .
A child in 20 in the United States today suffers from a food all@@ ergy .
The CD@@ C discovered that the pre@@ valence of food aller@@ gies in the child had increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise awareness of prof@@ ess@@ oral bodies and staff to the food aller@@ gies in the child , and how to deal with them in the event of an aller@@ gic reaction .
It also recommends to schools to have a cat@@ ch@@ ment stock - E@@ pi@@ p@@ en brand self-@@ injec@@ tor being the most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially deadly an@@ ap@@ la@@ x@@ is .
The legislative assemb@@ lies of the states have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily the sp@@ ray in stock .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicate by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
Children can say , &quot; I have the impression that something like the language &quot; , &quot; I feel like I have a ha@@ ir on the language &quot; or &quot; I have pedestri@@ ans on the language &quot; .
The N@@ SA affair highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How can you explain the contradictory attitude of the French government , which on the one hand is off@@ ended in public by calling the ambassador of the United States on 21 October , and on the other banning the over@@ flying of the territory by Boli@@ vian presidential plane , based on the rum@@ or of the presence on his board of Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French government .
When Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de calls on Barack Obama or the Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent F@@ abi@@ us calls the ambassador of the United States , they react to a real discovery , which is the scale of the American surveillance on all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the col@@ um@@ ns in Le Mon@@ de a few weeks away from the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspon@@ dence and on the other a condemnation of the listen of the Qu@@ ai d &apos;@@ Or@@ say by the N@@ SA ?
Would it not be like a vague hypocrisy from you ?
The journ@@ alistic process is not a moral posi@@ tioning , but the search of interest and the relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks remove the ve@@ il on the American diplomacy analysis of political or other issues around the world , we do indeed think that , in view of American power , this is an important lighting .
When we describe the American inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it &apos;s under no circumstances to outra@@ ge us of this practice , it &apos;s to describe the world as it &apos;s .
Did France receive information provided by the N@@ SA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration ?
The introduction of very powerful inter@@ c@@ eption technology for the past ten years by the United States , but also by France , has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism .
Also , in this field , France and the United States , in particular , have put in place cooperation and information exchange procedures almost daily and are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal zones in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sha@@ h has been reported to the French thanks to the means of the N@@ SA .
France can be conducted , for example , to trans@@ mit whole blocks of data on the Sa@@ hel region to American services , and in return - we already said it quickly - the Americans can give the French people information on other regions of the world .
So the basic question behind this N@@ SA affair is@@ n &apos;t so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with inter@@ c@@ eption tools , that the question of the total lack of prior debate , especially within the parliaments , about the justification of such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be their own , and ultimately the question of violations of liberties .
What is the real risk of the United States ?
We can denounce them , I don &apos;t see how they can be punished .
The risk run by the Americans may be double .
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes at the top of their state , have been watched .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States were tense .
Another effect may be more econom@@ ical : more and more European or South American companies are struggling , in the light of the re@@ vel@@ ations , to entr@@ ust their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws , and therefore to the em@@ taking of the N@@ SA .
Last element : the vast movement of re@@ vel@@ ations committed by media around the world , which helps to start a debate on intelligence monitoring practices until then almost non-existent , could force legislators , including Americans , to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services .
Pa@@ rents of sex children can choose &quot; un@@ defined sex &quot;
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for inf@@ ants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
The male or female sex of the new born will not be attributed to them in a rigid way at birth .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children , allowing them to include an &quot; un@@ defined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; sex on its birth certificate .
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could take ha@@ sty decisions regarding an sur@@ ger@@ y of sexual re@@ sting for their inf@@ ants , and to fight against discrimination against people who are sexual .
According to the B@@ BC , an sexual person would have said years later , &quot; I am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I &apos;@@ m going to stay the pat@@ ch@@ work that doctors , con@@ tu@@ si@@ ties and bal@@ af@@ és created .
It is estimated that a child on 2 000 born every year is neither a bo@@ y nor a gir@@ l .
They are inter@@ viewed , the inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality is part of the group of 60 diseases diagno@@ sed as a distur@@ b@@ ance of sexual development , a generic term design@@ ating people with ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ os@@ om@@ es or g@@ on@@ ades ( o@@ varies or tes@@ ticul@@ ar ) or ab@@ normally developed sexual organs .
Di@@ ana S@@ imp@@ son could have been sex@@ ually sex@@ tured .
S@@ ex@@ ual identification is still not well understood , but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be defined , it is better to use the best information available to at@@ tribute it , then to wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a sur@@ gical act , where necessary .
D@@ r J@@ ack D@@ res@@ cher , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and speci@@ alizing in questions of sexual identification , said that the new German law &quot; seems to be a good idea &quot; .
S@@ ex@@ ual children pose an ethical dilemma .
&quot; Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a sur@@ gical act , but it &apos;s not the case of most children &quot; , he added .
You can make sexual as@@ sign@@ ment without operation , and see how identity develops .
The science of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
Nobody can answer the question of why this happens .
It &apos;s like the myster@@ y surrounding homosexual people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 describing people who are sex@@ ually abused as different from trans@@ sex@@ ual or trans@@ gender people , since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively that of a man or just that of a woman , but is in general both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other .
These features can be manife@@ sted themselves in secondary sexual character ( like mus@@ li@@ m mass , p@@ ilo@@ ting , pe@@ p@@ per , and stat@@ ure ) , pri@@ mi@@ tive sexual character ( like re@@ producing bodies and sexual bodies ) or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ ro@@ s@@ om@@ es and hormones .
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by sexual and trans@@ gender people in employment matters , as well as the scale of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
Young non-@@ compli@@ ant girls now have camps that are especially destined for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to sign male , femin@@ ine or &quot; third sex &quot; on their official documents .
In June , a 25@@ -@@ year-old Austr@@ ali@@ an , Nor@@ ri@@ e May@@ -@@ W@@ el@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been recognised &quot; neutral &quot; after winning his appeal trial that allows him to keep a &quot; un@@ specified sex &quot; to life .
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F - X for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighb@@ oring France , gender issues are always the subject of controversy , according to a report broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of legislators in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be removed from the school books .
The American website Ca@@ thol@@ ics On@@ line also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; since the world is dra@@ gged in a new rule where the gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one , we &apos;@@ re over@@ turning two other pillars of civilisation . &quot;
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of a baby also said on B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to be awarded to babies at their birth .
&quot; The role of parent is sufficiently stressed without any additional restrictions , especially if you don &apos;t know the sex of your child &quot; , she said on the site for young parents .
Children need stability and certainties .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sexual organs were called Her@@ ma@@ h@@ ro@@ i@@ x , according to the name of the beautiful Greek God who had a double sex .
And only about ten years ago , the medical community considered the gender to be an arm , that you can er@@ ase and on which we can re@@ design it .
But now , many people are questioning the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can make mistakes , don &apos;t knowing how a child will feel his sexual resignation when he grow up .
&quot; In the middle of 20th century , it was called a psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency &quot; , said D@@ res@@ cher .
When these children were born , they di@@ dn &apos;t call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , they were phone calls .
The dominant theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by D@@ r John Mon@@ ey , at the University Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins , who considered that the gender is dead .
He devoted the term &quot; sexual identity &quot; and argued that social and environmental signals - the way parents raise a child - inter@@ act with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female .
But in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as &quot; John / Jo@@ an &quot; , his the@@ ories gave rise to controversy .
He advised the parents of a little bo@@ y whose pen@@ is had been cut during a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to make him completely obs@@ essed , by also removing the tes@@ ticul@@ es , and raising him like a gir@@ l .
&quot; Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transition case , but it was not the case &quot; , said D@@ res@@ cher .
At the age of about 15 , he became a gu@@ y and married with a woman .
But at 38 , he committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ cher said that some doctors &quot; always repeat this model &quot; .
But in the 9@@ 0s , with the arrival of the Internet , those who survived these sex change operations say &quot; &#91; that &#93; they are not satisfied with the result . &quot;
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old writ@@ er from Mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ os@@ es X@@ Y but ambiguous sexual organs .
Do@@ c@@ tors cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t really say if he had a large cli@@ tor@@ is or a little pen@@ is and convinced that he could never have a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
So soon after his birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered a sur@@ gical subscri@@ ption from the external body and the tes@@ ticul@@ es and was high like a gir@@ l .
He was given female hormones at the age of 12 .
&quot; I knew I was not a gir@@ l &quot; , he said on A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he was subjected to a v@@ ag@@ in@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ i .
But de@@ pressed and realized that something di@@ dn &apos;t go , he asked his medical file .
What he discovered was horri@@ fied .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth - and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( D@@ D@@ S ) that prevented its body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one so that its sexual organs could develop .
Having learned the truth , he became a man , following a treatment with te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one and got rid of the brea@@ sts .
The sur@@ ger@@ y made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he defends the cause of others in an organization called Inter@@ face Pro@@ ject , which is trying to norm@@ alize the perception of people who are sexual .
But An@@ ne Th@@ ard@@ -@@ M@@ attr@@ s , the general director of the non-@@ profit organization based in California Ad@@ voc@@ ate for In@@ formed C@@ ho@@ ice , fears that the German law &quot; inv@@ ites labelling and stig@@ ma@@ tisation &quot; .
&quot; Many activists worry that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children an &quot; un@@ defined sex &quot; , she said .
We are afraid it encourages interventions .
We think it would be better to give a male or female sex , and wait .
But we di@@ dn &apos;t see what the law would give , so we can only advance hypo@@ thes@@ es .
Tam@@ ar-@@ M@@ attr@@ s said that his organization supported the Austr@@ ali@@ an law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex &quot; .
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind &quot; , she added .
German law concerns the attribu@@ tion of sex to birth .
It &apos;s not a battle that young children should lead to this age .
When they grow , they will be able to make decisions about their own body .
But the D@@ r Ar@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , a radi@@ olog@@ ist speci@@ alized in the mo@@ mo@@ graph@@ s in Pit@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , whose daughter is afflic@@ ted by a mess of sexual development and which helps thousands of people in a support group , said that the German law &quot; responsibility will be &quot; responsibility &quot; for parents and children .
The gir@@ l of D@@ r Bar@@ at@@ z , K@@ are@@ t , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ os@@ es , but suffers from a D@@ D@@ S called in@@ sensitive syn@@ dro@@ me for an@@ dro@@ me .
As a result of the failure of its anc@@ estors of an@@ dro@@ me , K@@ a@@ is has developed femin@@ ine features .
She has a v@@ ag@@ in , but no u@@ ter@@ us or o@@ varies .
Today , 29 years old , K@@ are@@ t is married and internal in childhood psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania University .
Although it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or port@@ able mothers .
&quot; The law gives parents some la@@ titude so that they don &apos;t have to make ha@@ sty decisions &quot; , said Bar@@ at@@ z .
This leaves them the time to do some tests and to understand them , and a deadline before putting &quot; male &quot; or &quot; femin@@ ine &quot; .
So everything goes well - you can raise your child and love it .
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parent .
You do not have to rush you for sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
&quot; This puts children at the heart of the decision and moder@@ ates the feeling of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they are sc@@ ared of not doing what you need &quot; , she said .
Finally , the child will decide with which sex he / she feels the / most at ease - and it &apos;s something wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .
T@@ et@@ ta confident in the long@@ ev@@ ity of his government
The Italian Council president En@@ ric@@ o L@@ et@@ ta judges that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to stri@@ p Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi of his mandate .
In an interview daily La Sta@@ mp@@ a , the leader of the center left says he has &quot; firmly the intention &quot; to continue to govern with his coalition until the next general elections in 2015 .
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet during the month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted for tax evasion in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi threatens to remove his support for the government if the Senate , where he has more opponents than supporters , pronoun@@ ces his de@@ portation .
But part of his camp , grou@@ ped around the National Secretary of the People &apos;s Pe@@ op@@ les ( P@@ D@@ L ) Ang@@ el@@ ino Al@@ fan@@ o , continues to support the government , as demonstrated on 2 October last year his refusal to give in to Berlusconi &apos;s orders that already wanted to let the cabinet fall .
The L@@ .@@ A@@ . Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Security Agency , T@@ SA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire .
fire@@ men called on the scene of the drama claimed that they responded to an appeal showing &quot; multiple w@@ ounded &quot; .
&quot; The forces of order are there &quot; , specifies the airport on its T@@ wit@@ ter account , while TV pictures showed people evac@@ uated in am@@ bul@@ ances .
&quot; There was a sho@@ oting , &quot; said to the A@@ F@@ P a spokes@@ person for the American transport security agency ( T@@ SA ) .
The local an@@ ten@@ na of A@@ BC showed a person evac@@ uated on a k@@ ic@@ king , and a second transported on a whe@@ el@@ chair .
The incident took place at 9 : 30 p.m. ( 12@@ r@@ m in Mon@@ tre@@ al ) at the ter@@ minal 3 of the airport , also specified the airport .
The L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Times specifies that the T@@ em@@ in@@ als 2 and 3 are being evac@@ uated .
The T@@ SA spokesman was not able to confirm immediately if one of his employees was injured .
All flights at the arrival and departure of the airport have been suspended .
The Israeli army k@@ ills a member of Hamas to Gaz@@ a
Israeli tanks killed an Islamist Palestinian milit@@ ant in Hamas on Thursday and injured another in the south of the Gaza stri@@ p , they learned after sources of health services .
A source from Hamas has explained that fighting has broken out in this region , because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian property fir@@ ing .
The Israeli army has content itself with mentioning a &quot; targeted action &quot; in the area close to a tunnel called &quot; terrorist &quot; by the State He@@ bre@@ u , dig@@ ging at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-@@ October .
Report : Obama campaign considered to be leaving B@@ id@@ en for H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton
The advis@@ ors closest to President Barack Obama have considered , in the biggest secret , to replace V@@ ice President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en by H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most striking event that appears in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign of Mar@@ k H@@ all@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ n , &quot; D@@ on D@@ own@@ n : G@@ ame Change 2012 &quot; .
The Times got a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday night that the president &apos;s close collabor@@ ators had conducted &quot; thorough work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 &quot; to see if the ev@@ ic@@ tion of B@@ id@@ en could help Obama in his re-@@ election while his hopes were d@@ run@@ k .
According to the political correspon@@ dent of the Times J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior leaders of the campaign and of the White House , namely the former Secretary General of the White House . Bill D@@ é@@ al@@ y , to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the ballot .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that was fier@@ cely guar@@ ded within the B@@ G of the Chic@@ ago campaign and inside the o@@ ven Office .
Only half a dozen close advis@@ ors of the president - especially D@@ é@@ e@@ y , the former campaign leader of Obama J@@ im M@@ ess@@ ina and the former advisers in the White House David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ id and David P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e - knew that the change was at the study .
&quot; D@@ on D@@ own@@ n &quot; indicates that D@@ e@@ ey has conducted the charge to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their &quot; close personal links &quot; , before finally deciding against change when the numbers have shown that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot; did not significantly improve Obama &apos;s chances of success &quot; .
In an interview with Martin , D@@ e@@ ey confirmed that the administration did indeed plan to replace B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
&quot; I said I had looked at a whole series of questions , and it was one of them , &quot; said D@@ é@@ e@@ y in the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that at the time , the president was not in shape , and so we said , &quot; Lord , what can we do ? &quot;
While Dam@@ é@@ y called the &quot; concer@@ t &quot; examination , Martin said to Ander@@ son Co@@ op@@ er of C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested a lot to discover if the change would be beneficial during the elections .
&quot; The countryside doesn &apos;t spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking measures &quot; , said Martin on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
However , we do not know if Obama was aware that his team was looking at the replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N that he asked D@@ é@@ le@@ y if his bos@@ s was aware of the possible re@@ organisation .
Even though D@@ é@@ e@@ y said he did not think the president was aware of the possible change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was &quot; possible &quot; that Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; D@@ on D@@ own@@ n &quot; did not definitively answer the question of whether political surveys had arrived on the Obama office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama di@@ dn &apos;t know that B@@ id@@ en &apos;s ev@@ ic@@ tion of the presidential list was considered .
&quot; Maybe &quot; replied Martin .
Do you want a flu@@ o ice ?
A British entreprene@@ ur created the first flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent ice in the world based on me@@ ats .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has taken advantage of the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of this marine animal to develop a lu@@ sty col@@ lation .
He had the idea after reading a study on the me@@ ats and convinced Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate the sh@@ it protein chem@@ ically .
The ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the language by increasing the p@@ H of the protein to make it sh@@ it .
Ch@@ ris explains that , since the ice cre@@ am starts to sh@@ it when it responds to the heat of the mouth , the more we go , the more it becomes brilliant .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the ice society &quot; L@@ ick M@@ e . &quot; I &apos;@@ m De@@ li@@ id , said : &quot; It &apos;s something incredible but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 £ . &quot;
The protein we use in the ice re@@ acts with the neutral p@@ H language .
So when your mouth heat up the protein , the level of p@@ H increases and the ice is sh@@ ining .
We tried it over the last few months and it seemed good to share it with everyone at the time of H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
It &apos;s probably the most expensive ice I created because the f@@ uc@@ king of the weather is worth four times more expensive than gold .
Every shop costs me about £ 140 .
But it &apos;s pretty good !
society at the experimental process of Char@@ lie , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual ic@@ ing fra@@ gr@@ ances such as beer , che@@ ese , beef and the golden lea@@ f .
But his next creation will be even more ambitious .
He added : &quot; I really want to develop an in@@ visible ice . &quot;
It is intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the reaction caused by ic@@ ing cryst@@ als that are the ice cre@@ am , but I think I &apos;@@ ll find a way to do it .
The ice uses the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent properties of the gu@@ y synthetic by Chinese scientists .

H@@ all@@ we@@ n 2013 : In numbers
When I was small , H@@ all@@ we@@ en was magic .
My s@@ ister and I were allowed to eat swee@@ ts , to go down late and to disgu@@ ise ourselves to go in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
Today , I became more p@@ is@@ sed .
Over the last two years , I have not distributed a single bon@@ us and I will certainly not do it this year .
But the st@@ ats show that I am the black sheep when we talk about H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
The majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will celebrate H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en this year , spending a total of 6.@@ 9 million euros on bon@@ good , disgu@@ sting and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to National R@@ et@@ ter@@ ation .
What I &apos;@@ m looking forward to every party in H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en is the tendencies .
The disgu@@ sting should represent $ 1.2 million on the 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , in@@ anim@@ ated objects make fu@@ n .
Women no longer need to be sex@@ y professionals ; they can also be sex@@ y food like p@@ iz@@ z@@ as , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As for men , I expect to see many z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , thanks to the TV series The Wall De@@ ad , and I be@@ t that the men from the space of D@@ a@@ of@@ t P@@ un@@ k will be among our photo@@ s In@@ stag@@ ra@@ m this year .
According to Google , the most sought disgu@@ sts are z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I suppose that there is no problem remaining traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my surprise , they were not the only ones .
In fact , Americans will spend $ 3@@ 30 M in disgu@@ sting for animals this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This is a lot of curious dogs disgu@@ ised as H@@ ot@@ dog@@ s .
When it &apos;s good good , we don &apos;t sli@@ p .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 $ in good this year , according to the Ni@@ el@@ sen cabinet .
This represents about 27@@ 2 million k@@ g of b@@ alls Her@@ sh@@ ey , sug@@ ars , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ l@@ ers and b@@ ars C@@ lar@@ k .
It &apos;s a great news for the 41 million children who go to the hun@@ t hun@@ t in their neigh@@ bor@@ hood , according to the American department of the Comm@@ er@@ ce .
In fact , we &apos;@@ re going to buy and , let &apos;s tell ourselves no stories , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate during H@@ all@@ e@@ we@@ en .
The bon@@ good cor@@ n is the only thing we do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million k@@ g are sold for H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en , according to the National Con@@ f-@@ Association Association .
This represents about 9 billion grain grain grain .
It &apos;s a myster@@ y that I have not yet managed to el@@ der .
Nothing is more representative of H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en than H@@ an@@ ed houses .
They have the best names , like &quot; Te@@ ro@@ r Be@@ h@@ in@@ d The W@@ alls &quot; ( which is actually a real prison ) , &quot; H@@ ow@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ S@@ c@@ ren@@ am &quot; and &quot; The H@@ ou@@ se of She@@ ck &quot; .
Ac@@ tually , there are 1@@ ,@@ 200 officially recognised houses in the United States , which generate about $ 500 of revenue , according to America .
Finally , let &apos;s talk about c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls .
Char@@ lie Brown presented us La Bi@@ ous@@ se Ci@@ ro@@ ille when we were g@@ on@@ na , and sp@@ itting a sh@@ it@@ ty sh@@ it , it &apos;s like dec@@ or@@ ating a Christmas tre@@ e - it &apos;s something we &apos;@@ ve done since we &apos;@@ re all small .
Luc@@ k@@ ily for us , the &quot; B@@ é@@ b@@ é@@ sh@@ é trend &quot; started only last year thanks to P@@ inter@@ est , so most of us s@@ cul@@ ed these po@@ les and di@@ dn &apos;t have to sit down in it .
This year , Americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 M in c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls , according to the U@@ .@@ S@@ . C@@ en@@ sus Bureau .
The sh@@ it@@ ty lan@@ es that are slowly f@@ uc@@ king on your house &apos;s por@@ k probably came from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 5@@ 42 million c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls were grown this year .
If you &apos;@@ re trying to make you notice more , call Ti@@ m and S@@ us@@ an Ma@@ the@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , California , and try to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ate their sh@@ it of 9@@ 22 k@@ g .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scot@@ land will internally create a de@@ vice structure ( &quot; bad bank &quot; ) involving 38 billion p@@ ounds ( 45 billion euros ) of the most risky assets , measure to rela@@ x relations with London and speed up its re@@ privatization .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet by 55 % to 70 % in the next two years and hope to have completely clean@@ ed up it in three years .
R@@ B@@ S also said that it would include a vision to depreci@@ ate the additional dubious debts of four to 4@@ .5 billion books in the quarter , a writing related to the constitution of the can@@ ning structure .
R@@ B@@ S also said that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion p@@ ounds of capital , thereby strengthening its ability to lend .
The bank and London stressed that the &quot; bad bank &quot; would make it possible to draw a line on the past , the government having in particular been accused of interfering in the management of R@@ B@@ S .
&quot; We can now move forward , worry about the future and 90 % of the assets that represent a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the UK &quot; , said the new Director-General Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan to the press .

D@@ re@@ w Bo@@ ler , the director General of Bo@@ ler M@@ ot@@ or@@ port said : &quot; The r@@ all@@ y@@ re am@@ ate@@ ur am@@ ate@@ urs who join . B@@ ler have changed . &quot;
They are not all experienced , some are looking for exc@@ itation and ad@@ venture and realistic access to international events .
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with L@@ and R@@ over and the M@@ SA , and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of ra@@ ys in the United Kingdom and international , and to prepare for the ri@@ gg@@ ers and the realities of ra@@ ids ra@@ id .

Moreover , the D@@ ef@@ der Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deser@@ ts of North Africa and the Middle East .
The fire@@ men have been called to rescue a lost p@@ lot after staying stuck at 15 I above the ground on an unstable cor@@ n@@ ic in a career
Ru@@ by , a co@@ ol spon@@ ge , had escap@@ ed after a road accident without gravity
She was re@@ tri@@ ved three days later by a person who wal@@ ked his dog stuck in the career .
The fire@@ men des@@ cen@@ ded back to remind you along the c@@ lif@@ f to recover the chic@@ ken and save it from a certain death
A p@@ lot had the chance to escape the worst after the fire@@ men were called to recover it safely even though it was lost at 15 I above the ground on the unstable season of a c@@ lif@@ f .
Ru@@ by , a co@@ ol ke@@ y@@ board of 9 months , escap@@ ed after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday .
His land@@ l@@ ords , Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years old , and his little friend Bec@@ ky H@@ all , 20 years old , went to the career of F@@ ap@@ p@@ res@@ py in Den@@ h@@ ol@@ me , in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to find Ru@@ by and to thank the W@@ est Y@@ or@@ k@@ sh@@ ire fire and rescue service .
They desperately looked for their lost chic@@ ken and launched an appeal on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity .
T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ h@@ 15 Wednesday , a person in the acute eye who promised his dog to re@@ p@@ é Ru@@ by on a cor@@ n@@ ac@@ he in the career , stuck at 15 m above the ground .
A technical assistance team from the fire bri@@ g@@ ade at C@@ l@@ ec@@ ke@@ at@@ on went to the place and came back to a reminder to save Ru@@ by using a ci@@ vic@@ s for animals to transport it until the top of the c@@ lif@@ f .
The technical assistance specialist An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton said : &quot; It was in a precarious situation . &quot;
She was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , 15 me at the top and 15 on the ground .
She absolutely di@@ dn &apos;t move during the rescue - she was frozen .
But it &apos;s fine now .
She e@@ aten b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
It was a very unusual call .
It &apos;s incredible that someone noticed the dog .
The technical assistance specialist Peter L@@ au said : &quot; Ru@@ by had a lot of luck to get out of it . &quot;
She could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was led by the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for control ; its general state was satisfactory , apart from exha@@ u@@ sting and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
M@@ iss H@@ all , of H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : &quot; I was terri@@ fied by watching the help . &quot;
I di@@ dn &apos;t think it was there first .
It was surprising to have it again in arms .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian said that if she had been too exhausted and had ev@@ aded , she would probably have fallen .
The fire@@ men were stun@@ ned .

Beijing calls into question a tur@@ king Islamic movement
&quot; Support behind the scenes for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ an based in Central and Western Asia &quot; , declared the bos@@ s of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong TV channel , according to a video online online on a website on a website .
M@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , who is a member of the political office of the Chinese Communist Party ( PC@@ C ) , was speaking in T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent during an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time a Chinese official design@@ ates a particular organization after Monday &apos;s attack .
According to the Chinese police , three U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs of the same family of the Muslim dominant region of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , the border of several countries of Central Asia , preci@@ pit@@ ated their car with g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine be@@ ds against the entry of the city banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that killed two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and his mother died in the car fire .
The E@@ ti@@ m , which dec@@ la@@ res to fight for the independence of eastern Tur@@ ke@@ an , the former name of the Chinese X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , was cl@@ assed by the UN in 2002 as one of the aff@@ ili@@ ated Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ai@@ da organisations .
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic problems in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George Ker@@ ev@@ an : The break@@ -up of Europe gives the Scottish choice
Another day , another worrying story of independence .
This time , we &apos;@@ ll be warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement to be able to join the EU .
And now we hear stories of passport control in Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wi@@ re border along the wall of H@@ ad@@ nothing .
If it &apos;s true that the St@@ ath@@ cla@@ de newspaper has indicated the possible economic fall@@ out of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it did not appear in the headlines ( and it was planned ) .
No one has said that EU Member States spend a lot of their time circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the moment , a continuous lack of respect for the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from S@@ co@@ ts .
So it &apos;s a story that is not one .
And a story that is so old that it is now fixed : I &apos;@@ ve heard for the first time the b@@ ob@@ ard that &quot; independence means the control of passports &quot; more than 40 years ago .
However , we for@@ got an interesting point in this interpretation of an old d@@ ust gu@@ y .
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe , actually ?
Why exchange the y@@ o@@ ke of London against that of Brussels , especially now ?
Here is the real news about Europe : the grand post@@ war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is definitely at a dead point .
With the euro crisis , the Europe Pro@@ ject is officially dead .
Ac@@ ross Europe , parties that oppose the EU or are fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Al@@ ter@@ na@@ ve party for Germany , founded only this year and arrived by nowhere , brought together almost five million votes in the September federal elections and the Free Democratic Party ( the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the B@@ un@@ des@@ ta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , associated with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket on national economies through joining the single currency , has led many people to think that the European Pro@@ ject has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with the national governments that have excessive budget deficits - it was only true for Greece .
Instead , the European system has placed its members of the exchange rates fav@@ orable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep .
Without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the national currency , the southern European countries end up with an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany .
The only resort is to make cuts in salaries and public spending - encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper un@@ ease related to productivity in Europe .
Following the &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason to subsidi@@ ze French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States .
This is a draw@@ back draw@@ back in terms of costs , as we have already seen in Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ ut .
All wage wages in the world will not prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being pen@@ alized by cheap American sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ up revol@@ t , especially in France , one of the leading EU leaders .
After the war , the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy to ruin itself .
Re@@ sul@@ t : Mar@@ ine Le Pen &apos;s far-@@ right party , the National Anti-@@ European Front , has just won a crucial partial election , referring the socialists to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party to remind him that he cannot assume that a division from the right will automatically encourage the left .
What does Mar@@ ine Le Pen do with her new popularity with the French white class ?
She wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-@@ currency and anti-@@ European bloc in the European Parliament .
If anti-@@ European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That &apos;s what I think : very soon , anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will come back to something that will resemb@@ le the &quot; Europe of the Nations ( sovereign ) &quot; privileged by General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency .
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project , and I hope it will make a swe@@ et eyes in the United States .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of the little England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending Berlin and Brussels .
I think that Scotland could live with a more free European agreement provided we keep our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe .
Otherwise , we should im@@ it@@ ate Norway and maintain our economic independence .
The S@@ N@@ P government of Scotland is – and it should be noted – the anti-@@ austerity political movement that has done the best in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by the Lab@@ or of the Labour Party , Al@@ is@@ ta@@ r Dar@@ ling , and the conservative / Liberal Democrats that followed .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
E@@ arly birth@@ day : Ge@@ tting earlier .
Stu@@ dies show that Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than white girls .
The physical changes do not mean that pub@@ er@@ t@@ é is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts think that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger of early pub@@ er@@ t@@ é
The trend toward an early pub@@ er@@ ty is not so pronounced among boys
The former correspon@@ dent of C@@ N@@ N P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journalist speci@@ alized in family and health issues at the child .
Does a mother have to worry if the brea@@ sts and p@@ acks of her daughter are starting to grow at 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ics held this week in Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , D@@ r Paul K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist , explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard .
&quot; I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - in general , it doesn &apos;t indicate a quick evolution toward full pub@@ er@@ ty , &quot; said K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
The obvious signs of development , such as the bour@@ geo@@ isation of brea@@ sts , the po@@ les under arms and in the chil@@ dish zone and bo@@ di@@ ly sm@@ ell@@ s , appear before girls .
But there was only a small step forward in the age of the first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years old , when it was 12 years old in 1970 .
&quot; Once the po@@ p has started to develop , you need at least two or three years before the first rules appear &quot; , said K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of &quot; Ed@@ ly P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ ls : The Es@@ s@@ ren@@ al Gu@@ ide to C@@ ome with Th@@ is Community Pro@@ ble@@ m &quot; .
The time is the most accurate test to know how the pub@@ er@@ t@@ é will develop .
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; early &quot; when the development of the pe@@ p@@ per is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows down or stops - it &apos;s something that a pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can follow closely .
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist to remove serious problems like tu@@ m@@ ors or k@@ y@@ sts .
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : premature ageing of the ones that can stif@@ le growth and a small size of the adult age .
recommendations for medic@@ ally and hormon@@ al treatment are based on the age of the child , the development rate , the growth rate and emotional maturity .
P@@ sy@@ cho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z is careful with medic@@ ation but recognizes that &quot; controlling pub@@ er@@ t@@ é can reduce certain problems of behavior and the feeling of young girls to be different from others &quot; .
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young girls to have their rules .
&quot; They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they &apos;@@ re going to manage hygiene issues &quot; , said K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
&quot; It was a shock , &quot; remember a woman whose gir@@ l had her first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , it was not prepared emo@@ tionally .
She came back from the frigh@@ tened and shocked school to be the first among her friends .
There are many the@@ ories made to public knowledge about the causes of the early pub@@ er@@ ty .
Yet there is no coherent theory according to which hormones in milk or other food , chemical products in the environment or the sexual messages delivered by the media are responsible .
The boys , like girls , reach their pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z claims that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He participated in a study carried out on girls aged 6 to 9 years old linking the percentage of fat fat to the outbreak of pub@@ er@@ ty .
Other disco@@ veries support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In this country , Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
On a global scale , the early pub@@ er@@ t@@ é mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything , economic conditions for climate , passing through the genes .
Another problem : Although the gu@@ ys have friends on the face and in the younger pu@@ ri@@ an zone , the trend toward a real early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced as among girls .
Other doctors participating in the A@@ A@@ P conference insisted on the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ac@@ é and the fu@@ n p@@ acks is common , even for inf@@ ants and small ones .
&quot; We have to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of pub@@ er@@ t@@ é , &quot; said D@@ r L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist working at the hospital for children Gor@@ y@@ e@@ b in Mor@@ ris@@ on , in the New Je@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents shoul@@ dn &apos;t hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ s to know how to speak with their children .
&quot; This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than planned &quot; , explained K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
If you stay calm , your child will react well in general .
The girls whose pub@@ er@@ t@@ é is early must be reassured that , even when it happens earlier than expected , the process is part of life .

If L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ opinion di@@ dn &apos;t exist , the two cra@@ zy music f@@ ans built their story on real person@@ alities at the time like the mad mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an D@@ a@@ ve V@@ on R@@ on@@ k .
The idea was to show the time leading up to the arrival of Gre@@ en@@ w@@ ich village , this New York neigh@@ bor@@ hood called to become &quot; the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the development of cra@@ zy music that would create international st@@ ars &quot; as the journalist E@@ li@@ j@@ ah Wal@@ id , friend of Van R@@ on@@ k , wrote .
The mo@@ vi@@ e then takes pieces of docu@@ mentary , the d@@ ust music label inv@@ aded 3@@ 3@@ T invented hab@@ ited hab@@ ited by an old un@@ pay@@ able secre@@ tary , the music choices of the time and the c@@ af@@ és where the sing@@ ers were producing .

For Just Ty@@ ber@@ la@@ ke , if the work is necessary to &quot; be considered as good &quot; , &quot; random can also launch someone &apos;s career &quot; and &quot; more and more today &quot; .
Like L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ opinion who refuses to compromise on his music , the po@@ p star explains that in a career , &quot; the most important thing is not to let ourselves be stuck by anything that can prevent us from speaking &quot; .
G@@ ér@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , the author of &quot; SA@@ S &quot; , is dead .
He will never have known the word retirement .
Ph@@ om@@ è@@ ne of the French edi@@ tion , Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , died on Thursday at 83 , had just published his 200@@ th SA@@ S , &quot; The Kremlin &apos;s V@@ end@@ ance &quot; .
In February , the New York Times devoted it as &quot; the sp@@ ying author of sp@@ ying who knew too much &quot; .
He had just spent 10 days in Afghanistan , the theat@@ re of 19@@ 8 and 1994 op@@ us of the famous series of sp@@ ying ro@@ ds .
D@@ physically physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010 , he was moving during this trip with a de@@ am@@ bul@@ ator .
And before Afghanistan , he was also in Libya , Russia , Lebanon , and Mal@@ i .
With four SA@@ S published per year , Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , born on 8 December 19@@ 29 in Paris , made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 19@@ 65 and the publication of &quot; SA@@ S in Istanbul &quot; , the first of the series , almost half a century ago .
&quot; No doubt between 120 and 150 million every country confused &quot; , he was making progress last March .

&quot; I never had the claim to be a liter@@ ary author &quot; , explained G@@ ér@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers .
I consider myself a con@@ spir@@ ator who writ@@ es to dis@@ tract people to whom I don &apos;t send a message .
He worked &quot; like the major pre-@@ war re@@ porters , like Al@@ bert London , who was going there and came back with real and long surveys &quot; .

&quot; I &apos;@@ m constantly my files ( Afghanistan , Syria , ... ) before leaving &quot; , added Ger@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers .
On the spot , I meet journalists , including those of the A@@ F@@ P , diplomats , people of the services I know for some for twenty or thirty years .
As a result , many of its SA@@ S are often pre@@ judicial : so , a month before the attack of a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several senior officials , he had told the story in &quot; Le Ch@@ em@@ in of Dam@@ as@@ cus &quot; .
In &quot; The B@@ eng@@ haz@@ i F@@ ons &quot; , he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city , the cra@@ p of the Libyan revol@@ t .
In 1980 , he was putting the murder of Egyptian President An@@ war E@@ l-@@ S@@ ad@@ at into play in &quot; The p@@ lot of Cairo &quot; , a year before the attack .
In October 2012 , in &quot; Pan@@ ic in B@@ ama@@ ko &quot; , he reported the col@@ um@@ ns of 4@@ X@@ 4 of ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts based on the M@@ ali@@ an capital .

The avi@@ ators qu@@ arre@@ l about the wid@@ th of seats while big orders are at stake .
The dispute is ra@@ ging between the big aviation manufacturers about the wid@@ th of the seats of the tourist class on long-@@ distance flights , opening the way to a bitter confrontation during the Ta@@ b@@ ay &apos;s a@@ ero@@ space room , which is taking place in month .
The conflict is about the wid@@ th of seats proposed on long-@@ distance flights to the passengers of the economic class - who are not always the most cour@@ ted by the airlines , but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the last aircraft presented by Air@@ bus SA@@ S and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week , Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a sie@@ ge size of at least 18 chic@@ ken ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but its big American rival Bo@@ eing says that it should be up to the airlines to decide .
The dispute broke while the avi@@ on@@ ers are trying to sell even bigger versions of their long-@@ running long-@@ run aircraft , hoping maybe a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November .
The way in which seats will be ready at the back of the plane - in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats head front - is essential for the economic output of the &quot; mini-@@ ju@@ m@@ m@@ o &quot; seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says that its re@@ arranged &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X &quot; will be able to welcome in economic class 40@@ 6 people in seats of more than 17 h@@ ens of large , and will be confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 seats per row .
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A@@ 350 will be transport in economic class 350 people in seats of 18 h@@ ens of large confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations in line with 9 .
The a@@ ero@@ space gi@@ ants often exchange pun@@ ches on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus calls directly to the public before the Ta@@ b@@ ay &apos;s aviation room , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financial of a pho@@ to showing three people against each other in the restaur@@ ant , entitled &quot; Do you accept that ? &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ eing offers long-@@ distance flights to smaller seats than in the regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ of@@ s &quot; , indicated John Le@@ ha@@ y , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people grow , but the seats in aircraft have not changed drastically .
Between the beginning of the 1970 &apos;s , when the j@@ am@@ bo 7@@ 47 of Bo@@ eing defined the modern long-@@ mail trip , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American of 40 to 49 years ago increased by 10 % , according to data from the American department of Health .
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 chic@@ ken , according to US health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival c@@ lic@@ ks on a concept of sie@@ ge that dates back to the 195@@ 0s , when the new@@ ly-@@ called &quot; j@@ et &quot; de@@ vice was closer .
Airbus adds that she ordered a study that indicates that an additional chic@@ ken in the wid@@ th of seats would improve the quality of the sle@@ ep of 53 % .
Bo@@ eing con@@ tests Airbus &apos;s figures regarding the wid@@ th of seats and says that it &apos;s not the manufacturers who decide how the airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment .
He also says that the study shows that the cab@@ in experience does not only depend on the wid@@ th of seats .
&quot; It &apos;s really a matter of providing flexibility to the airlines and allowing them to do what they think must be done to carry out their activities &quot; , said K@@ ent C@@ ru@@ er , in charge of passenger satisfaction at Bo@@ eing .
They don &apos;t want us to tell them what will allow them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more about having a certain freedom of movement , but for the providers , it &apos;s more and more a question that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 at the price of the market in the coming decades , enough to have the balance of American and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters said for the first time in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what fe@@ eds the battle between the last devices .
Air@@ bus and Bo@@ eing both claim to have a return per seat in their latest models of long-@@ distance co@@ at@@ -@@ mail models 20 % higher than that of the market leader in this seg@@ ment , the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ R of 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing depends partly on the comparison between the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 per row seats and a model 7@@ 77 of confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated origin in row of 9 .
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated de@@ vice with 10 seats per row currently in service .
&quot; Bo@@ eing is doing this to be able to fill more seats and make its planes more competitive compared to our products &quot; , said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , director of Con@@ for@@ t P@@ ass@@ er at the European Air@@ port . Airbus .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say that the boo@@ k@@ keeping boo@@ ths with 10 seats per row in the 7@@ 77 existing suggest that many passengers argue in favor of a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates .
&quot; A seat wid@@ th of 18 chic@@ ken would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , Airbus &apos;s proposal is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 . &quot; said the domestic expert of cab@@ ins Mari@@ e Kir@@ by , fun@@ eral and ed@@ itor of R@@ un@@ way G@@ ir@@ l Network .
Air@@ buses and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers , including the airlines .
Air@@ plane sel@@ lers who do the tour of the world even win with them a me@@ ter to verify competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While selling itself to offer comfortable devices , all manufacturers also offer planes with den@@ sely den@@ sity confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations to low-cost airlines and for regional tri@@ ps .
Airbus offers an A@@ 350 confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not sold it yet .
Until recently , Airbus emphasized the need for a greater character of the cab@@ ins by offering larger seats in the middle side to some of its aircraft .
Without the support of the other big manufacturer of big modern aircraft , the experts say it &apos;s unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for the seats will lead , but that it could make the sales wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X forget .
The shareholders of Ol@@ c@@ le irrit@@ ated by the salary of El@@ l@@ reason
A majority of the shareholders in Ol@@ c@@ le voted on Thursday against the proposed remuneration for the foun@@ der and director General Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , given the financial performance of his group .
The vote is not binding but comes to sh@@ it out the image of L@@ ar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , the third global fortune just au@@ re@@ ol@@ ed by the victory of his boat at the American Cup .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire still holds 25 % of the capital of the software group he co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
Last year , El@@ l@@ ison had a negative vote on his remuneration .
The bos@@ s has given up on a bon@@ us of 1.2 million dollars for the financial year 2013 .
His fixed salary is only a token dollar .
On the whole of the year period out of 2013 , the net benefit of O@@ r@@ é@@ c@@ le has increased by 3@@ .5 % while the bon@@ us stock market of 27@@ .5 % , over@@ performance the S &amp; P 500 index that took 24 % at the same time .
The new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
A single do@@ se of the vaccine was able to protect the m@@ ouse from dependence on nic@@ ot@@ ine .
Other tests are necessary before starting the tests on the human being , but Professor R@@ on@@ ald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of We@@ ill Cor@@ n@@ ell Me@@ di@@ cal College of New York said that the first signs were encouraging .
&quot; We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exha@@ u@@ sting all the methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches &quot; , said Professor Cor@@ n@@ ell .
The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been modified to trans@@ mit the genetic information necessary to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus selec@@ tively infected the li@@ ver cells , which begins to produce a regular flow of anti@@ bodies .
Anti-@@ bodies trade all the nic@@ ot@@ ine m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules present in the blood system and neutr@@ alize them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having his do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
During the tests , the vacc@@ inated m@@ ouse to whom we then gave nic@@ ot@@ ine continued their activity normally .
But m@@ ouse m@@ ouse who had not been vacc@@ inated &quot; were aw@@ es@@ ome &quot; , said the researchers , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their brain .
The experiences are described in the Science Trans@@ Latin Me@@ di@@ ine jour@@ nal .
Pre@@ vious vaccines against tobacco turned out to be ineffective because they contained anti@@ bodies .
The injec@@ tions had to be repeated so frequently so that anti@@ bodies levels remain high that they were too expensive and poorly practices .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it trans@@ forms the li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe , we could manage it to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nic@@ ot@@ ine .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
&quot; They will know that if they start smoking , they will not be happy because of the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and this can help them to lose their bad habit &quot; , he added .
British scientists have said that the results were interesting but pointed out that much deeper research was necessary .
The Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a dr@@ one
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south , was killed in an American dr@@ one strike on Friday in Pakistan , was taught to the security services .
The death of H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south has been announced several times already in the past .
But the intelligence officials , the army as well as the activis@@ t movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in this strike , conducted in the North W@@ az@@ ir@@ it@@ an region .
&quot; We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south was killed in a dr@@ one shot &quot; , said a senior security officer .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister N@@ aw@@ a@@ z Shar@@ if , moving to London , informed the British Government that discussions had been launched with the Te@@ h@@ ri@@ k e Tal@@ ban Pakistan ( T@@ T@@ P ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by O@@ be@@ id
The former Labour Minister of New Wales in the South Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-@@ corruption regulator .
Former Minister of New Wales of the South Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di denied having changed the trade b@@ ow@@ l policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three goods in the area controlled by the government .
Friday , the Independent Commission Against Cor@@ ruption ( IC@@ CA@@ C ) has broad@@ ened its investigation to find out if Mr. O@@ be@@ id had pres@@ sured several ministers of the State to renew his b@@ alls in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar .
She is now investigating the claims that Mr Tri@@ po@@ di was aware of Mr O@@ be@@ id &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of the former deputy secre@@ tary of Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ po@@ le , Thursday .
During the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government pressed for the b@@ alls to be subject to ten@@ ders .
The ten@@ ants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , b@@ alls about C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar &apos;s companies , which related to the O@@ be@@ id about 2.5 M per year , have been renewed without there being any call for tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was Minister of Por@@ ts from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favor of inv@@ itations to tender .
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. O@@ be@@ id , who recognised Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , called for a change in government policy .
The trans@@ cri@@ pt of telephone convers@@ ations presented to the IC@@ C showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who arrived at the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of M O@@ be@@ id at the Ministry of P@@ ops .
&quot; The subject debated during these telephone convers@@ ations was the development of the policy relating to trade . &quot; asked the deputy commissioner An@@ th@@ ony W@@ he@@ al@@ y to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; No &quot; replied to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
I don &apos;t remember what we were talking about but in any case it was not that .
In any case , certainly not between me and Mr. O@@ be@@ id .
Israeli war@@ planes targeting Syria
Israeli war@@ planes reached a target in the Syrian ports city of La@@ ta@@ k@@ ia Thursday evening , confirms a military officer at Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said that there was at least one .
As@@ ci@@ pi@@ ed Pres@@ is reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 .
At least twice this year , Israel conducted air strikes against missile car@@ goes in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa may have to pass a &quot; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity test &quot;
The government is currently studying the possibility of introducing a &quot; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity test &quot; for foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa while considering extending the repression measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 4@@ 57 visas being used to occupy un@@ skilled positions or as a hi@@ j@@ acked way to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A working document from the government was un@@ ve@@ iled today while the Labour deputy Ma@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w denounced the government dis@@ course on foreign workers , saying that it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbors .
&quot; The f@@ uc@@ king statements about &quot; foreigners returning to the end of the qu@@ e@@ ue &quot; and &quot; jobs for the Austr@@ ali@@ ans first &quot; are a unpleasant return at the time when the unions were asking for a protected labor market , she said to the Austr@@ ali@@ an Indian Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , this meant that the work of the wh@@ ites had to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historical ar@@ te@@ stan@@ t .
The working document reports the 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former immigration minister Ch@@ ris Bo@@ en .
The Minister of Immigration B@@ ren@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss the trafficking of human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being under investigation .
If the &quot; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &quot; criterion was adopted , a visa see@@ ker could be checked to know &quot; if the job offer is auth@@ enti@@ c in the case where the candidate is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or person concerned within the company that spons@@ ors him &quot; .
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 4@@ 57 after some of them , having intended to spons@@ or a small number of workers , actually used hundreds .
Meanwhile , an asylum see@@ ker from 35 years old would be dead from a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers on the island of Chris@@ t@@ mas this week .
The son of the man , who was 9 years old , went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an adult c@@ ous@@ in who was also on board .
The man was urgently transferred by the Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities to the hospital of the island Chris@@ t@@ mas , where he died .
A study to increase the benefits of the H@@ S@@ 2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government .
The work done by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ it@@ d suggests that high speed services until Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of the P@@ ha@@ se 1 by 20@@ 26 .
The Minister of Transport b@@ ars K@@ ram@@ mer said that the project &quot; would bring together the United Kingdom &quot; .
Scottish Minister of Trans@@ ports , K@@ e@@ ith Brown said &quot; express &quot; the idea of working with the British government on the project .
P@@ ha@@ se 1 will be on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When the P@@ as@@ se 2 will be completed , the lines will serve Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of the construction of the high speed link between London and the north of England , going from 3@@ 2.@@ 7 million £ to 4@@ 2.@@ 6 £ .
The British government , which is in talks with Trans@@ sports S@@ co@@ t@@ land , asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the duration of travel for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travel@@ ing times between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh for three hours at the most .
The bar@@ on@@ ne K@@ ram@@ er said : &quot; Our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 is on a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer . &quot;
We push the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the benefits it presents are huge .
Without him , we are facing a problem of the ability of our rail network .
But it is also about developing the connec@@ tivity between the 18 major British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ it@@ ta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ c@@ el , added : &quot; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
For the Scottish government , K@@ e@@ ith Brown called on Mr Car@@ mi@@ c@@ el to support &quot; unequivocally &quot; the inclusion of Scotland in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &quot; The high-speed train has the potential to offer significant economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall project of high-speed rail network throughout Great Britain .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re therefore exc@@ ited about working in partnership with the British Government to look at the options for getting the high-speed train network to Scotland , creating a benefit for all and supple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m looking forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and we will then decide together the next steps . &quot;
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are still in force in Australia
Austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers will have to continue to switch their t@@ ab@@ lets and their smar@@ t@@ phones during the take@@ off and the landing despite the US gesture to rela@@ x the regulation of electronic devices .
The American Federal American Administration has left the door open to American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch vide@@ os or play games on their devices during critical flight stages provided they are in &quot; plane &quot; mode .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do it for most of the the@@ ft , but many people find it painful not to be able to access their electronic books during take@@ off and landing .
Austr@@ ali@@ an trans@@ porters are considering the decision that requires American carriers to do important work to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Authority Sa@@ fe@@ y Au@@ th@@ orial also said that she was looking at the announcement but pointed out that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight stages were still in force in Australia .
&quot; The CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft by plane &quot; , she said .
The question is the subject of a regulation that forces aircraft operators to guarantee permanent security and passengers to respect the safety instructions given by crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , who has already spoken to the CA@@ SA about its intention to expand the use of its enter@@ tainment system using the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology , was open to a change , but said it would follow the regulator .
&quot; We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that it would improve the customer experience now that we have ( of the enter@@ tainment system using the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology ) on our planes .
Q@@ an@@ t@@ as said that she respected the current rules for the time being .
&quot; According to our current policy , electronic devices can &apos;t be used during take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we do not intend to change this now , &quot; she said .
The FA@@ A &apos;s decision applies to American airlines .
However , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For American carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
Air@@ lines will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as review books , training equipment , hand@@ -@@ b@@ agg@@ age transportation program and instructions provided to passengers .
&quot; As soon as an air company checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can authori@@ ze passengers to use light electronic mobile devices , like t@@ ab@@ lets , e-@@ books read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones at all al@@ titudes &quot; , said the FA@@ A .
In the rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to switch their devices during the landing .
The group also recommended that heavi@@ er devices be safe under seats or in higher compar@@ tments during take@@ off and landing .

Singapore guarantee l@@ ords benefit from the middle classes forced to tighten their bel@@ ts
C@@ ho@@ o@@ sing a len@@ der at the B@@ end@@ em@@ er commercial center in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a de@@ poses a po@@ cell@@ let , a jo@@ ke and a bun@@ ch of gold ear shops to pay for the school fees of his d@@ augh@@ ters .
&quot; My hus@@ band and I just bought a house so all my money left inside &quot; says Mrs A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
While she ear@@ ns $ 3 000 in Singapore ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) per month as an ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ator and her hus@@ band also works , monthly family income is not enough , she does .
In fact , the demand is such in parts of Sou@@ theast Asia - where household indeb@@ tedness increases - that V@@ alum@@ i@@ x , where she has carried out her transaction , has become the third loan company to be introduced to the Singapore exchange .
P@@ utting out je@@ well@@ ers is not only a quick way to get liquid money - $ 1@@ ,@@ 300 in Singapore in the case of Mrs A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a - but it is almost as cheap as bank loans un@@ secured .
In general , the loan providers of Singapore take up an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by the United Over@@ sea Bank , a local fund provider with a branch branch in the same business center .
However , on the guarantee side has the advantage of not asking for cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or salary proof , and can release loans faster than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region turn to the pre@@ d@@ itors on offer while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and the over-@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by a monetary policy that is too weak in advanced economies , low-@@ income and average families turn to the pre@@ d@@ itors on offer to bridge the difference while their economies suffer a slowing .
This week , the credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora cited the growing indeb@@ tedness of households , resulting mainly from the increase in mortgage loans , as a risk factor for the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore had the highest indeb@@ tedness of households / gross domestic product in Asia .
Malaysia comes to the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , while this rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists also fear the high level of consumer indeb@@ tedness in Thailand , which is out this week from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continuous weakness in exports and a slowing down of consumer demand .
&quot; The balance sheet is that with rising costs , people in the middle or at the bottom of the salary are seeking to complete their income as they can &quot; , says S@@ ong S@@ en@@ g W@@ one , an economist at CI@@ M@@ B , an Malaysia bank .
The historically high prices of gold in the last two years have made people rush@@ ed to put their personal effects into effect to touch the cash value of their je@@ wel@@ ry .
In Singapore , about 70 % of the articles made available in the 200 loan shops on the guarantee of ci@@ é@@ -@@ state are in gold .
People say , &quot; the price of gold is high , let &apos;s make the gold channel of grand@@ mother clear and we will come back to it next month &quot; .
In Thailand , the biggest provider of loan loan shops , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using his shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the loan sector on the guarantee that V@@ alum@@ a@@ x , the shop operator in B@@ end@@ em@@ er and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore , plans to expand not only in neighb@@ oring Malaysia - where he already has four shops - but also outside of Asia , says Y@@ e@@ ah Le@@ e Ch@@ ing , its general director .
The company will finance them by using 60 % of the $ 66 million in Singapore that she removed this week when he was introduced to the Singapore exchange .
While some reduced l@@ enders have es@@ che@@ w@@ ed criticism for the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates they practice , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah indicates that the delivery offers not only lower rates than other l@@ enders , but also that it does not directly increase the debt .
&quot; The clients are selling property they already own , and the fact that their personal property is mone@@ tiz@@ ing does not increase household indeb@@ tedness , &quot; she says .
The building is better accepted socially as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term .
People who go to the l@@ unch l@@ unch are not only those who have financial problems .
The ai@@ ded people of Singapore also go to the V@@ alum@@ a@@ x guarantee shops to put in train gold l@@ ing@@ es or Ro@@ le@@ x mon@@ sters , which can represent up to 60 % of their buying price in cash .
We see clients from all sections of society .
&quot; It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments , or small companies that have cash needs to pass a difficult course &quot; , add M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes , they just need money very quickly .
P@@ ast@@ er accused of juven@@ ile pornography in New Scotland
A bos@@ s who took care of young people , in the H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x region in New Scotland , is accused of juven@@ ile pornography .
A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ud@@ g@@ ins , 30 years old , was arrested on Friday morning following sear@@ ches at his house and at the office of the National Council of Research where he works .
The B@@ ap@@ tist Church of Ty@@ ber@@ la@@ y , where the bos@@ s official , says it is deeply anno@@ yed by this news .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , the officials of the church indicate that Mr H@@ ud@@ g@@ ins has resigned from his post .
The bos@@ s was released under conditions .
He does not have to communicate with people under 18 and not access the internet .
He will appear in prov@@ in@@ cial court , in H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x , in December .
He makes himself into a Nazi uniform in the super@@ market , before being hun@@ ted out .
A man d@@ ressed in a Nazi uniform of a bre@@ w@@ ard with the gam@@ b@@ led cross was asked to leave an English super@@ market , customers complained to the management of the establishment that called the police , indicated the store of Friday .
&quot; We received several complaints from clients , so we asked him to leave the store &quot; , explained a spokesman for the super@@ market chain . As@@ da .
The magaz@@ ine called the police to rescue him , but &quot; the time she arri@@ ves , he was already left without es@@ sh@@ an@@ der &quot; , she added .
I was at the qu@@ e@@ ue when I saw a woman who seemed shocked .

&quot; You don &apos;t come out in the street unless you want to attract attention &quot; , testi@@ fied a cli@@ ent , Ros@@ ina Ru@@ si@@ in , 60 years old in the Cam@@ bridge Cam@@ bridge newspaper .

$ 3@@ 25 rescue plan for the health system of the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia
The federal government maintains that the $ 3@@ 25 M rescue package for the va@@ un@@ ting health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that government government will not waste funds .
The Federal Minister of Health T@@ an@@ ya Pol@@ liber@@ se@@ k announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is currently taking &quot; emergency measures &quot; to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic disease and the constraints of the system .
The funding , planned for 4 years , was decided after consultations of the government with the independent deputy of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia , An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&quot; The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that , in our opinion , will solve the unique difficulties facing the State , &quot; said Mrs Pol@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
The $ 3@@ 25 M plan includes a $ 31 M campaign for non-@@ urgent sur@@ gical operations .
2 600 additional operations , especially in the area of or@@ th@@ opa@@ que sur@@ ger@@ y and cat@@ ar@@ act , will help to catch up .
Funds are also planned for clin@@ ics without an appointment to H@@ ob@@ art and L@@ au@@ n@@ c@@ es@@ ton , better external care , training of medical frameworks , services dedicated to mental health and the deployment of electronic medical files in local hospitals .
&quot; These investments respond to the idea that , according to the first line clin@@ ics , this is the best way to treat T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , &quot; said Mrs Pol@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
The minister said that the government of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia would be faced with a strict regime for preparing reports and reporting .
The State will have to maintain current levels of funding to get money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds .
A commission composed of three people will be formed to ensure that the state provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible .
Today , Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said that the 3@@ 25 M $ will not count for much &quot; unless they are followed by a real reform to strengthen T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system &quot; .
Nevertheless , he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance he presented to the Prime Minister in early May .
&quot; I hope that the federal assistance plan will contribute greatly to removing the public health system of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia from the black@@ list , &quot; said Mr. Wil@@ k@@ ie .
According to government government , these non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But the spokes@@ person of the opposition opposition Peter Du@@ t@@ ton thinks that today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; fortune solution &quot; .
&quot; The reason why we are here is that the government government of the state has withdrawn 4@@ 30 M from its health system &quot; , he said on A@@ BC TV .
We can &apos;t have a government government that takes up almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth that puts 300 M $ , and pretend it &apos;s a good day .
Mr Du@@ t@@ ton visited Mrs Pol@@ liber@@ se@@ k to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent in additional bureaucracy .

Syria destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , says the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and filled am@@ muni@@ tion with toxic gas , declared the international chemical monitoring body on Thursday , while violent clashes were ra@@ ging in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian milit@@ ants also said Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost 3 years ago .
The announcement of the Organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( IA@@ C ) arrived with one day on the limit date of the period of the period of the of the time of the period of the of the time of the period of the of the time of the of the time of the period of the of the time of the of the time of the period of the of the time of the period of the of the time .
1 November set by the organization based in The Hague ord@@ ering Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &quot; make all production units of chemical weapons and machinery to mix toxic gas and fill am@@ muni@@ tion un@@ us@@ able &quot; .
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious calendar to destroy Dam@@ as@@ cus &apos;s chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014 .
Thanks to the destruction of equipment , Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves .
We think that the country has about 1 000 tons of chemical products and weapons , especially mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the s@@ ar@@ in neuro@@ toxic agent .
The announcement was made while the fighting was ra@@ ging on Thursday in the city of Sa@@ fia . According to the experts , a unit of production of chemical weapons and storage sites has been shelter , reported on the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory based in Britain .
The group of activists , following the evolution of the human balance thanks to a network of milit@@ ants based in Syria , said Thursday that 120 2@@ 96 people were dead .
Among them , we think there were 61 0@@ 67 civilians , including 6 3@@ 65 children .
On the side of the government , it is estimated that 29 9@@ 54 members of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad &apos;s armed forces have died , of which 18 6@@ 78 were fighters of pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 of Lebanon Hezbollah milit@@ ants .
Among the deaths , we also consider that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ ters and some 5 3@@ 75 of the opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people were dead in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since then .
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
The al-@@ Assad troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a groups , in Sa@@ fia for weeks .
The Observ@@ atory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but did not give any prec@@ ision .
The fighting has underlined the importance of the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which consists of removing Syria from its toxic arsen@@ al in the middle of a civil war that is going on , within tight deadlines .
A declaration of the IA@@ C , which works in close collaboration with the UN , indicated that its team was &quot; now satisfied with having checked - and seen destroyed - all declared critical production and machinery for mi@@ xing and filling &quot; .
She added that &quot; no other inspection activity was planned for the moment &quot; .
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They could not visit the last two sites because of concerns about their security , have indicated the inspectors .
Thursday , the O@@ IA@@ C said that the two sites were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program that they contained had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &quot; .
It was difficult to know at first sight if Sa@@ fi@@ a &apos;s unit was one of the two sites that the O@@ IA@@ C inspectors could not visit .
Syria submitted a plan of total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved in the following month by the O@@ IA@@ C executive committee .
&quot; I sal@@ ute the moral strength and courage that you all displayed in the context of the most difficult mission ever taken by this organization &quot; , said the director of the organization Ah@@ met U@@ zu@@ mon@@ c@@ u , in a comment published by the IA@@ C .
Now in his third year , the civil war is mainly opposed to the Sunni Muslim rebels in the al-@@ Assad government and its security forces , which are supported by members of the al@@ a@@ ye@@ i sec@@ t , a branch of Shi@@ ite Islam .
On the other hand , the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory said that there was a strong boom on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of La@@ ta@@ k@@ ia .
The cause of the explosion is still unknown , he added .
Col@@ ère caused by the punishment of one of the Bali bomb posts
The survi@@ v@@ ors and the relatives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the con@@ spir@@ ators to be brought to justice , saying that U@@ mar P@@ ate@@ ek should be shot by an implementing l@@ unch .
P@@ ate@@ ek , who spent almost 10 years in flight by being one of the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after men in Sou@@ theast Asia , was sentenced yesterday to a 20@@ -year prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks .
He could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
4@@ 5-@@ year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks aimed at two nigh@@ t@@ ages in the popular tourism neigh@@ bor@@ hood of Ku@@ a , which caused the deaths of 20@@ 2 people , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and made many injured .
He has also been convicted of many other charges in relation to terrorism , especially a wave of attacks aimed at churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The public prosecu@@ tors asked for a life sentence sentence , but they could have asked that the man , referred to as a &quot; M@@ an M@@ an &quot; for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs , be sentenced to death .
The decision revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Per@@ th who lost her two tw@@ ists from 39 years old , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction perpetrated by P@@ ate@@ ek and the other con@@ spir@@ ators almost 10 years ago .
On the edge of the te@@ ars , she said that P@@ ate@@ ek should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men .
&quot; He should be dra@@ gged in front of the implementing pe@@ g &quot; , said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en to the A@@ A@@ P .
I have to live every day without having other grand@@ children , nor see my girls .
The Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , charged with a gas gas outside , explo@@ ded just after 23 hours on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hu@@ gh@@ es was in P@@ ad@@ dy@@ &apos; &apos;s B@@ ar when a suicide bom@@ ber made you j@@ ump a hand@@ ba@@ g with explo@@ si@@ ves barely 20 seconds earlier .
He s@@ ank in the com@@ a after the attack and stay@@ ed un@@ conscious for a month , and he &apos;s &quot; dead &quot; three times while he was under res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr Hu@@ gues said that P@@ ate@@ ek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ ol@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a - who were executed 4 years ago .
In reality , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
K@@ e@@ eping him alive , why , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
S@@ pending 20 years in prison after killing 20@@ 2 people and injured hundreds of others , it &apos;s not a lot .
P@@ ate@@ ek is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being caught for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Ab@@ b@@ out@@ be@@ ad , where American forces will kill the former chief of al-@@ Qaeda , O@@ u@@ ous@@ ama bin Lad@@ en , less than four months later .
During the trial , an agent of the F@@ B@@ I said that reports from intelligence services revealed that P@@ ate@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet B@@ in Lad@@ en in order to re-establish links between the terrorist groups in Sou@@ theast Asia and al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a .
&quot; He di@@ dn &apos;t go &quot; , added Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
Until recently , he made fu@@ n of the gri@@ ef he could have caused to other people .
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by cere@@ monies in Bali and in Australia .
&quot; There will be a lot of be@@ ers this year , &quot; said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
However , P@@ ate@@ ek can use his sentence .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on board aircraft ( but not pass an appeal with their phone phone )
Pass@@ eng@@ ers &apos; passengers will be able to use their electronic front door devices to read , work , play games , watch films and listen to music - but not to talk about their mobile phone - under the new very expected directives published Thursday by the Federal A@@ vi@@ ation Administration .
But passengers shoul@@ dn &apos;t expect immediate changes .
The speed with which the change will be in place will vary from one airline to another , declared the directors of the FA@@ A Mic@@ hael Hu@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
Air@@ lines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their planes respect the new directives and that they update the training books for crew members and the rules regarding the con@@ spir@@ acy of devices to be in compliance .
The FA@@ A said that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ B@@ lu@@ e are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the plan , we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon &quot; , indicated the FA@@ A in a declaration .
At present , passengers have to switch their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed .
They are@@ n &apos;t supposed to r@@ ash them before the plane reaches an al@@ titude of 10 000 feet and the command gives its green light .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their devices during the plane &apos;s des@@ cent before the landing and do not r@@ ash them until the plane has started .
Under the new directives , the airlines whose aircraft are correctly protected from electronic interference will be able to authori@@ ze passengers to use their equipment during take@@ -@@ off , lan@@ dings and rolling rolling , said the FA@@ A .
Most of the new line planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to higher al@@ titudes , should meet the criteria .
L@@ ong G@@ lad@@ ing , the president of the Association of Pro@@ visi@@ onal F@@ light Wa@@ it , said himself happy with these changes .
&quot; Once the new policy implemented safely - and we &apos;@@ re going to work closely with the carriers for that - it will benefit everyone &quot; , explained G@@ lad@@ ing in a declaration .
We are frankly tired of feeling like &quot; room scre@@ ers &quot; when it comes to this question .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the internet for sur@@ f@@ ing , exchanging em@@ ail and SM@@ S or down@@ loading data below 10 000 feet , said the agency .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other aircraft aircraft .
So still no Wor@@ ds W@@ it@@ z Fri@@ ends , the online style game that the actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win played on his smar@@ t@@ phone in 2011 when he was expelled to a high noise of an American Air@@ lines plane after refusing to switch his de@@ vice while the de@@ vice was kept at the door .
And heavi@@ er devices like lap@@ top computers must always be row because they could inj@@ ure someone if they were flying through the cab@@ in .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The regulatory power regarding mobile phones belongs to the Federal Community Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A can remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take@@ off and the landing
Last month , Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of National Transport Sa@@ fe@@ y B@@ ard , national transport security expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , said that mobile phones were always considered a risk .
&quot; mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the F@@ C@@ C , that they could distur@@ b the mobile phone rela@@ ys if they are used on board &quot; , said Ros@@ en@@ ker .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government approves a broader use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has increased over recent years to rela@@ x restrictions regarding their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ ator C@@ l@@ aire Mc@@ Cas@@ k@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous .
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to switch their devices , or deliberately do it .
The FA@@ A started limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communications instruments when the passengers were carrying out radi@@ os F@@ M , high tech g@@ ad@@ gets at then .
New online planes depend much more on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
Air@@ lines allow their passengers to use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to cru@@ ise al@@ legi@@ ance for several years .
modified planes to welcome W@@ i-@@ F@@ i systems also better resist interference .
The vast majority of air@@ planes should allow the wider use of electronic devices under the new directives , said Hu@@ er@@ ta .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it radio transmission of much lower power than previous generations of devices .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic books , for example , only give minimum trans@@ missions when you turn a page .
But trans@@ missions are stronger when the down@@ load devices or send data .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is among those who press for rela@@ xing restrictions regarding the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , the leaders of society loaded a line plane of e-@@ books . K@@ ind@@ le and made him ste@@ al to see if there were problems , but there were none .
This inspired members of the FA@@ A advisory committee with mixed feelings about the question of whether the use of devices presents a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said that he thought that interference from aircraft was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee said that there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots who indicate that devices can interfere with an aircraft &apos;s system , and most of them are very old .
However , the committee recommended that the FA@@ A auth@@ oriz@@ es pil@@ ots to ask passengers to switch their equipment during the lan@@ dings to the instruments in conditions of low visibility .
A group of the travel@@ ing industry congratulated itself on the changes , calling them arrangements that are full of common sense for travellers with technologies .
&quot; We are happy that the FA@@ A recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security &quot; , said Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , president and director of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tr@@ vel Association .
A bir@@ d bir@@ d of a platform in the North Sea
A bir@@ d , hel@@ bed after being exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea , was released in nature .
We raised the water r@@ ank on board a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in the direction of A@@ ber@@ de@@ en last month before he was released by the Scottish S@@ PC@@ A in his rescue center in Al@@ o@@ a .
The director of the center , Col@@ in S@@ ed@@ don , said : &quot; This water r@@ ank was probably a winter of winter who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of violent win@@ ds in the North Sea . &quot;
It seems that the exhausted bir@@ d would have found refuge on the oil platform .
He added : &quot; He was unable to ste@@ al again , so we were cont@@ acted to help him . &quot;
The water r@@ ank was in good health when it was released .
Is the European elite ready to do business with Great Britain ?
The business campaign for Brit@@ ain was launched in April with the promise to assemb@@ le companies and define what the creat@@ ors of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
To this end , we ordered the wid@@ est and most complete investigation to British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , companies and the EU .
Y@@ ou@@ gh@@ v asked more than 1 000 business managers , overall representative of all the size of companies , sectors and regions of Britain .
The results of the investigation will be a surprise for many .
We discovered that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe , focusing on the countries that modern@@ ize and develop while the EU states are stag@@ n@@ ating .
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries like China , India and Brazil rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional ar@@ can@@ es .
When they ask their opinion on specific political points - ranging from the regulation of the monopolies to the laws on products - the majority of entrepreneurs think that the control of these key competences should go back to the hands of West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market has caused general dis@@ content , companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate compared to the benefits that there is to be part of the European trade zone - 40 % of big companies , which are traditionally the most pro-European , agree .
Last but not least , our investigation to business managers revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue the initiatives in favor of a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics .
This conclusion , which finds itself in all the big groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business community insists on a &quot; significant change &quot; that gives power to the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high - manage to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would allow a 16 % shift in votes in favor of maintaining the country in the EU during a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate the terms of Britain &apos;s accession to the EU .
It also shows that companies hope that the re@@ negotiation will represent a significant change in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of British companies , since the eurozone is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Great Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for companies it means putting the acc@@ ent on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels .

Alex@@ i Mill@@ er of Gaz@@ pro@@ m says that Bulgaria &apos;s gas pipeline in@@ aug@@ urs a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s biggest energy projects , declared Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s director .
&quot; An historic event took place today : construction started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most important project Europe &apos;s most important project &quot; , explained Alex@@ i Mill@@ er , the director of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , in a declaration on Thursday .
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent .
South Stre@@ am should help to diversify the export routes of Russia to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its Ukrainian counterpart , a country where the majority of Russian gas is transported to Europe , increases the level of risk compared to conventional lan@@ es , adds the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated &quot; forever &quot; .
Bulgaria &apos;s consumers will be receiving gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put in service in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m said that construction should start in other down@@ stream countries by the end of the year .
The gas pipeline was conceived for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic me@@ ters of natural gas .
Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world , announced on Thursday the New Year of Ta@@ hi@@ i , taking on an information from Rad@@ io Australia .
This island , east of the G@@ am@@ er &apos;s archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last British territory of the South Pacific , half way between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory measure 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , if we count three other small islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the mutilation of the Bou@@ ty , episo@@ de of the history of the English na@@ vy , which gives rise to three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adap@@ tations .
Some dozen inhabitants , in the majority of the des@@ c@@ endants of the mutilation of the Bou@@ ty , still live Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n , and their income depends 95 % of the generosity of London .
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a marine reserve around the little archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , that is , 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the may@@ or of the island went to London asking Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ n , the may@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n , thinks that the creation of such a protected zone would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island .
The project must be accepted by the English Govern@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanc@@ tu@@ ze these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided , however , that they have the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no Air@@ port in Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the zone , and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels .
As for France , it must already lead the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 of the French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia Z@@ E@@ E@@ E , neighbour of Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n .
The FA@@ A rela@@ xed restrictions on the use of electronic g@@ ad@@ gets on board aircraft - but it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones .

P@@ ris@@ on for life for a former Chinese deputy govern@@ or
A former deputy govern@@ or of the province of Ji@@ in in the north-@@ east of China was sentenced on Friday to life prison for corruption .
Ex@@ cep@@ t of the Communist Party in July 2012 , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of having affected more than 19 million y@@ u@@ ans of bri@@ bes , reporting the Chinese official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Govern@@ or , who was also the president of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public institution , helped companies and responsible to obtain contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first intermedi@@ ary court in Beijing on his micro@@ phone .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party .
If the head of the state promised that justice would also be in@@ trac@@ table with the powerful &quot; tig@@ ers &quot; that with the &quot; m@@ ou@@ ches &quot; - sub@@ alter@@ ation civil servants - only a handful of high-@@ ranking officials were convicted , including former executives of the oil giant Pe@@ tro@@ ch@@ a .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CC@@ P chief in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state .
But the government has not shown the intention to reform the anti-@@ corruption system by creating , for example , an independent party organization .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees accused of sexual assa@@ ults following allegations against J@@ on@@ a@@ than L@@ ord , during a ro@@ yal Commission audience .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees from New South Wales were accused of sexual assa@@ ults against children following claims made against the Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h educ@@ ator , J@@ on@@ a@@ than L@@ ord , in 2011 , at a ro@@ yal Commission hearing charged with sexual abuse of children .
But in his opening statement in front of the Commission , the Y@@ M@@ A said that he &quot; had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children within his organization &quot; .
The director General Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ ere was asked about two affairs : an employee of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was accused of crimes related to child pornography and a physical education mon@@ ster of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all was convicted of sexual assa@@ ults on children in the center where he worked in 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ ere said to G@@ ail F@@ ur@@ n@@ ess , a lawyer to the Commission , that he had known about the first case but he was not aware of the second one .
He also admitted that the Y@@ M@@ A opening declaration was in@@ accurate by stressing , &quot; external controls of the Y@@ M@@ A have been made and have indicated that the safety of children is an absolute priority for the organization . &quot;
It was shown in front of the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was informed that he had received the most poor assessments of four establishments in a quality audit of the De@@ par@@ t@@ ment of Education and Comm@@ uni@@ ties completed in August of this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who started working at Y@@ M@@ C@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that the management of staff was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he om@@ itted to verify that the employees knew they were obliged to report any violations of the child &apos;s security policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord was convicted for sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years when he worked for Y@@ M@@ C@@ A .
He was sentenced to a 6 years sentence in a minimum prison .
But Mr. Ha@@ ere rejected the idea that Y@@ M@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord &apos;s failures to the safety of children .
The staff testi@@ fied that they had observed certain flaws , especially the fact that Lord stay@@ ed alone with the children , that he kept them in private , made them sit on his k@@ nees , told them that he loved them and la@@ zy them to play with his phone phone .
Dan@@ i@@ el@@ ell O@@ ck@@ well , who was fram@@ ed by Lord and who asked for training in the protection of children because she was worried about her behavior , indicated that she found the service responsible of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h , J@@ ac@@ que Bar@@ n@@ at , who would be subject to Lord &quot; very da@@ un@@ ting and difficult to approach most of the time . &quot;
The Director-General said he rejected the testi@@ monies of the staff that they were re@@ tic@@ ent about the idea of reporting these flaws to their superi@@ ors .
Instead , he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have fo@@ isted their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Ha@@ ere said that he had expressed his point of view in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A advice of New Wales saying that , for the organization , the learned lesson of the &quot; J@@ on@@ a@@ than L@@ ord &quot; shoul@@ dn &apos;t have to do with the staff , and the advice agreed with him .
Mr Ha@@ ere said that the decision to make the staff sign of the confidentiality agreements , soon after the claims were made , was taken by the Man@@ aging Director of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A charge for services in the childhood , Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ ley .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an &quot; excess of z@@ è@@ le &quot; and that it had been badly implemented .
The Y@@ M@@ C@@ A of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than L@@ ord was an employee , namely between 2009 and 2011 , declared the expert on sexual violence on children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ m@@ all@@ one at the University of G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith in front of the Commission .
He said that there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in the recruitment , control , initi@@ ation , training and supervision of staff .
The audience was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister , but recognize that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term , the 5@@ 5@@ -year man made his opinion on various national policies known .
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country , Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as special envoy of the quar@@ tet for the peace process in the Middle East .
When we asked him if he would like to find the position of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to the E@@ ven@@ ting Stand@@ ard of London : &quot; Yes , of course , but it may happen , so ... &quot;
When many experts in the qu@@ é@@ qu@@ é@@ e protests met in Cardiff to face up to and win the trop@@ hi@@ e of the year , they knew that the competition would be ru@@ de .

It was only the second time he lived with T@@ off@@ e and we were cra@@ zy that he won .
On the path , people who di@@ dn &apos;t know it thought it was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to be photo@@ graph@@ ed with him .
This young bo@@ y , the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ ow V@@ ale , in the south of Wales , follows the trac@@ es of his ant Sharon H@@ ow@@ ls , who has participated in qu@@ é@@ qu@@ é@@ e competition for more than 10 years .
Mrs H@@ ow@@ ls said : &quot; There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging it and applau@@ ded it . &quot;
He went all the way along the path and even if he seemed to be very small , he did a wonderful job .
Fo@@ rest is cra@@ zy - he love hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors and the rural world and two ch@@ ick@@ ens he takes care of .
From the way he started , he will surely soon participate in the Ch@@ em@@ al demonstration of the year - and I &apos;@@ m sure he will make a nice performance .
A spokes@@ person for the annual question@@ er said : &quot; Well , only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his ap@@ y . &quot;
They form a good team .
The judges noticed that Pen@@ on and T@@ off@@ e presented well and the way they mar@@ ched on the path .
They are looking for effective team work between the pon@@ y and the ta@@ p - F@@ T@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e have been the best on the path .
I &apos;@@ m sure his beautiful clo@@ thes helped F@@ ent@@ on , he really was proud .
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal &quot; will be re@@ worked &quot;
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first page call for the release of a journalist accused of def@@ am@@ ation will be re@@ worked , says a press officer .
The New Ex@@ press based in Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou published a rare public call for the release of the journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Mr Ch@@ en later admitted on television that he had accepted bri@@ bes to make stories about a semi-@@ public society .
Now , New Ex@@ press will undergo a &quot; complete res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le &quot; , said the regulator .
The order of &quot; res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le &quot; comes from the Gu@@ ang@@ don administration for Pres@@ se and E@@ di@@ tion , Rad@@ io , F@@ il@@ m and TV .
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Ex@@ press , belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g group E@@ ven@@ ting Ne@@ ws , published several er@@ ron@@ eous articles on the society quoted Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion between September 2012 and August 2013 .
&quot; The writing of New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organized &quot; , said the regulator in a declaration .
He said he decided &quot; to impose an administrative sanction in Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press card &quot; .
He also &quot; ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g group E@@ ven@@ ting Ne@@ ws to undertake a complete overhaul of New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the people responsible in New Ex@@ press and immediately re@@ direct the newspaper management team . &quot;
Ch@@ en wrote several articles for the New Ex@@ press about alleged financial irregularities of a construction board manufacturer called Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion .
After his arrest , his newspaper twice published a call on the first page for his release , writing that he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted he published false stories about money .
&quot; In this case , I hurt Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion as well as the media industry and its ability to win public confidence &quot; , he said to the public television network C@@ C@@ TV .
I did it mainly because I was running after the money and the celebr@@ ity .
I realized my mistake .
Following the excus@@ es of Mr. Ch@@ en , New Ex@@ press published his excus@@ es on the first page , writing that he di@@ dn &apos;t properly verify his articles .
Several important suspects have recently done TV news .
Scienti@@ sts say that people are systematically forced to do their ad@@ ven@@ tures , despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to blame himself .
aircraft carrier Char@@ les@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le
In T@@ oul@@ on , aircraft carrier is in ra@@ in@@ age .
The lea@@ king of radioactive v@@ ap@@ our detected on one of the two nuclear he@@ at@@ ers of Char@@ les@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le , in mid-@@ October and while the ship was at sea , was &quot; safe for the se@@ am@@ en &quot; , but it &apos;s not without consequences for Mar@@ ine .
Indeed , the Ro@@ yal has just confirmed to us &quot; the un@@ availability &quot; of the ship until &quot; in mid-@@ November &quot; , &quot; the time to take the necessary corrective measures &quot; on the reactor .
On the other hand , the D@@ N@@ C company , speci@@ alizing in the defense comm@@ ute , ensures that its teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , dis@@ pat@@ ched in the V@@ ar for the occasion , &quot; intervene on aircraft carrier . &quot;
This is for them , among others , to change a p@@ ump on the faul@@ ty heat .
&quot; Everything is done to ensure that Char@@ les@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le can do its deployment planned at the end of 2013 &quot; , however , D@@ N@@ D .
And the National Mar@@ ine to certi@@ fy that &quot; it doesn &apos;t challenge the ship &apos;s activity program &quot; with nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion .
Let &apos;s remember that aircraft carrier Char@@ les@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le comes out of an intermediate interview period of six months .
He had equipment from T@@ oul@@ on in mid-@@ October for a training .
This , in particular , to describe young hunting pil@@ ots .
A &quot; little gre@@ y &quot; , sh@@ outs at the space contain@@ ment space , then produced on the am@@ ir@@ al ship of the French fleet .
According to the National Mar@@ ine , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , everywhere , I can see a lot of dis@@ content on the part of the people I meet : mon@@ str@@ ous re@@ evaluation of their properties , flood taxes , the cost of permits of all sorts , administrative expenses that will not end .
In short , si@@ ph@@ oning without limits to our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of dollars squ@@ ra@@ p could be saved to allow a much respectful tax for those who pay .
Any money taken from strength to taxpayers dimin@@ ishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impover@@ ishment .
In Sh@@ aw@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , we do not bo@@ ast about the s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ary expenses and the maintenance of lame duc@@ ks : the deficit cultural center , high subsidy to the Energy City , etc .
If these installations are not profitable , we sell them to private companies or demo@@ ise them .
It is also sad to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of several properties to host a major industry that has never come .
However , I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a kind of industrial in@@ convenience , but at what cost for tax pay@@ ers ?
It is not up to public pat@@ ro@@ ls to invest in such companies , but to the private sector based on the consumer &apos;s demand .
The citizens were happy to learn that la@@ kes in the P@@ ê@@ che and Pi@@ es will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
Following the departure of all industries ( big water consumption ) and the decline of the population , the use of water has greatly reduced everywhere in the territory .
Without wanting to say waste , the city will never miss water and the strict regulation about its use could be greatly ad@@ am@@ ant .
In short , it &apos;s easy to do big things with the money of others .
I would be ashamed to defend such a review .
With gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is not even able to buy a sty@@ l@@ o without going through a loan regulation .
We &apos;@@ ve been managed for more than 40 years with cr@@ acks with beautiful degrees for most of them and I do not think that a sheep farmer will make worse .
Op@@ en of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway line .
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric ra@@ ils , was discovered .
The American authorities have described the 4 feet tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they had ever seen .
The tunnel , z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag@@ ant on an equal length of about six long-term so@@ cc@@ er fields , links w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ j@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go , the United States .
The area is full of in@@ visible w@@ are@@ houses , which makes it easy to hide the tr@@ uc@@ ks responsible for drugs .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out by passing un@@ noticed , said the authorities .
The authorities confisc@@ ated 8@@ .5 tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel was discovered , according to the judicial files .
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were accused of having mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e with a sales intention .
They run a prison sentence from 10 years to life punishment if they are convicted .
In No@@ g@@ ales , in Ari@@ z@@ ona , the traffickers exploit vast underground dra@@ in@@ age channels .
The tunnel is the eigh@@ th important passage discovered in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the biggest tun@@ n@@ els were discovered following the mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in the center of Mexico in October , thereby posing a challenge for drug car@@ t@@ els that must quickly supply their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of about 700 y@@ ards equipped with railway lan@@ es that were from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of a Ti@@ j@@ ana house and went to two w@@ are@@ houses in San Di@@ e@@ go .
The British police issue an extradition mandate against Ass@@ ange .
Today , the British police issued an extradition mandate against the foun@@ der of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge in the É@@ qu@@ ate@@ ur Ambassador in London and asked for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said that she had delivered a &quot; surrender opinion &quot; against the Austr@@ ali@@ an of 40 years old , asking her to submit to a police officer , adding that if he did not do it , he would be likely to be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited to Sweden as a result of claims of sexual crime , after exha@@ u@@ sting every possible aven@@ ue under the British law after the Supreme Court invali@@ dated the call he inter@@ viewed against his extradition at the beginning of the month .
C@@ alling that Stockholm auth@@ oriz@@ es its transfer to the United States , he found refuge at the É@@ qu@@ ate@@ ur Ambassador in London on 19 June , asking this country of South America political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has &quot; delivered an opinion of surrender against a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man who asks him to present himself to a police officer , on the date and time of his choice &quot; , said a spokesman .
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under deposit .
The Am@@ bas@@ ade refused to comment on the issuing of the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange is afraid to be extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of sp@@ ying , after un@@ ve@@ iling more than 250 000 American diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website fighting secret information .
How Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics will inv@@ ade our lives
Fin@@ al words to be t@@ asked to access his smar@@ t@@ phone or pay his purchases ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognised by the biometric sen@@ s@@ ors of phones and computers .
Ber@@ n@@ ard Di@@ di@@ er , the deputy director of Mor@@ ph@@ o , even thinks that &quot; the century will be biometric &quot; .
Only biome@@ tr@@ ics will help to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a uni@@ verse and trans@@ national uni@@ verse as much as the internet .
Organ@@ iz@@ ations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this anno@@ ying for biome@@ tr@@ ics , but worry about it .
In 2011 and France , the National Commission of IT and liberties authori@@ zed 7@@ 74 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the shape of the hand or the ve@@ in@@ ous network of hand in companies , administrations , can@@ te@@ ens ...
&quot; Everyone will soon be able to be identified , anywhere and no matter &quot; , complained .
The reasons for such optimism , for some , and pessimis@@ m , among others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics will be based on new techniques , which will allow new services to be made to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are fingerprints , the hand of hand and the ve@@ in@@ ous network of the break or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&quot; For example , some people who work the concrete have the fin@@ gers very ab@@ ys@@ s and their fingerprints are il@@ legi@@ ble &quot; , notes Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , the technical director of the field of identity at Th@@ ales communications &amp; security .
And the collection and verification of the ve@@ in@@ ous network and the hand of hand require a voluntary and specific gesture from people .
It &apos;s at the same time a security - we can &apos;t get this data from them - and a disadvantage : the procedure must sometimes be repeated and take time .
Con@@ sequ@@ ence , research has been conducted for twenty years on other approaches , such as recognition of face or i@@ is ( the col@@ or@@ ful part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the increase in the prec@@ ision of sen@@ s@@ ors and the ability to calculate the computers necessary for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The prec@@ ision of fac@@ ial recognition has multi@@ plied by 10 over the last five years , calculate Cy@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ em@@ er , the director of R &amp; D laboratories in Ac@@ cen@@ te in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Hol@@ lan@@ de have deployed automatic border post@@ ers using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or an i@@ is on the movement .
&quot; Today , we are carrying out research on the recognition of the voice or the way of wal@@ king with sound sen@@ s@@ ors , but you need a silent environment &quot; , says S@@ r@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , director of security research to the In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
A unique and inf@@ alli@@ ble market , DNA also gives rise to hope and worries .
&quot; In the current state of knowledge , it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data &quot; , confirms S@@ op@@ hi@@ e V@@ ul@@ li@@ -@@ T@@ av@@ ou@@ deny , the director of the studies , innovation and the fore@@ sight to the C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive .
NE@@ C offers the judicial police services a su@@ it@@ case costing some 9@@ 0@@ ,000 euros to analy@@ ze DNA s@@ amples in the place of a crime and in an hour .
Bi@@ ome@@ try uses are divided into two groups : identification ( recognize one person among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( making sure that the person is the one she claims to be ) .
The identification has so far concerned the issuing of identity papers : you have to confront the biometric elements ( fingerprints , pho@@ to , i@@ is ) with the information that the State has on all citizens already posted .
This helps to ensure that a person does not try to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison can have other applications .
NE@@ C offers the recognition of V@@ V@@ P at the entr@@ ance of a ho@@ tel or a store .
&quot; We recover the pictures of the surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compare them to the photo@@ s of the cele@@ bri@@ ties circul@@ ating freely on the internet &quot; , explains Dan@@ y N@@ assi@@ f , who is responsible , at NE@@ C France , commercial development for biometric identi@@ fi@@ ers .
Another use is to take a pho@@ to a qu@@ e@@ ue that makes the qu@@ e@@ ue in a store , follow his progress thanks to fac@@ ial recognition and calculate waiting times .
The auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation concerned initially physical access ( borders , protected local , can@@ te@@ ens ... ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
It &apos;s added , more recently , the inspection control .
&quot; A Bi@@ ome@@ tric Po@@ st avoi@@ ds the phenomenon of the gir@@ l@@ friend who is leading for another &quot; , justify Cy@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ em@@ ay@@ u , Ac@@ cen@@ te .
But more and more , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also concern transactions , especially those made from devices connected to the internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to take money from some distributors by introducing his card and by putting his hand on a biometric read@@ er : this gesture re@@ places the strike of the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is tested at V@@ ill@@ en@@ eu@@ ve-@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and in Ang@@ ul@@ a by the Nat@@ ural Security society in partnership with banks and teachers from the big distribution : when paying in store with its bank card , the cli@@ ent does not ta@@ p his code , but introduces his finger in a read@@ er who sc@@ ares ve@@ in .
The experiment is planned for last six months .
If it is successful , the biometric read@@ ers could soon arrive at the French traders .
D@@ ays to reassure users
There are three ways to make biome@@ tr@@ ics attractive in the eyes of the general public .
The first is to explain that she can save time .
&quot; If , thanks to biome@@ tr@@ ics , a cli@@ ent is left with 30 seconds less , it &apos;s good &quot; , explains the director of a large area .
The second is to offer person@@ alized services : in a few years , a voice ser@@ ver will recognize your voice and offer you some options .
And finally , reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&quot; fingerprints are stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos;s identities are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure box , which gets blocked if you try to move it &quot; , lists Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , Th@@ ales .
But because of thorough studies , it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users .
Data protection specialists , they continue to worry .
&quot; The progress of fac@@ e-@@ recognition , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and the huge quantity of photo@@ s available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or Pi@@ ac@@ a , make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance &quot; , predicted An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , the privacy commissioner of the private sector in Canada .
A driver running 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink between leg@@ s has been me@@ ted out a £ 1@@ ,000 .
A car driver has been fin@@ ed £ 1@@ 000 for driving at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink balanced between his leg@@ s .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ y , 35 years old , from Ti@@ p@@ tre@@ e in Es@@ sex , was re@@ pai@@ red leading her Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 to B@@ ran@@ tre@@ e on 27 May .
When the police stopped it , they discovered the drink to take between its leg@@ s .
At the Court of First In@@ stance of C@@ he@@ ch@@ ester , H@@ ow@@ y admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention .
The seven points taken out of the permit led to a 6 month permit withdrawal .
H@@ ow@@ a has also been sentenced to pay fees of £ 90 and a sur@@ charge for £ 100 .
A tax on foreign property owners to blow up the London bubble
The trea@@ sury temporarily quanti@@ fied the measure of the tax on capital gains but waiting for a definitive decision by Mr O@@ bor@@ ne , who , in the 2012 budget , put a 7 % stamp of stamp for properties costing more than $ 2 M and annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually .
The right of stamp is already applicable to the residential properties of West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ton &amp; Ch@@ el@@ sea distric@@ ts , and represents 7@@ 08 M .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &quot; Following the increase in the right of stamp on the properties of high value and the introduction of the anti-@@ avo@@ idance law in this field , it is very difficult to progress that the properties of high value are under@@ tax@@ ed independently of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &quot;
&quot; But this change could make foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent about the idea of buying properties in London or the current owners who are reluctant to sell &quot; , he added .
R@@ ich real estate - the 5 to 10 % of the highest prices in the real estate market - in the prosperous sector located in the South West of London that is stret@@ ching from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ bl@@ d@@ on , increased by a record percentage of 11.@@ 8 % during last year .
The prices in the center of London have regular growth year in year of 5.@@ 6 % but have been over@@ shad@@ owed by a growing &quot; internal market &quot; , the sou@@ th@@ western city of the city , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and the east ( 6@@ .5 % ) knowing a recovery , according to the studies of Sav@@ ill@@ s .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted the way in which the movements of a dog &apos;s qu@@ e@@ ue are linked to his mood .
previous studies had revealed that happy dogs were more likely to win their qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while the nerv@@ ous dogs were w@@ aging it more toward the left .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and answer them .
Professor Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ science at the University of T@@ ren@@ te , said : &quot; Everyone knows that at home , the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimul@@ i that awa@@ ken positive or negative emotions . &quot;
Here , we tried to see what happened to other species .
He added that as well as at home , among dogs , the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement toward the left and vice versa , and that the two ho@@ sts played a different role in emotions .
To know more about how dogs react to the dis@@ ordered qu@@ e@@ ue movements of other dogs , researchers have followed animals watching films where other dogs were included .
They measure the heart frequency of animals and analy@@ ze their behavior .
It will surely not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ue is sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a explained : &quot; We presented mo@@ vi@@ e dogs where other dogs were located - either a nat@@ ur@@ alist version or a si@@ p@@ ple to avoid any other cause of confusion - and we were able to traffic the qu@@ e@@ ue movement and presented it as more to the left or the right . &quot;
When the animals saw a dog without saying the qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the point of view of the dog who w@@ ashed the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , they remained perfectly rela@@ xed .
But when they looked at a qu@@ e@@ ue for a qu@@ e@@ ue mainly toward the left ( again from the point of view of the dog who got the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , their heart frequency has accelerated and they looked anxious .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicate with them thanks to these movements .
He thinks rather that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &quot; If you meet several times with other dogs and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their qu@@ e@@ ue on the one hand is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude , you will react according to this experience . &quot;
Res@@ ear@@ chers indicate that the results could allow land@@ l@@ ords , ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arians and d@@ run@@ k to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The can@@ in behavi@@ ors expert John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a prof@@ essor invited to the Scho@@ ol Sci@@ ences of the B@@ ris@@ veterinary Sci@@ ences of the University of B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right at the can@@ e species .
Last year , a team of the University of L@@ inc@@ c@@ in discovered that dogs turned their head toward the left when they watched an aggressive dog and the right when it was a happy dog .
And in another scientific study carried out by Vic@@ tor@@ ia University in Canada , he said : &quot; The dogs go more easily to a ro@@ bo@@ t dog when his qu@@ e@@ ue w@@ ins toward the left rather than the right , instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study . &quot;
He said that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies di@@ dn &apos;t fully consider the animals of films or ro@@ bo@@ t dogs like dogs .
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
&quot; Although many elements , raised in different ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be specified - and dogs are no exception &quot; , he said .
However , given the ease with which their behavior can be registered , it will surely not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ue sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other .
Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys returns a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w because of Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner &apos;s disease
The group of ro@@ ck Ar@@ acti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys has moved a concer@@ t to G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w after we diagno@@ sed a lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis to his sing@@ er .
The She@@ ff@@ i@@ fe@@ ld group had to take place on Friday in the concer@@ t room The Hy@@ dro@@ o in the city center .
However , his lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis forced the sing@@ er Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner to re@@ program the show .
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concer@@ t to the L@@ G A@@ re@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham Thursday .
In a declaration on their official website , the Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys said : &quot; Following the decision to postpone the concer@@ t to the L@@ G A@@ re@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham tonight and after asking for a medical opinion , the Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys also has to postpone the show to the Hy@@ dro@@ o de G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w on Friday 1 November . &quot;
&quot; Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner is suffering from a lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis and regrets not being able to happen in concer@@ t . &quot;
The show at the L@@ G A@@ re@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham will take place on 20 November and the H@@ y@@ dro@@ o of G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w will be held on 21 November .

The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will name his first Car@@ d@@ inal in February
The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will appoint new Car@@ d@@ inal of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22 , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an Thursday .
Car@@ d@@ inal men are the highest church men in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect it , so Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will appoint his first group of men who will eventually choose his successor .
There are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
However , as soon as a Car@@ d@@ inal reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer participate in the election of a Pope - so it comes back to a group of 120 &quot; voters voters &quot; .
In a declaration announcing the news , the father Fa@@ der@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ bar@@ di , a spokes@@ person of the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an , said that a meeting with all the existing Car@@ d@@ ing@@ es would take place before the ceremony during which b@@ ish@@ ops will be raised with the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as the name of consent .
&quot; The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is decided to communicate his decision to conven@@ e the February con@@ spir@@ acy in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Car@@ d@@ inal in different parts of the world &quot; , said Lom@@ bar@@ di .
J@@ ack Val@@ er@@ o of the Ca@@ thol@@ ics said that by February , the number of voters will probably decrease .
He said that a Pope usually called as many Car@@ d@@ inal as he needed to be so that the number of voters in the electorate could reach 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 years old he wanted .
The cons@@ is@@ ir of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of the Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is in March of this year , said Val@@ er@@ o .
For the moment , there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and especially Italy .
&quot; It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will call car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance &quot; , he added .
40 % of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of car@@ din@@ als represent them .
Car@@ d@@ inal will also be the first to be chosen since Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is formed the Car@@ d@@ inal advice , a group of eight Car@@ d@@ ing@@ es from all over the world to look at ways to reform the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided alone .
&quot; From now on , Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is chose these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him &quot; , explained V@@ alert .
He added that he was &quot; perfectly possible &quot; that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is asks the Car@@ d@@ inal .
But we never experienced such a situation - it is completely new .
Val@@ er@@ o pointed out that the pa@@ ves generally raised b@@ ish@@ ops representing large communities in the class of Car@@ d@@ inal , but Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is was &quot; full of sur@@ prises - so we don &apos;t know who he will name &quot; .
G@@ M reminds some of its new p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps in the United States
General Mo@@ tors C@@ o reminds about 19 000 of his new@@ est Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ let Sil@@ ver@@ ado and G@@ M@@ C in 201@@ 2014 to solve a problem with the files that are already in hand , according to a declaration on Friday of the American body responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps , the seats before could present a default with regard to the inc@@ lin@@ ation mechanism .
As a result , the files do not respect the federal safety standards of vehicles regarding the e-@@ heads .
&quot; If the vehicle is reduced by the back , it may be that the e-@@ head does not properly protect the passengers , thereby increasing the risk of injuries &quot; , according to the declaration displayed on the site of the National High@@ way Tr@@ ash S@@ af@@ y Administration ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) .
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of G@@ M pit@@ falls started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and its restructuring in 2009 .
G@@ M informed the default owners of the default in the first half of October .
The N@@ H@@ T@@ SA could not look at the letter of information to the land@@ l@@ ords because of the 16 days stop of government activities , which slow@@ ed up the growth of vehicle sales in October .
The sales of Sil@@ ver@@ ado and Sierra , which were re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , increased by about 20 % during the first 10 months of the year , said G@@ M Friday .
In October , G@@ M sold 42 6@@ 60 p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and 16 50@@ 3 p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps Sierra .

A worker dies in concrete blocks .
A construction worker is dead buried under dozens of concrete blocks , Thursday the day before noon in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The drama occurred at 11 : 00 , on the Mar@@ qu@@ et@@ te street , near the inter@@ section of the Be@@ au@@ well street , in the Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La L@@ ess@@ er Patri@@ e distric@@ ts .
In all probability , work on the foundations was taking place there for some time .
A b@@ rick wall of foundation foundation had just been built in the last few days .
The accident occurred when the victim came to the site to recover her tools .
I went to car and saw the wall collap@@ sing with a big smoke nu@@ b , said Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I &apos;@@ m un@@ locked and I went to remove the big b@@ ric@@ ks that recovered .
We only saw a portion of his back , that &apos;s so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an old man in the fif@@ ty-@@ fifty who worked for a business of co@@ ff@@ er .
Re@@ anim@@ ation man@@ eu@@ vers were tried by emergency services , but without success .
The man did not survive his serious injuries .
An inspec@@ tor of the Committee on Health and Security of Work was sent to the place to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama .
Obama vo@@ ter of despair
I voted twice for President Obama .
He says that Obama made pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy efforts because of the obstruc@@ tion@@ ism of the Republican Party .
obstruc@@ tion@@ ism does not excuse the difficulties of the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are site , nor the dr@@ one attacks .
The memory of Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign
N@@ ath@@ i@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is a student in the 2@@ n@@ d year of medicine at Har@@ v@@ ard &apos;s F@@ ac@@ ul@@ ity .
I &apos;@@ m in the process of reading a very sad book these days .
It &apos;s a book that I thought would encourage me during the per@@ missi@@ veness of the second year of medicine and give me hope .
He is called &quot; The Aud@@ it@@ ty to W@@ in &quot; and these are the mem@@ irs of Barack Obama &apos;s presidential campaign in 2008 .
When I ended the medical records of my patients in the evening and that I am la@@ ugh@@ ing , this book brings me back to the time when policies were inspired by millions of people and where speeches could cut you off .
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presen@@ tations of news newspapers took time to think about the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des cry joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found .
A young vision@@ ary team was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition period before taking office in 2008 , he had 82 % fav@@ orable opinions .
And then I close the book .
Re@@ turning to the present is a difficult alarm , it &apos;s like coming out of a dream .
It &apos;s hard to remember these days full of optimism , they are like far memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted .
It had nothing to do with what I imagined .
I put Obama &apos;s credit on great achievements , since the passage of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ( affordable care law ) until the departure of Iraq from our army , passing through the end of &quot; neither seen nor known &quot; and the murder of O@@ u@@ ama B@@ in Lad@@ en .
Also , I think that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But having repeatedly defended Obama &apos;s administration against my pe@@ ers and my colleagues , I can &apos;t give explanations any@@ more .
I &apos;@@ m on the ver@@ ge of political despair .
republic@@ an ob@@ struction can &apos;t explain the out@@ cry of foreign leaders , nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collecting data on the privacy of the Americans , nor the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers who reveal the mis@@ deeds of the government .
She can &apos;t justify the murder of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , nor the evasion of public funding and the excess of the expenses allowed during the presidential elections .
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media silence are the &quot; most aggressive ... since the administration of Ni@@ xon &quot; .
And , more recently , she can &apos;t excuse the im@@ possibility of design@@ ing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what I expected .
If , at 18 years old , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preced@@ e it .
Obviously , the electoral function is not predictable , because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance , like the massacre in New@@ ton , influence our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration .
That &apos;s what anno@@ ys me most .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was exc@@ ited by his candi@@ dat@@ ure .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a confused and un@@ refin@@ ed alternative that di@@ dn &apos;t seem to allow to determine his policies or positions .
I felt that Obama , elected for a second term by being free from the pressure of future elections , would get the promises he was hearing about for so long .
Yet while the fav@@ orable opinion index plun@@ ged under 45 % this week , it &apos;s even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I don &apos;t care about the many promises that went on .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton at the Pri@@ ur@@ may@@ ies of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting , he told his team that they had to get back on the right path and remain loyal to their cause .
&quot; I want us to focus on our talent &quot; , he said .
We must remember who we are .
We &apos;@@ ve been here 5 years later , Mr President , and I don &apos;t agree with you any@@ more .
The views expressed in this comment are only those of N@@ ath@@ i@@ el Mor@@ ris .
On Friday , at 3 : 00 , a violent col@@ lis@@ ion between a motor@@ cycle and a car occurred street from Re@@ tin@@ ne to F@@ l@@ é@@ on .
The mo@@ on , J@@ on@@ a@@ than , 26 years , from F@@ l@@ é@@ on , did not have a cas@@ que .
Despite the quick emergency intervention , he died during this fron@@ tal col@@ lis@@ ion .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims that the deputy Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest about the system of parental leave .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire deputy C@@ live Pal@@ mer argues that Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his girls could be pregnant and enjoy this system .
The store of mining extraction , which con@@ tests the payment of a carbon tax of an amount of 6 M $ . made this argument to try and remove questions about a possible conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Par@@ ty could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding if carbon and mining taxes should be deleted .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and pointed out that the girls of Mr. Ab@@ bot@@ t were ready to benefit personally from these policies .
&quot; It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his d@@ augh@@ ters is pregnant , it will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave &quot; , said Mr. Pal@@ mer .
Two months after his election , the electoral commission officially stated that Mr. Pal@@ mer won the sie@@ ge of S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast of Fa@@ il@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes , after re@@ counting .
Mr Pal@@ mer put forward the idea of re@@ working the bal@@ lots system to speed up the process .
The girls of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , Fr@@ ann@@ es and Bri@@ d@@ g@@ let .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished ?
&quot; We need a better system &quot; , he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your coordination in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6 : 30 the next morning ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticized the use of paper cr@@ acks to score the ballot papers .
Is it to be able to er@@ ase the result if someone does not agree ?
Today , having a paper paper seems extraordinary .
The electoral commission has studied possible options regarding the electronic vote and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for the S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he would take his new functions &quot; very seriously &quot; .
The exercise of public functions is a question of public service .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re not looking for rewards , except the rewards of history because we must serve the community at a critical time &quot; , he added .
A team of bi@@ olog@@ ists led by the Wil@@ d@@ life conser@@ va@@ tions Society in New York has identified a new species of d@@ au@@ ph@@ in to work off the northern coast of Australia .
Th@@ ou@@ ba@@ ut Bl@@ ou@@ ou@@ x , responsible for the scientific mission to the Observ@@ atory for the Con@@ ser@@ vation and Dis@@ it@@ ude of A@@ ni@@ ev@@ es and Mi@@ locations Mar@@ ins ( O@@ C@@ ES@@ M@@ M ) comes back to L &apos;@@ Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Does the discovery of this new species of dol@@ ph@@ in to work surprise you ?
It &apos;s good news , but it doesn &apos;t surprise me especially .
If in the past , species have been described and identified on mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ atomic and geographical basis , today , the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics allow us to improve our knowledge in science about the classification of species .
It &apos;s also not impossible for these advances in gene@@ tics and m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology to challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a gender , a family , or even an order .
At the beginning of the 19@@ th century , mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ists classi@@ fied animals , based on the mor@@ pho@@ logical differences between species .
Today , some of these ran@@ kings are called into question because of the progress of gene@@ tics .
Similarly , two species very close to mor@@ pho@@ logically have been distinguished thanks to gene@@ tics .
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified .
A dozen years ago , the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-@@ family : the Pacific d@@ wel@@ lers and the wh@@ ales to work in the Atlantic .
The recent analysis helped to distinguish four species .
Why is it an important discovery , as the Wil@@ d@@ life conser@@ va@@ tions Society said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences to protect the species and therefore its genetic vari@@ ability .
If this population was already known for a long time by researchers , they di@@ dn &apos;t know that it was part of a new species , present only in this place .
So , if a massive death problem caused by a vir@@ al epidemic or acci@@ dental catch arises in the region , we could have a case for the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widespread on Earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered threatened or endangered according to the number of people existing on Earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it will recover from its neighbors .
As for the species Sou@@ sa in@@ sensitive , whose population of the new species discovered is out , its stock has automatically become lower , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ genous housing , open , in which there is a lot of genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This gen@@ e-@@ bre@@ wing limits the creation of new species .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , more closed ecosystems encourage genetic isolation , which can eventually create new species .
We have to know that the marine environment is the least well known environment .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts on Mar@@ s , rather than knowing what &apos;s living in the so@@ se of Mar@@ ann@@ es , only 11 km from the surface of the sea .
We spend more money in looking for life on other plan@@ ets than in marine research and it &apos;s high time that changes .
R@@ B@@ S suspended two traders on the exchange market
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its division of exchange markets based on two sources close to the file , which shows once again that the global investigation of the regulators on suspicion of currency manipulation is starting to bear fruit .
Some of the biggest banks in the world , especially U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they &apos;@@ re cooperating with the regulators in the context of the surveys on the most important financial market in the world , where $ 5.@@ 3 tril@@ lions of dollars are changing each day .
The two traders are the first employees of R@@ B@@ S to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation that echo@@ es the scandal of manipulation of the Lib@@ or inter@@ bank rate .
The bank , which refused to comment on suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month having received requests for information from the regulators .
&quot; The ongoing investigation on this affair is continuing and we &apos;@@ re cooperating fully with the F@@ C@@ A and other regulators &quot; , said a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the file said that R@@ B@@ S had transmitted issues of em@@ ail and in@@ stant messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , the British regulator , the Financial Con@@ du@@ t Authority .
This tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as the European official trading officer for the currencies at J@@ P@@ M@@ organ@@ an .
Ro@@ h@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , a European official of the exchange sw@@ im@@ ming at C@@ out@@ i , was put on leave this week , while Mat@@ t G@@ ard@@ in@@ er , a personal de@@ vice of currency at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S , was suspended by Stand@@ ard Char@@ ter@@ ed this week .
None of these traders have been accused .
Mr. U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s file included in@@ stant messages sent to and by bankers working at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ ti@@ group , added sources close to the file .
U@@ B@@ S explained this week that she had taken action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , said he was investigating suspic@@ ions of the exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities - the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , Swiss competition authority W@@ e@@ k@@ o , the F@@ A , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - look at the claims made about bankers who would have heard to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ M@@ organ@@ an and C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland have also launched internal investigation or received requests from the regulators , have indicated sources close to the file .
The banks are throwing the in@@ stant messages and the em@@ ail@@ s sent for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
The news about these surveys has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment banks &apos; tra@@ pping units in recent years , but which has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits the opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers tried to down@@ play the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast liquid exchange market highly liquid , but senior traders explain that it &apos;s not necessarily true .
A sen@@ ior tr@@ ick said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms &quot; explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market with a low cost .
The news arrived on the same day that the C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland announced having sent a tra@@ der working in its fund office negotiated the London stock market this week after it caused a loss of $ 6 M at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and worked with the regulators .
&quot; We are convinced that the tr@@ ick has acted alone and that the case has been ma@@ stered &quot; , indicated a representative of the C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland .
The investigation on the may@@ or Ro@@ b Ford was bot@@ ched , supports a lawyer
After the police confirmed having put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Ro@@ b Ford smo@@ king out of the cr@@ ack , M@@ e C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by supported it never seen such a bot@@ ched investigation .
M@@ e Ru@@ by said believe in La Pres@@ se Canadian that the police had &quot; ignored or minim@@ ized &quot; the evidence of proof against the may@@ or .
This Thursday , the police stopped the occa@@ sional friend and driver of Ro@@ b Ford , Alexander Lis@@ i , 35 years old , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion relative to the video .
Alexander Lis@@ i , formerly accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police said that they also observed this man who deli@@ vers co@@ ol@@ s to Ro@@ b Ford , indicate new court documents .
M@@ e Ru@@ by called &quot; in@@ explic@@ able &quot; the fact that the police never sear@@ ched the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford or his house , or put on listen to his phone , arguing that the police chief Bill Blair chose in knowledge of the cause not to act against the may@@ or .
Under the law , the police , having been witness to suspect transactions in clean hands , could very well have inter@@ cep@@ ted the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford , stopped the may@@ or , and carry out a search - even without a mandate .
She could also have requested an in@@ stant search mandate , if deemed necessary .
The police chief ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t commented , but his spokesman Mar@@ k P@@ u@@ waste qualified the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by as &quot; obvious and desperate attempt &quot; to assert himself with the media in a case that doesn &apos;t matter in any way .
In the press conference , Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &quot; reasonable motives &quot; that could lead to a criminal charge against the may@@ or .
European stock markets are falling in the middle of the session , except London
With the exception of London , the main European stock markets are declining on Friday in the middle of the session , pl@@ agu@@ ed by some news of disappointing companies , while W@@ all@@ -@@ Street is expected to increase .
On the other hand , investors remain cautious because they think that the US Federal Reserve could un@@ lock its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , after the announcement of inflation at 0.@@ 7 % for the entire eurozone , the idea is repeated among market players that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
Wall Street &apos;s future suggests an increase in US actions on the increase , after two con@@ spir@@ acy sessions .
To the values , Rena@@ ult ( -@@ 4.@@ 63 % ) recorded the highest re@@ bel@@ lion of CA@@ C 40 , coupled with the warning on the result of its partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor Friday .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) marks the worst performance of Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ star@@ 300 , after having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a de@@ vice structure ( &quot; bad bank &quot; ) involving 38 billion of the most risky assets .
For its part , Vo@@ od@@ af@@ e ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) keeps up in the head of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ star@@ 300 increases in reaction to press news that A@@ T &amp; T studies a possible takeover bid .
On the exchange market , specul@@ ations about the evolution of the monetary policy of the ECB are going well , as John Har@@ dy testi@@ fies , stressed at Sa@@ x@@ o Bank .
The ECB &apos;s unique mandate has always focused on inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reasons to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
We anticipate a strong potential for a reduction in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its re@@ be@@ lling against the American currency and has reached a lower of two weeks at 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 dollar .
The same con@@ jec@@ ture , on the other hand , supports the eurozone bond market .
The Supreme Court valid@@ ates the reform law of Obama &apos;s health system
A big victory for the Obama administration : the American Supreme Court said today that Obama &apos;s reforming the health system was constitutional .
By 5 votes against 4 , the judges valid@@ ated the individual mandate of the P@@ ati@@ ent Pro@@ tec@@ t and Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ( law on the protection of sick people and affordable care ) - which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise you have to pay a penalty - and have said it &apos;s constitutional under the government &apos;s power of tax .
The president of the Supreme Court , John Rob@@ er@@ ts , r@@ alli@@ ed back to the four most liberal members of the Court , while the judges S@@ c@@ lia , Thomas , A@@ li@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy expressed their disagreement .
The Court also valid@@ ated other sections of the law of 2 700 pages and , moreover , considered that the provision of the reform law of the health system , which states that we have to lower the threshold of eligibility to Mé@@ dic@@ aid . Otherwise , it &apos;s coer@@ cive according to the constitution to lose all federal funding of the program .
The procedure to block the law has been committed by 26 states and the National Federal Federation of Independence .
All the major republic@@ an candidates in the presidential election in the course of the pri@@ mar@@ ies in 2012 , including the candidate nominated Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , were fier@@ cely opposed to the law .
Thanks to the former combat@@ ants in M@@ end@@ on .
At the heart of the c@@ eme@@ ter@@ ard of the Tr@@ ou@@ bu@@ qu@@ et , civil , religious and military authorities , as well as many patri@@ otic associations , this Friday afternoon , a tribute to the soldiers and dec@@ e@@ ased from all the wars was paid .
There have been ger@@ bes in two of the three military square soldiers of the c@@ eme@@ tery by the may@@ or Jean-@@ Claude Gu@@ i@@ bal and various person@@ alities .
Acc@@ ep@@ tance between Palestinians and Israelis at the border of Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers w@@ ounded on Thursday 31 October 2013 at night during a violent c@@ up at the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power plant in the Gaza stri@@ p stopped working on Friday , 1 November after exha@@ u@@ sting its fuel reserves , announced the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve Authority .
A local comm@@ an@@ der@@ ant of the A@@ zz@@ e@@ din Al@@ b@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ g@@ ade , K@@ hal@@ ed Ab@@ ou B@@ ak@@ r , and another framework of the armed arm of the Hamas , Rad@@ e@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a sh@@ it@@ ty sh@@ it in an Israeli army incur@@ sion to the east of K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ n@@ ès , in the south of the Gaza Strip , according to local medical sources .
Two other local leaders of the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ ass@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ oud , died when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters were leading a monitoring operation in the border area between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
An attack on a tunnel deeper by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli car and a bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it have made an inc@@ al@@ sion of a hundred me@@ ters inside the territory before then withdrawing .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communication , a spokes@@ person for Hamas , S@@ am@@ i Abu Z@@ ou@@ h@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &quot; her@@ o &quot; and said that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ass@@ am who fell by defending the territory during an inc@@ eption of the Z@@ ion@@ ist occup@@ ant in K@@ an Y@@ ou@@ n@@ ès .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&quot; Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &quot; , threatened the spokes@@ person .
For its part , the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was at the beginning a section of a wide tunnel in Israeli territory since the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , discovered on 7 October and destined , according to the army , to &quot; terrorist activities . &quot;
Hamas claimed the use of tun@@ n@@ els to fight against Israel , specifying that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military release .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive en@@ sla@@ p aimed at the forces of T@@ as@@ ha@@ al ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israeli At@@ t@@ acks in the north of Syria
&quot; This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians &quot; , also indicated the spokesman of the army Peter L@@ er@@ ner .
On the other hand , Israel has struck an air military base in the north-@@ west of Syria , aiming for a series of missiles for the Lebanon Shi@@ ite movement . H@@ i , reported on Thursday 31 October the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite channel .
An American official confirmed an &quot; Israeli strike &quot; but did not give details about the target .
&quot; In the past , the targets were transferred missiles to Hezbollah &quot; , was happy to add .
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
Ex@@ cep@@ t &quot; exclusive sources &quot; that she ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t named , the Saudi capital channel indicated that &quot; the bombing was targeted at a series of sol@@ -@@ air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon &quot; , referring to the powerful Shi@@ ite movement Lebanon fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .
Ear@@ lier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory , reported several explo@@ sions heard on the d@@ aw@@ n Wednesday in an air defense base at S@@ on@@ ar J@@ ab@@ l@@ é , near L@@ attacked , on the coast of Syria .
This organization relying on a network of milit@@ ants and medical sources was not able to identify the origin of the explo@@ sions .
Re@@ turn in black and white for Mari@@ e Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , who presents to Dan@@ se Dan@@ se its two new group char@@ ge@@ rap@@ es : the first inspired of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ h@@ es &apos;s en@@ c@@ endants and po@@ ems , the second in@@ sti@@ lled by the famous so@@ ano G@@ y@@ m@@ ne@@ dia &apos;s so@@ ap so@@ lo@@ s .
A party that allows to see all the pr@@ ism of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , art with the wh@@ ites and black ink in white .
A white scre@@ en serves as a basic wall .
On the car@@ pet , which is also white , in the immense space that The@@ at@@ ri@@ ère is in , advance , profile , end like a line and clo@@ thes in black , a body .
On the scre@@ en , an ink of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ he@@ au is planned .
The body , simple , takes its shape .
And this form will be that of the whole coin : a bun@@ ch of physical im@@ itation of draw@@ ings .
The d@@ an@@ s@@ ers , completely clo@@ thes of black , only their hands and the un@@ discovered face , wait on each side of the game game , rush when the next grap@@ h appears , inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ate , come out in the current .
This black and white game by Hen@@ ri Mic@@ he@@ au is taking place in the rel@@ ay of so@@ lo@@ s , in united group ( a mass that is sol@@ o ) , in a large group of 12 so@@ lo@@ s where everyone carries out his sign .
We &apos;@@ re thinking of &quot; G@@ l@@ air in the morning &quot; where , in sol@@ o , Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard was carrying out a series of written ch@@ or@@ e@@ try tasks on car@@ t@@ els , online in the front stage .
It &apos;s the same principle , the giant Power Po@@ int version .
Here , music is strong , per@@ cu@@ red and electrical .
Energy is high , the pace always fast .
There will be a break when Car@@ ol Pri@@ or will take refuge under the d@@ ance car@@ pet , to hand over , micro@@ phone in hand , without so@@ bri@@ ety or moderation , a portion of the po@@ em of Mic@@ hel@@ le , Mon@@ c@@ or@@ de and mon@@ ot@@ one in the scre@@ w , and will continue by d@@ an@@ cing .
And the music to leave , and the sequ@@ ence to resume .
This sound and energe@@ tic discharge , long , if it happens , ends up attacking and sin@@ king .
Like the regul@@ arity of the visual pace .
There are a few nice fl@@ ash@@ ers - the creation of images has always been a force at Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard - like those ha@@ ir f@@ uc@@ king off or these black tissu@@ es that increase the lines .
But the cha@@ otic approach lacks composition .
We have the impression that the ch@@ or@@ é@@ g@@ rap@@ he , instead of going to the meeting of Mic@@ hael , has imposed himself , with his ti@@ ps .
Re@@ sul@@ t : the bodies seem to be at dish in front of draw@@ ings .
Mic@@ hael &apos;s hen@@ ch@@ men , like G@@ es@@ tal@@ t forms , open a larger and gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic imag@@ inary than d@@ an@@ cing , more por@@ ous .

The audience liked , the welcome was warm .
The G@@ yp@@ n@@ works , after the en@@ act , is richer .

On the scene , they pass the couples , in lo@@ vely , very sen@@ sa@@ tional , even ero@@ tic .
Fri@@ ends of group , small so@@ lo@@ s of transi@@ tions , which are moving around , shocking , writing is less bin@@ ary .

Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g and Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i are subject to legal proceedings concerning patents .
The group that own@@ s thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents has started an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of legal proceedings in the field of patents on Thursday against mobile phone producers , especially Google , the company he ha@@ st@@ ened at the post during the auc@@ tion of patents that took place after the bankruptcy of Nor@@ tel .
R@@ c@@ k@@ star , the cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um that acquired Nor@@ tel patents for 4@@ .5 M@@ d , has lod@@ ged a complaint against Sam@@ sun@@ g Elec@@ tr@@ ics C@@ o L@@ t@@ d , H@@ T@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for a patent violation in front of the United States &apos; Court of As@@ sho@@ ot in T@@ ex@@ as .
Ro@@ k@@ star is held jointly by Ap@@ ple , Micro@@ soft , Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , Eri@@ ric@@ sson and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of having violated seven patents .
Pat@@ ents contain technologies that allow an adverti@@ sement in connection with research terms on the internet , have indicated the conclusions of the trial , which is the heart of Google .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ k@@ star .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and H@@ T@@ C make tele@@ phones that work under Google &apos;s An@@ dro@@ id operating system , which gives fier@@ cely competition to Ap@@ ple mobile products and Micro@@ soft .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of $ 900 M for Nor@@ tel patents .
Google has increased its offer several times , finally proposing $ 4.@@ 4 .
After having lost Nor@@ tel patents against Ro@@ k@@ star , Google acquired the following Mo@@ tor@@ ola Mob@@ il@@ it@@ y for a $ 12@@ .5 M@@ d amount , a market partly based on Mo@@ tor@@ ola &apos;s patents libr@@ ary .
&quot; Although having failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in the auc@@ tion , Google violated and continues to violate these patents , have indicated the conclusions of the trial .
Ro@@ c@@ k@@ star demands more damage and interests against Google , because he claims that Google &apos;s patent violation is stub@@ born , according to the complain@@ ant .
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ itation of a house in G@@ es@@ ves : a faul@@ ty water driver
The grand@@ mother would have lit a cigarette during a gas le@@ ak .
The explo@@ ding of a housing in G@@ es@@ ves , which did two serious w@@ ounded on Friday morning , a 5@@ 5-@@ year-old grand@@ mother and her 5 years grand@@ son is due to a gas le@@ ak from a faul@@ ty water driver , indicated on Friday night the replacement of the chief of the Ro@@ i .
The expert sent out there by the par@@ et ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely acci@@ dental .
The grand@@ mother lit a cigarette while there was a flight and a buil@@ d-@@ up of gas .
The vital prog@@ no@@ sis of both victims is still committed .
The grand@@ mother was planned by the explosion and is bur@@ ned bur@@ ned .
The little bo@@ y , who was in his grand@@ father and his partner , was on his side and was bur@@ ned slightly .
&quot; The two victims were in@@ tu@@ b@@ ated and long condi@@ tioned on the spot before being taken to the C@@ ome of Li@@ è@@ ge , she in hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , her am@@ bul@@ ance &quot; , said the bour@@ g@@ m@@ ate José Paul@@ et , des@@ cen@@ ded in the places .
The grand@@ father was on the floor during the boom .
S@@ ain and except , he was able to join the down@@ fall by the es@@ cor@@ t stay@@ ed intact while the re@@ ar wall of the house was totally destroyed .
The grand@@ father and the ten@@ ant of the neighb@@ or &apos;s house , fragile by the explo@@ sions , were rela@@ xed by the president of the CA@@ P@@ S .
Both An@@ ne and N@@ am@@ ur fire@@ men and the police of Ar@@ ches intervened .
The civil protection of Cris@@ n@@ é has stabili@@ zed both buildings .
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to lend .
Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si pre@@ ached the inaug@@ ur@@ ation station , but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt .
The Islamist Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si promised the emergence of a &quot; new Egypt &quot; when he pre@@ ached the inaug@@ ur@@ ation of the presidency , thereby becoming the first freely elected president and succe@@ eding in H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak who was hun@@ ted out of power 16 months earlier .
During his inaug@@ ur@@ ation in front of the constitutional court , Mr. Mor@@ si has also become the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ archy 60 years ago .
He pre@@ ached in front of the 18 judges in the black ro@@ ck of the Court whose building on the N@@ il &apos;s border was built to look like an Egyptian temp@@ le .
&quot; We want a better future , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , &quot; said President Mor@@ si during the formal ceremony broadcast directly on public television .
&quot; Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life - absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability &quot; , explained Mr. Mor@@ si , a 60 year-old engine@@ er formed in the United States , coming from the Muslim Bro@@ thers , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal organization and severely re@@ pressed by successive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Mor@@ si arrived soon after 11 hours , local hours , followed by a little con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acc@@ lam@@ ate the new president and , moving out of the presidency &apos;s presidential election of the years , the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his con@@ voy in the very busy streets linking the city city to the south sub@@ ur@@ bs .
Consid@@ ering like the little char@@ is@@ matic &quot; emergency wheel &quot; of the Muslim Bro@@ thers , his personal prestige has greatly strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak .
&quot; Egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state &quot; , said Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , in a blue and red ca@@ ve@@ at , addressed to the judges in the h@@ all@@ mark room of bo@@ is@@ eries where he pre@@ ached .
Lat@@ er , Mr. Mor@@ si went to the University of Cairo where he gave his inaug@@ ur@@ ation speech .
He was officially welcomed by a military fan@@ fare who played the national an@@ them when he was putting himself in the gar@@ den .
The ma@@ re@@ ch@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ ou@@ i attended the ceremony .
At his arrival , he was welcomed by the s@@ ister &quot; The people and the army , hand in hand ... &quot; en@@ vo@@ red by thousands of people assemb@@ led in the big hi@@ theat@@ re of university .
In 19@@ 08 and former str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of secular education , the Cairo university became later a str@@ anger of the Islamic student groups in the 1970 &apos;s .
Mr. Mor@@ si made a symbol@@ ism on Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r place , where the uprising that ended Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian regime last year , and v@@ owed to recover the presidential powers of which the military council , which replaced the former president , was de@@ ported , dispos@@ s@@ essed it .
But by agreeing to officially be in front of the Court , rather than in front of Parliament as it is used , he c@@ lic@@ ks in front of the army &apos;s will by showing that the fight for power is not over .
Mr Mor@@ si &apos;s speech about Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r &apos;s place accompanied dramatic populist actions .
The US sh@@ ut@@ down has hindered the increase in the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weigh@@ ed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October , show the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers , five of the six main ones having performance below expectations .
The three big De@@ tro@@ it manufacturers are showing a two-@@ figure growth compared to October 2012 but only General Mo@@ tors did better than expected .
The analy@@ sts anticipated on average 15@@ .@@ 4 million sales at an ann@@ u@@ alized pace and correc@@ ted seasonal variations but the market established at 15@@ .@@ 3 million according to the estimates of Adam J@@ on@@ as , the analy@@ st of Morgan Stan@@ ley .
In a note to the bank &apos;s clients , he thinks that this light shot is primarily explained by &quot; the government sh@@ ut@@ down and its impact on the feeling of the consumer in the first half of the month &quot; .
However , G@@ M has reported on the progress of almost 16 % of its sales last month at 2@@ 26 4@@ 02 vehicles , compared to 2@@ 11 5@@ 63 expected by the consensus .
The four bran@@ ds of the group have seen their commercial performance improved compared to October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit among others from the success of its p@@ ick@@ -@@ ups , has seen its sales increase by 14 % on one year to 19@@ 1 9@@ 85 vehicles , while the consensus was waiting for 19@@ 4 30@@ 1 .
For his part , Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ler , controlled by Fi@@ at announced a 11 % increase in his sales to 140 0@@ 83 vehicles , compared to 14@@ 3 5@@ 36 expected .
To@@ y@@ ot@@ a and N@@ iss@@ an also displayed lower sales than consensus , despite increases over a year of 8.@@ 8 % and 14@@ .@@ 2 % respectively .
At the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change , G@@ M action earned 1.@@ 4 % at 16@@ h@@ 35 G@@ M@@ T while Ford gave up 1.@@ 1 % .
Rena@@ ult pl@@ agu@@ ed on stock markets by N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s warning
Rena@@ ult acc@@ uses Friday of the strongest decrease in the S@@ B@@ F 120 index in Paris after its partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor announced having reduced his annual net profit forecast by almost 20 % , pay traders .
N@@ iss@@ an , who had to carry out such a revision , also announced a re@@ organisation of his direction .
Several traders reported that the Rena@@ ult action was affected this morning by &quot; War@@ ning &quot; .
&quot; This is clearly the wind@@ ow@@ -@@ gain of N@@ iss@@ an , &quot; says a bos@@ s responsible for a Par@@ is@@ ian bro@@ ther .
Under the Rena@@ ult alliance , Rena@@ ult holds 4@@ 3.@@ 4 % of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of French , according to data on N@@ iss@@ an website .
Greece : two deaths in a sho@@ oting near a local of the neo-@@ Nazi party
Two people were killed and another one was injured on Friday night by the fire fired by two people who were on board a motor@@ cycle who went to a local party in the ne@@ on@@ az@@ i . A@@ be in the west sub@@ ur@@ bs of Athens , they learned from police sources .
The police w@@ as@@ n &apos;t able to give information about the identity of the victims and their possible political belonging .
Some Greek media reported that some of Au@@ be golden members had argued that the victims were guards of their local people .
The injured person immediately was hosp@@ it@@ alized , according to the same source .
Police police officers dis@@ pat@@ ched on the Central aven@@ ue of the sub@@ ur@@ bs . Su@@ o Iraqi , where the incident took place and closed the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
The incident comes a few weeks after the indic@@ tment of six Au@@ be D@@ or@@ ry MPs , including the leader and foun@@ der of the party , to participate in &quot; a criminal organization &quot; in an attack against this party launched after the death of an anti-@@ fascist mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an by one of his members .
The call by Scot@@ t Brown rejected
Scot@@ t Brown , the cap@@ tain of C@@ el@@ ti@@ c G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w , saw his rejected call and will be well suspended for the next two matches of League Cha@@ mp@@ ions of his club , against A@@ j@@ a@@ x and A@@ C Mil@@ an .
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ ited against Bar@@ ç@@ a for having addressed Ney@@ mar , the Scottish environment has seen its suspension extended to three meetings by the U@@ EF@@ A .
In a communication , his club said &quot; very disappointed &quot; , believing that his call was entirely justified .
Almost 50 000 households are deprived of electricity on the whole province , shortly after noon Friday , due to violent win@@ ds affecting many regions along the Sain@@ t-@@ L@@ au@@ rent river .
The sectors most affected are the L@@ au@@ ren@@ tin with 15 0@@ 42 subscri@@ bers plun@@ ged in the dark , Le Mon@@ é@@ tr@@ é@@ e with 13 4@@ 64 and the Y@@ e@@ ou@@ ou@@ is with 8@@ 6@@ 42 .

Do you think that the travel agencies belong@@ ed to the past because of the internet ?
F@@ light center seems to reverse the trend .
The company has revised its net profit forecast up@@ wards and hopes for record results thanks to the ho@@ sts of Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit on the whole exercise of between $ 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 M before taxes , against a previous forecast of 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 M $ .
If current predic@@ tions are reached , it will represent 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record profit of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 M reached in 2011 / 12 .
The director General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ light C@@ lu@@ t had realized 8 % of profits in the first sem@@ ester and that the second sem@@ ester had started in force , especially with regard to travel other than business tri@@ ps in Australia and the United Kingdom .
&quot; Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are on the way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before deduc@@ ting interest and taxes , he said .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits .
In Australia , the rec@@ rea@@ tional travel sector has re@@ kin@@ d@@ led during the second sem@@ ester , which made it possible to compensate for a small domestic market for business tri@@ ps .
Similarly in the United Kingdom , the leisure travel sector of F@@ light C@@ enter has recorded good results while business customers have spent less .
His subsidiary in the United States has recovered his losses during the first sem@@ ester where the seasonal demand is lower and had to benefit from the whole exercise for the third time running .
The actions of F@@ light Centre have increased by 3 c@@ ents to reach $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
In@@ no@@ vations sho@@ ot a ho@@ tel near the py@@ ra@@ mid in Cairo
S@@ ho@@ o@@ ded str@@ ang@@ ers opened the fire this Friday on a ho@@ tel close to the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid in Egypt without being victims , the result of an apparent qu@@ arre@@ l with redundant employees .
The assa@@ il@@ ants took the flight , said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , the Police General Ab@@ del L@@ ative .
This attack comes when Egypt almost no longer receives any tourist since the army removed the Islamist president Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si in early July and re@@ pres@@ ses the protests of his supporters in the blood .
Scho@@ ol schools are encouraged to focus more on mathema@@ tics , spe@@ lling and g@@ ram@@ mar g@@ ram@@ mar
In the English literature classes , students will have to study at least a piece of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic po@@ em and a contemporary British fic@@ tion work of 19@@ 14 in our days .
The examination will also present &quot; new texts &quot; to encourage a more diversi@@ fied reading .
A mix of literature and English language will be deleted .
From 2015 , students will have to pass an independent language G@@ C@@ SE , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualifications in English literature .
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and male programs tomorrow - the first materials to undergo a radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental materials next year .
On the other hand , Op@@ qu@@ al , the Office of the Super@@ vis@@ or of exam@@ inations , will reveal a re@@ organisation of the structure of the G@@ C@@ SE , with a new rating system and less classes .
Speaking during the summer , Mic@@ hael Go@@ ve , Minister of Education , said that there was a &quot; broad consensus about the need to reform our system of exam@@ s to restore public confidence &quot; , insisting that the G@@ C@@ SE would be &quot; more stimulating , more ambitious and more rigorous &quot; .
Stu@@ dies show that English schools spend less time at the me@@ als ( 1@@ 16 hours per year , 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
By comparison , Austr@@ ali@@ an schools offer on average 14@@ 3 hours per year , and the students of Singapore make about 13@@ 8 hours .
While there is no formal obligation to spend more hours of time working to the m@@ th@@ s , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the G@@ C@@ SE of deep me@@ als – as well as the greater importance given to the materials in international ran@@ kings – would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours of classes .
The program will put more emphasis on the &quot; real world problems &quot; , especially financial mathema@@ tics .
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in this state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .

The ex-@@ head of the G@@ est@@ ap@@ o buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery
M@@ ü@@ ller , who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace , was actually buried in a common mass of Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in Berlin , says the leader of the M@@ em@@ orial of the German resistance , Professor Joh@@ han@@ nes T@@ uch@@ el , in Bil@@ d .
M@@ ü@@ ller did not survive at the end of the war .
&quot; His body was buried in 19@@ 45 in a common fo@@ d@@ der of the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery of Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Mit@@ te , he assured every day of a lot of rage based on archi@@ ves documents .
This re@@ vel@@ ation , 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , would answer one of the great en@@ ig@@ ma of the post-@@ war war .
The German secret services , the B@@ N@@ D , assured that during the summer of 19@@ 49 , M@@ ü@@ ller was at Kar@@ lo@@ v@@ y V@@ y , then in Cz@@ echo@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ akia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
The secret services were completely wrong .
&quot; From August 19@@ 45 , M@@ ü@@ ller &apos;s body was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the As@@ k of the Re@@ ich by a command &quot; , according to Mr. T@@ uch@@ el .
He had &quot; a uniform of general &quot; .
&quot; In the left internal poc@@ ket , in particular , there were its service states with a pho@@ to &quot; , he continued .
Bil@@ d also publ@@ ishes a document from the district town town town of Mit@@ te in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
The president of the central council of the Jews of Germany , Di@@ e@@ ter G@@ au@@ mann , declared himself shocked by this re@@ vel@@ ation .
That one of the most brutal Nazi sad@@ ists is buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery , it &apos;s an enorm@@ ity of bad taste .

D@@ r Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le dis@@ regards free healthcare in Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos;s villages
D@@ r B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his team spend almost all their week@@ ends
There are not many doctors in this country of West Africa , barely 1 for 5 000 inhabitants .
Vo@@ te here or via your mobile de@@ vice
D@@ r Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le is one of 10 C@@ N@@ N C@@ N@@ N from the year 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the 10 other her@@ oes , to elect &quot; H@@ ey C@@ N@@ N of the year &quot; .
This person will receive $ 25@@ ,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le watched her sick father alter@@ n@@ ating periods of conscience and conscience and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help her .
James B@@ w@@ on was injured in a car accident in 198@@ 1 near Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ é , the capital of Cam@@ ero@@ on .
At first , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted a infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ em@@ at@@ om@@ e he was going to wear the sequ@@ el of his life .
&quot; There were no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in Cam@@ ero@@ on &quot; , said Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money .
Instead , D@@ r B@@ w@@ le spent years supporting his father in crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , so he can get any treatment he could enjoy .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy , &quot; adds Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
You can leave the house at 5 : 00 , go to the hospital to be the first one , and you &apos;@@ re not the first .
There are a lot of patients .
People can die because they wait too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of D@@ r B@@ w@@ le &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
And even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ on could not pay the consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty threshold , and almost three quarters of the country &apos;s health expenses are carried out in the private sector .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; explained D@@ r B@@ w@@ le .
And because of poverty , they can &apos;t enjoy life .
After seeing his father and as many of his comp@@ at@@ riots suffer , D@@ r B@@ w@@ le was determined to try to change the course of things .
D@@ r . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his team of volunteers practic@@ ed more than 700 sur@@ gical acts free during the course of last year .
He became a doctor himself , working like a v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar sur@@ ge@@ on at the central hospital in Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ é .
And he created a non-@@ profit humanitarian association , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ E , which goes to rural areas during week@@ ends to dispen@@ se free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped almost 32 000 people .
Almost every Friday , with a 30 people , they go into pe@@ p@@ ples after setting medical equipment on the ro@@ of and going through difficult land to go to the villages that need help most .
The chance doesn &apos;t always follow them .
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or empty ways .
But when they arrive , they are received in her@@ oes : the community organize a party , ch@@ ick and d@@ ance and offer them the best available housing .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and D@@ r B@@ w@@ el@@ le - with his great s@@ mile and his un@@ brid@@ led energy - is more than happy to join the cele@@ bra@@ tions .
The next morning , the team starts receiving hundreds of patients .
&quot; We get 500 people on every visit &quot; , said Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
They sometimes live at 60 km from the village , and they come to foot .
In this roaming hospital , various health care is prof@@ essed .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can get b@@ alls , a pool of gl@@ asses collected or a free birth certificate - a necessary document to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
The evening , the practical team practical sur@@ gical acts under local an@@ a@@ es@@ thetic .
The operations are usually carried out in a school , a town town or a house ; after the intervention , the patient rises and goes to the aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the elec@@ tro@@ gen group , the operation room and the ster@@ ili@@ zation of equipment , D@@ r B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
It &apos;s an e@@ ternal r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , but village mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans usually help the team to stay motivated .
&quot; They kno@@ ck on stam@@ ps every night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work &quot; , explained Mr. B@@ w@@ le .
On Sunday , the team returns to city , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , composed of Cam@@ ero@@ on doctors and medical students , practic@@ ed 700 sur@@ gical acts free during the course of last year , and he knows that their presence can make the difference for those who they come to help .
A man explained that the free operation he had su@@ ed to treat a grass would allow him to work again .
&quot; This will change my future and that of my family &quot; , said man .
In addition to making this roaming hospital live and working like sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , D@@ r B@@ w@@ el@@ le also works at night in private medical firms around Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ é .
It &apos;s this second job , explain , who finances 60 % of his association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; I don &apos;t know when he sle@@ ep@@ s &quot; , said K@@ are@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a medical student in the second year of the University D@@ re@@ x@@ el in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a and volunte@@ er within the D@@ r B@@ w@@ le group .
He is still at the hospital or is trying to find money for his association so he can lead these campaigns .
For students in medicine and nurses like K@@ ace . O@@ ld , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le in his missions , it &apos;s an opportunity to learn on the ground that they don &apos;t have at home .
&quot; We &apos;@@ ve been able to participate in operations to help solve blood or pass the instruments to D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le , &quot; explained M@@ iss O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a student in medicine in the second year .
Volun@@ tary students usually pay their trip to Cam@@ ero@@ on , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
But once in Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ é , their pension , transportation and education are taken care of by Do@@ c@@ tor B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
&quot; It &apos;s a her@@ o , there &apos;s no doubt &quot; , said K@@ are@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the Cam@@ ero@@ on people is not close to dying .
For D@@ r B@@ w@@ le , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ p the others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m so happy when I do this work &quot; , added Mr. B@@ w@@ le .
And I &apos;@@ m thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I &apos;@@ m doing .
Ma@@ ke people lau@@ gh and ease pain are the reasons that lead me to do that .

No doubt , but by under@@ scor@@ ing its weak for the paths of going through , S@@ ci@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , U@@ p@@ per E@@ u@@ x .
Ar@@ ound the works of others in his office in the street G@@ as@@ ton@@ -@@ G@@ alli@@ mar@@ d ?
Indeed , but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the ed@@ itor .
Ser@@ it@@ er of the cra@@ zy that occupied the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my .
Of course , still , but knowing that such a sac@@ red can &apos;t replace real ho@@ ly oil , that of the thesis , which happened .
They have will@@ ingly recognized in him a great awa@@ ke , anim@@ ator and feder@@ ator of their work , but by pointing out that he was unlikely to produce himself .
To this uncertain image , the monu@@ ment of the &quot; Free memory &quot; , to which he attached his name , has also contributed .
The bad languages have been able to see a huge market for chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with a vi@@ br@@ ant eye and le@@ u@@ di@@ tion .
The two books published by Nor@@ a soon two years ago already established that the person who went to not writing had a lot and well written .
The book that this should bring to her definitively justice .
Yet we find , once again , the temptation of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , the intellectual v@@ ag@@ ging , the ju@@ bil@@ ation to be j@@ am@@ med up as with one subject on the other .
But we quickly understand that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the br@@ ush to a single passion : the one to discover the no@@ d constituent of French identity .
Why these dramatic calls for national unity ?
I@@ d@@ entity : it &apos;s a concern of time .
We were collectively invited to give a definition .
But in the per@@ va@@ sive spirit of our leaders then , the French identity was a int@@ em@@ per@@ ous essence .
We only needed to deploy accidents , and the affair , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism forces , was given to the pre@@ fec@@ ts and the sub@@ pre@@ ts , authorised interpreters .
That &apos;s what Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a is all about .
He doesn &apos;t ask himself the he@@ ir of e@@ ternal fran@@ c@@ ism , he refuses to define it .
An@@ aly@@ st worries about a familiar str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he is in a forest of symbols , stopped every step by an object in the form of re@@ bus , tor@@ mented by irrit@@ ating questions .
This one , which is born of the company itself : why , in a country that is so long inst@@ alled in its borders , if formerly char@@ ge@@ sted and as@@ c@@ end@@ ant , what are these dramatic calls for unity ?
They are so pressing , suggest Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , than to con@@ j@@ ure up the trouble born by the dis@@ cor@@ d of French history .
Fran@@ cs and Gaul@@ laws , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ac@@ s and Bour@@ gu@@ ign@@ ons , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the division forces here are very old .
And the most emb@@ le@@ matic is obviously the one that ends up in two national history .
From the se@@ ism of the revolution , the French have two stories and they have two nations , a mon@@ arch@@ ic , the other revolutionary .
The second one wanted the death of the first one , but without succe@@ eding to deny it ; worries on the contrary to find the stup@@ idity and all the more gre@@ edy of unity and indi@@ visibility that she had cut off the head of the person who was the obvious and powerful inc@@ ar@@ nation .
And , from there , a nation inv@@ inci@@ bly bin@@ ary , shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , love and hatred of the revolution .
To make the uni@@ qu@@ eness of French identity feel , nothing is worth the four not out of the H@@ exagger@@ one , so the American st@@ ap@@ of by Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a could be the heart of his book .
Because America and France have one and the other made a revolution , written a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
But the American c@@ ous@@ ing is only better to highlight what is our own .
There , men who left their An@@ ci@@ en Reg@@ ime in England and no longer had to worry about it .
Here , crow@@ ded men from an indigenous An@@ cient region , and even more radical .
Here is a consensu@@ al revolution when she s@@ owed drama and trust .
Here , the founding fathers who are still hon@@ ored , and here revolutionary anc@@ estors whose models are barely worth doing , and who have always killed themselves .
Here , institutional consistency , and here a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitution , as many mistakes to be made and tests to resume .
France that &apos;s going , France that comes
However , there was a time when the French thought they could rec@@ ou@@ p the ro@@ tten ro@@ bo@@ t of their history , and defeat the cur@@ se of the two .
At this Third Republic , the central and creat@@ or moment , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a has shown a lot of interest and even ten@@ ure : sal@@ ving those who then worked to repair the revolutionary f@@ rac@@ ture , teaching to the school@@ children everything in the old France was clearly preparing modern France and proposing a unified version of their history .
But this peaceful identity had only a time .
This is once again in debate , blocked by immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of res@@ on@@ ative minorities , absor@@ bed in the European space .
The book therefore offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ it of France that &apos;s going on and the circum@@ stance of France that comes from .
With a premium , the portra@@ it of the histor@@ ian , which should reserve a few sur@@ prises .
We &apos;@@ ll discover that the railway worker was a ca@@ ke .
The man of multiple cu@@ o@@ si@@ ties turns , slightly obs@@ es@@ sively , around the same idea .
The man@@ ure of read@@ ers was at the center of the center .
And the one who had tabled , for more than a half-@@ century , a subject on the idea of nation , but had taken away the initial exercise of the thesis , we &apos;@@ re entr@@ u@@ sting ourselves , cu@@ m gr@@ ano s@@ al@@ s , that it will have ended up being done .
Of course , in a less mature , more broken and sub@@ tle form .
But let &apos;s not dec@@ eive ourselves , just as binding .
Because much more than the figure imposed of university curricul@@ a , this afternoon says the domestic necessity of a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &quot; Re@@ turn is pretty complex to manage &quot;
En@@ d in Be@@ ir@@ ut on March 8 , 1986 with three members of his &quot; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 team &quot; who came to film a demonstration from Hezbollah , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released almost 21 months later , on 27 November 198@@ 7 .
Re@@ treaty since 2008 , in 2004 , he participated in the creation of the hostages &apos; defence association &quot; World Scho@@ ol &quot; , which he presid@@ ed over for several years .
His main objective : to obtain the possibility for hostages to file a complaint and to bring their hostage ta@@ kers to the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages of A@@ q@@ m@@ i ( Al@@ -@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a in the Islamic Maghreb ) Dan@@ i@@ el L@@ arri@@ be , Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry D@@ ol , Pi@@ er@@ re Le@@ ga and Mar@@ c F@@ ér@@ et were released on Tuesday .
After medical exam@@ inations at the V@@ al-@@ de-@@ Thanks military hospital on Wednesday afternoon , they could have found their families since then .
And try , soon , to resume the course of their lives .
&quot; The New Year Ob@@ ser@@ ver &quot; questioned Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din , 62 years old , ex big re@@ porter , re@@ treated since 2008 , the president of the &quot; World Law &quot; association .
From the evening of your release , you were on the 20@@ h of &quot; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &quot; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
Especially in Be@@ ir@@ ut .
When I &apos;@@ m free , I find myself in the co@@ ff@@ er of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it &apos;s black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ que .
He told me &quot; we &apos;@@ re released &quot; , but I &apos;@@ m not sure , and tell me that we can still be killed .
We &apos;@@ re very exc@@ ited , but very tense too .
It &apos;s war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They ask us on the edge of a side@@ walk .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then we arrive at the site of the Sum@@ er@@ land ho@@ tel where the press is present .
French people bring us to the emb@@ ass@@ y of France .
It &apos;s time for the first wi@@ rel@@ s to parents , family , friends , press ...
I remember I took a b@@ ath for an hour .
And having din@@ ner in t-@@ shir@@ t at the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
I also remember a short night discussing with Ro@@ ger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
The tension is still there because we have no means to evac@@ u@@ ate ourselves to L@@ ar@@ n@@ ac@@ a Air@@ port in Cyprus .
Ar@@ ri@@ ved there in hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ en@@ z@@ ara , where P@@ as@@ a bo@@ asts .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
We &apos;@@ re getting to Or@@ ly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
It &apos;s a bit brutal .
There is an incredible shop .
And a lot of media .
When I left there were three TV channels .
I come back and there are plenty .
The des@@ cent from the plane sto@@ cking , the re@@ union with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely strong in emotion .
Between the airport and my home , many motor@@ cycles follow our car that R@@ am@@ h@@ out@@ e leads .
The moder@@ ators get out of the poc@@ ket to make photo@@ s and follow me up to home where I have to do the police a bit to prevent some of them .
The media pressure is huge .
It doesn &apos;t stop , we are well placed to know it ...
But the state of emotion and fa@@ ti@@ gue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly .
We get out of a hole and we suddenly have media fires .
It &apos;s a bit complicated , a bit violent , rather complex to manage .
But we did the hardest .
At the same time , I &apos;@@ m at 20@@ h , the next day , I &apos;@@ m on TV .
Then start a kind of re@@ alignment to life , very slowly , for one or two months that are a bit like vac@@ ations .
How did medical exam@@ s and the D@@ G@@ SE deal ?
I had the right to first medical control in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The rest was done in the V@@ al-@@ de-@@ thanks the following days my return : radio , all gender tests and meet with a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It &apos;s not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him , to remind him if necessary , that we are not delivered to ourselves .
It is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostage ta@@ kers .
It was logical .
It did not anno@@ y me .
How do you react , today , to the release of the four hostages of Ni@@ ger ?
I listen to what is said .
The debate about ran@@ ges in particular .
Some things anno@@ y me , others less .
I &apos;@@ m trying to do the part between the questions on my past as a hostage and my cas@@ qu@@ et@@ te of the president of the &quot; Op@@ en World &quot; association that allows me to distance myself , and seems much more interesting to talk about .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Especially , I &apos;@@ m fighting , with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostage .
I think there is a problem with sem@@ an@@ tics .
We must call the taking hostage hostage taking &quot; political &quot; - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice , to file a complaint and to bring their hostage ta@@ kers to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in comp@@ as@@ sion , in the emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages could perhaps also have access to justice ?
A tribunal in The Hague is done for that .
Why do you not tell the hostage ta@@ kers &quot; you have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of the war , like those of all the Geneva conventions , we &apos;@@ ll be brought to justice &quot; ?
It seems to me , however , that it is justified , legitimate , strikes common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and that shocked me .
It &apos;s my main fight .
Egypt &apos;s Islamists in the street
The anger is growing in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists .
Two days before the opening of the trial of the de@@ ed president Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
mobilisation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country .
It &apos;s not a trial highlights this milit@@ ant Muslim milit@@ ant .
Until now , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunte@@ er could take a copy of the documents &apos; documents .
It &apos;s not a trial , it &apos;s a jo@@ ke .
The trial of President Mor@@ si is a false trial . A pro-@@ Mor@@ si . He &apos;s supposed to be judging S@@ is@@ i , not the opposite .
Mor@@ si must judge S@@ is@@ i for massacres in R@@ ab@@ a , the massacres of N@@ ah@@ da , and the massacre of the Republican Gu@@ ard .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
clashes broke out in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police used te@@ ar gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police ac@@ ade@@ my , where will be judged Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si .
H@@ ag@@ el blam@@ es 9 American states to violate homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognised sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage , &quot; all the military partners are entitled to an identity card of the Defense department and to the benefits that come with &quot; , reminded the minister in New York in a speech in front of the Anti-@@ D@@ ef@@ am@@ ation League .
&quot; But some states refuse to issue these cards to sa@@ me-@@ sex couples in the National Gu@@ ard installations &quot; established on their territory , he denounced , blam@@ ing these states to violate the federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , these people can &apos;t benefit from the many social or health services provided on these bases , or access their sto@@ res .
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the leader of the National Gu@@ ard , General Fr@@ ank Gr@@ ass , to make sure of the implementation of the federal law .
The front of the nine states started by the T@@ ex@@ as who refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the National Gu@@ ard .
It was joined in its refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ ppi , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Car@@ ol@@ ine and western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defence officer .
The Pen@@ tag@@ on considers the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to about 5@@ 600 active people , 17 000 by including the National Gu@@ ard , the reserve and the reti@@ rees .
Six edi@@ tion of the P@@ lay Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard this Saturday in Hy@@ è@@ res
The sixth edi@@ tion of the P@@ lay Sk@@ work@@ ard takes place this Saturday , 2 November at the sk@@ ate par@@ k in Hy@@ è@@ res .
Organ@@ ized by the S@@ K@@ 8 Un@@ ity section of the Bu@@ m@@ p association , the competition should bring together the best sk@@ ators in the region .
The en@@ rol@@ ls are taken on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification stages will start at 10 : 00 , before the end scheduled for 3 hours and the award of prices at 4 hours .
The public will be able to ad@@ mire the technical pro@@ w@@ ess of young people who , for some , are already familiar with competi@@ tions at the highest level , like the young hy@@ ero@@ is prof@@ essor L@@ or@@ en@@ z@@ o P@@ lu@@ m@@ bo .
Just 10 years , he has already conqu@@ ered his place this year for the European cham@@ pion@@ ships in Copenhagen and he doesn &apos;t like anything while going back to competitors who exceed three heads .
The may@@ or of Tor@@ onto is hunting journalists who came to ask him about a drug affair
In Canada , the may@@ or of Tor@@ onto is suspected of getting involved , according to several media .
A video restoration of justice seems to support these suspic@@ ions .
The interested person , Ro@@ b Ford , has always denied having consumed a cr@@ ack , while recognising having a pen@@ sion@@ er for can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
This Thursday , he hun@@ ted out his property several journalists who came to ask him .
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment .
A case of rage detected at a c@@ at in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a rage case had been detected at a ch@@ at@@ on in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise , obviously of foreign origin while France is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed of native cases since 2001 .
The ch@@ at@@ on was found on 25 October in Ar@@ g@@ en@@ eu@@ il and he died on 28 October .
The rage diagnosis has been confirmed by the P@@ ast@@ er Institute .
&quot; An epidemic investigation has been launched to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this ch@@ at@@ on between 8 October and 28 October including , &quot; specifies the departments of health and agriculture .
&quot; Five people who have been in contact with the ch@@ at@@ on have already been identified &quot; and received preventive treatment .
&quot; C@@ ome on man , the preventive treatment of human rage , administered after contact with the port@@ er animal , but before the appearance of symptoms , is very effective &quot; , specifies the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The departments now call people who would have been mor@@ tal , gri@@ pped , gre@@ eted , or l@@ acked on a mu@@ d or on a skin damaged by this ch@@ at@@ on or whose animal would have been in contact with this ch@@ at@@ on between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0@@ 8@@ ,@@ 1@@ 1@@ ,@@ 00@@ .@@ 00@@ .@@ 0@@ 6@@ .@@ 95 between 10 hours and 6 hours from 1 November .
&quot; France has been sc@@ ary of rage since 2001 , this ch@@ at@@ on or the mother have been imported from another country , not un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed &quot; according to the release .
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last &quot; native &quot; of rage recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fo@@ x and that &quot; France is officially declared un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Animal Health ( O@@ I@@ E ) &quot; .
A case of rage on an illegally imported chic@@ ken from G@@ am@@ bia was recorded in 2008 .
&quot; rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time &quot; , remind the departments and it can be transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease .
Obama goes back on his reform of the health system
During an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama came back yesterday on his un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable and often repeated promise that &quot; if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it &quot; .
After hundreds of thousands of people have received opinions from their providers , the Republic@@ ans have criticized the president in the last few days by acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
&quot; The vast majority of people holding a health insurance who suits them can keep it &quot; , he said during a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
Tal@@ king about what he calls &quot; a cr@@ umbling in the news &quot; about the termin@@ ations , President Obama has pushed the Americans who received these opinions to look for a new insurance on the market .
Most people will be able to get full and better adapted health schemes for the same price , or even for even cheaper than expected .
&quot; You will come out &quot; , he said .
The Administration has announced that we should not be surprised if the 5 % of the population who themselves take their insurance found themselves forced to change diet because their coverage does not satisfy the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act .
&quot; Let me address these Americans directly : you deserve better &quot; , said K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us during his testi@@ mony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who over@@ sees the implementation of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act , said that the launch in October of the online market failed &quot; la@@ ment@@ ably &quot; .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m as frustrated and anno@@ yed as anyone &quot; , she added .
I &apos;@@ m anxious to recover your confidence .
It &apos;s a K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us ex@@ as@@ per@@ é who pronounced this sentence , even though she believed her micro@@ phone cut off , speaking to an assist@@ ant sitting behind her during the session of the Assembly yesterday following an exchange of li@@ tig@@ ation with Bil@@ ly L@@ ong , a Republican representative of the M@@ iss@@ our@@ i , to know if she should join the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
For more than three hours , Bil@@ ly L@@ ong repeatedly asked Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us why &quot; the architec@@ t &quot; of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act did not voluntarily give up the insurance sponsored by the government to subscribe to a regime via He@@ al@@ th@@ Car@@ .@@ go@@ v , that it now pra@@ ises millions of Americans .

The happy elected , J@@ a@@ ke V@@ te Pre@@ ko@@ p , combined the col@@ ors of the car brand and the German flag , while including the no@@ tions of speed and heat at the level of the run@@ way .
The German Se@@ bas@@ ti@@ an Ve@@ tel , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ ple champion of the world of For@@ mul@@ a 1 , é@@ n@@ é@@ n@@ é for free tests of the Gr@@ and Pri@@ x of Abu D@@ hab@@ i Friday a special ca@@ ke whose drawing was made by a Mexican f@@ an of 21 years .
Ve@@ tel has chosen among 1@@ ,@@ 500 draw@@ ings en@@ vo@@ red from all over the world , within the framework of a competition launched by one of the spons@@ ors , a car brand , of its stable .
He was invited to follow the G@@ P of Abu D@@ hab@@ i , with a friend , and can therefore look closely at the German champion , on the path and in his s@@ n@@ ade .
You should wear this c@@ able on Friday and Saturday , the tests .
He is likely to have another special job Sunday , for the race , to mark his 4@@ th con@@ spir@@ acy global title .
A inhabit@@ ant of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ la@@ v@@ s laun@@ ches his party on the sub@@ ur@@ bs
Let &apos;s not be mistaken .
In the spirit of Ab@@ d@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , his foun@@ der , the &quot; Party of the sub@@ ur@@ bs &quot; is not only addressed to b@@ ann@@ ers .
I chose a map of France as a lo@@ go , justify it .
When I talk about sub@@ ur@@ bs , I address all those who are excluded from the big national family .
However , his project , presented on Thursday in the press conference in his native of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ la@@ v@@ s , was born of the will to better defend multicul@@ tur@@ alism , this great cultural po@@ t that character@@ izes above all neigh@@ bor@@ hoods .
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multicul@@ tur@@ alism , he says .
Ab@@ d@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , 50 years old , a territorial att@@ ach@@ é , claims himself today as &quot; 100 % a@@ political &quot; even if it has not always been neutral .
Mi@@ xed in 2002 alongside Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ en@@ ement , he then supported locally Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in between 2010 and 2011 .
I know that the equality values I advocate in my program are linked to the left but if the right wing people are ready to support me , I will also listen to them , he will continue .
There are only extremist parties that I &apos;@@ m not talking about .
In addition to multicul@@ tur@@ alism , Ab@@ d@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine has built his program -@@ consul@@ table on Inter@@ net@@ - from many topics that are supposed to talk to sub@@ ur@@ bs and especially young people : the right to vote for foreigners , the leg@@ alization of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , the civil majority at 16 years , the rehabilitation of the function of the building guards .
We still need to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene &quot; .@@ For the 2014 municipal elections , it might be fair , he does . &quot;
It &apos;s a problem of time and money .
The sub@@ ur@@ bs Party should still be represented in Au@@ ber@@ vil@@ les through my application and I also hope in other cities .
Ab@@ d@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine ensures already seven heads of list in me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an France and in Mar@@ tine .
&quot; And the gu@@ ys of support I &apos;@@ ve received since yesterday don &apos;t come from sub@@ ur@@ bs . &quot; he rejo@@ ices .
John Ker@@ ry admitted , unprecedented , that American es@@ pion@@ age &quot; had gone too far . &quot;
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a weakening of the United States &apos; defen@@ sive attitude to his surveillance programs by ad@@ mitting , unprecedented , that on several occasions , the sp@@ ying &quot; had gone too far in an inappropriate way &quot; .
Secretary of State also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , governed on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations of the whis@@ tle@@ b@@ ast@@ er Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about the N@@ SA sp@@ ying activities saw the day .
The lea@@ ks put the American government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video connection , Ker@@ ry said : &quot; It &apos;s undeniable that the President , myself and other members of the government have taken on some things as an automatic pilot because we had the possibility , from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the cold war , then of course on 11 September . &quot;
He then became the first high-@@ ranking member of the United States government to admit that American es@@ pion@@ age had sur@@ passed the sh@@ it , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : &quot; In some cases , it went too far . &quot;
And the President is determined to try and clarify and clearly specify to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &quot; We live in a new world where people are ready to get caught . &quot;
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill people , explo@@ de them and attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they act ?
We did prevent planes from falling , explo@@ ding buildings and people to be killed because we were able to learn about the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , American legislators will be visiting Europe to answer the concerns about the alleged American es@@ pion@@ age affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States , explained on Thursday the president of the Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y from Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut indicated that he had expressed himself in front of the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the feeling of frustration that the monitoring of the National Security Agency raises .
&quot; It &apos;s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay on our side in the mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism &quot; , said Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first term , and president of the Sub@@ committee on European Senate of the American Senate , during an interview from Washington .
And I &apos;@@ ll go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight against terrorism , despite the anger caused by the N@@ SA programs .
The press reports that the N@@ SA has cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which has hurt relations with certain allies of the United States , however the director of the agency said this week that it was not accurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned meta@@ data that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations have reported documents released by S@@ now@@ den according to which the N@@ SA had inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state .
The director of intelligence services , James C@@ l@@ ap@@ er , justified the es@@ pion@@ age of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice on both sides .
In this atmosphere of tu@@ mul@@ t , Mur@@ ph@@ y indicated that his office was organising a cong@@ ress of Congress , which should take place this year , and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be un@@ ve@@ iled in the coming days .
He said that the route was to be defined .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the goal of this trip was to help improve relations , but also to be &quot; tough firm@@ ness &quot; .
He explained that European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of sp@@ ying programs they themselves have been applying for years .
&quot; We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only people in the world to do sp@@ ying , &quot; said Mur@@ ph@@ y .
Meanwhile , Mr Ker@@ ry has planned to go this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m generated by American strategies in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as by US surveillance activities .
The London stock market ended on Thursday , pl@@ agu@@ ed by the bad results of S@@ hell and after an announcement by the Fed to maintain its support for the economy , as planned .
An Austr@@ ali@@ an calls for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21 year-old Sy@@ d@@ ney gir@@ l , sentenced to 15 days of imprisonment in P@@ hu@@ k@@ let for wrongly claiming to have been assa@@ ul@@ ted by a tax@@ i driver , appe@@ aled to the judgment and was given freedom under deposit .
Ste@@ life Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first judged guilty by a Court of Pro@@ v@@ ince of P@@ hu@@ k@@ let on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thailand police that a local tax@@ i driver , accompanied by two other men who control him , attacked him early on Sunday , 10 June .
However , vide@@ o@@ surveillance recording later revealed that she was returned to her ho@@ tel safe after being separated from her little southern friend .
P@@ hu@@ k@@ let police questioned B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she admitted having invented the story of all parts .
She was held in a cell of the local office in advance of the hearing in court .

Tun@@ ks told the Sunday Te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h of Sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about the well-being of his gir@@ l and wanted her to go back to Australia .
&quot; We obviously lived a while anxious , but we hope to bring it back to the house safe as soon as possible &quot; , said Tun@@ ks .
B@@ am@@ ford called the judgment and was put in freedom after the payment of a 50 000 ba@@ h@@ ers .
