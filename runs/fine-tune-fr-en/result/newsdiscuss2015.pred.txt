U@@ K@@ IP &apos;s people who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example .
You talk about when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism , and when , with that in mind , he responds yes when the inter@@ views ask him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted .
First of all you use speci@@ ous arguments , and then dis@@ credit you with barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Every time I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we have to do the qu@@ e@@ ue behind the inc@@ is@@ i@@ ve chron@@ ic@@ on@@ ship that thinks that all is due .
I think it &apos;s you who use speci@@ ous arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the lef@@ ti@@ sts on the right , does not exist practically .
I think that is what we call democracy .
So no one would be affected by the U@@ K@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
There is only in the parallel uni@@ verse of U@@ K@@ IP that Car@@ sw@@ ell can appear like a revolutionary .
A quot@@ ation from a tor@@ ch@@ on is by proof .
Yes , therefore , take the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail di@@ dn &apos;t write the report , it did only comment on it .
Those who control the majority of media in this country should be shot for having spread such populist propaganda as if it were reality .
I don &apos;t think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You don &apos;t know anything about my personal situation or my identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
The Far@@ age sentence was very surprised , but only because we rarely talk about this problem .
He made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic comment .
You &apos;@@ ll have to get back to you .
I &apos;@@ m not sure where you want to come , but I imagine you don &apos;t like when the media talk about what you don &apos;t like .
We &apos;@@ re talking about it so rarely because unlike Far@@ age and his under@@ privileged follow@@ ers of That@@ cher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own failure to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are something good , then no .
Finally , the situation is as ro@@ tten in Ireland as in Spain .
With the new crisis that happens the austerity period will not have arranged anything .
Se@@ tting almost 5 % growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
In Ireland , the &quot; T@@ I@@ G@@ R@@ E DE &quot; The EU@@ R@@ O@@ P@@ E is telling us , there are a few ann@@ u@@ als .
We knew the rest !
This recommended reading the article .
We &apos;@@ re trying to make sure that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that a &quot; N@@ O@@ U@@ V@@ U@@ U@@ E &quot; M@@ IR@@ AC@@ E CO@@ O@@ M@@ IC@@ E is happening .
With the Brussels agreement , im@@ po@@ tent on the lowest social society in Europe , a flexible work work , an ongoing integration .
With these insi@@ ghts , not what &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
In the 8@@ 0s of the 20th si@@ r , the ir@@ k was one of the poorest countries of the Euro-@@ op@@ en@@ e union , with the Portuguese , considering a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without the new@@ est countries , the situation is always better than it was .
The Gre@@ y was in front .
That their development is not a long calm river , it &apos;s on the recent news .
Europe &apos;s lowest im@@ po@@ ts ?
It &apos;s false !
Latvia has a 0 % rate of im@@ po@@ ts on companies .
Now there is a hypocrisy in France from the policies on the im@@ po@@ ts paid by the multinationals .
If one thinks of a report that came out in 2008 or 2009 , they pay in France less than 5 % in gen@@ al .
Only SMEs pay a lot .
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become an en@@ or@@ me , and there are new cars ( and he@@ re ) all of the street cor@@ ners , exactly as before the 2008 crisis .
I lived in Dublin for 14 years , the recovery is evident in daily jobs since the entr@@ ance .
Is it supposed to be economic news ?
D@@ on &apos;t worry , I &apos;@@ m sure the comments will soon so@@ ar .
In another article that they are writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ ha@@ l A@@ stra@@ a is involved in a c@@ up on the A@@ 140 .
Does R@@ y@@ an@@ air now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way ?
I think that Mr O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft , so a few bo@@ gs and wi@@ ves on the old ones will soon be forgotten .
Having said that , I ste@@ al with him next week , so I hope that it will not be on one of these young people once they are caught .
So it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot .
Did R@@ y@@ an@@ air make the passengers pay for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them ?
But without this kind of Irish companies , you could not afford to leave on vac@@ ations .
I never took R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the last 3 times I took the plane was with B@@ A .
I prefer when the airline offers quality service .
No , but it &apos;s R@@ y@@ an@@ air , so they can give it to my joy .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air triggered dozens of comments from people who would never take R@@ y@@ an@@ air at the place of those who like to take R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay something other than the basic fee have only to blame themselves , etc .
It &apos;s quite transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air won &apos;t be happy with the additional costs due to this incident .
I wonder what will be the delays and if we &apos;@@ ll have to compensate passengers and , if it &apos;s the case , if R@@ y@@ an@@ air will avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers in the airport .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers have been put in another plane in less than an hour , they have no right to compensation .
S@@ or@@ ry to dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to this British Air@@ ways flight that takes the English SIS in Syria , not true as you say .
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris , the street of the Fran@@ c@@ s@@ s@@ s@@ our@@ co@@ is : the Mar@@ a@@ is is largely pedestri@@ an , and almost everyone in the world .
People don &apos;t come en m@@ asse for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( for the most part ) or for Le Sal@@ on of the review in the area of B@@ lan@@ c@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ tes ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly d@@ ust ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the sto@@ res are all open and that the neigh@@ bor@@ hood is un@@ believ@@ ably alive and lively .
With many foreigners who spend ...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs ?
C@@ ome on to Paris .
@ al@@ o@@ es !
The only argument that seems admissible to me is that of zones receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they buy in tax .
The tourist areas lose a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons .
There remains the industry where expensive equipment , exploited on the Sunday , can lower prices .
Sunday rest is a right that the employees enjoy except exceptions .
That &apos;s why it is planned and regulated by the labor code .
Neither the minister responsible for the economy nor , from the rest , the one responsible for foreign affairs , has the slightest competence to reform the labor code .
So if they finish it .
The law serves what ?
To satisfy a portion of the population and companies that want to work on the Sunday .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al Sunday ap@@ ps my little ki@@ ds to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my V@@ ille of 30@@ ,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal bi@@ ke is open 4 days per week but not the w@@ e !
That &apos;s access to culture ...
And it &apos;s also the regulation of working time .
the lifestyle he defended with ten@@ acity against fascism
the lifestyle he defended with ten@@ acity against fascism and Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ism
And if the succession of his daughter was , against her will , used to pay for the inher@@ it@@ ance fees ?
There are pain@@ ts .
Some are good , others not terrible .
No doubt his sequ@@ el would like his part of the ca@@ ke , if you pass the expression .
His preference for a victory for nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and add his well known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
M@@ e neither .
But for 5 years , and only for five years , it was perfect .
In 19@@ 40 he held the head of the other ar@@ tis@@ an@@ os of the government who wanted to discuss an &quot; agreement &quot; with the Naz@@ is and he very ably won .
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy , he united the country in the idea that fighting against fasc@@ ists was the only way to win .
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom , and of France , and of Belgium and , in the end , the entire world , can thank God for having had over these five years , just these five years , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the bar and no one else .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
That its des@@ c@@ endants sell the pain@@ ts on the free market to collect money from inher@@ it@@ ance fees , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to admi@@ res one in a mus@@ e@@ um , let them get the money to buy it .
It &apos;s as simple as that .
But we could use tax money .
Nobody can deny that when it was &quot; the moment of truth &quot; , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A revival of the internal market by public works will only help big companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by avoiding hi@@ ring , with infrastructure sites by definition not renewable .
As for the social reforms recommended by the minister , they really reflect the real bad fran@@ c@@ i :
Re@@ turn to the pr@@ inc@@ es values .
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory .
That the lowest of us is not in need !
Either solidarity , we come to his help , or he has D@@ R@@ ILO in exchange for the services he makes or has given to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H that I prefer to sm@@ ash corresponds to this vision .
There is also the gir@@ l@@ friend who lives income from his properties .
You need to differenti@@ ate the person who in@@ ve@@ sts for a return when he reti@@ res and who lives from his rents .
A good to rent or even two for a couple above it .
The little gen@@ i@@ us gen@@ ie is sing@@ ul@@ arly lacking .
The new deal was a policy of big work , but at a time of defici@@ ency in major infrastructure .
Today , in Europe and in France , it &apos;s not the case .
The developed countries are su@@ dered .
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution .
Especially at a time when the question of growth is emerging in response to a recession that is only wild growth so brutal .
You would have been right 30 years ago : more need ( or possibilities ) of dam@@ s , coal mines , high@@ ways ...
But if we want to make the future climate shock less ruin , then the need for investment is cr@@ ying : insul@@ ation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transport and energy storage etc ...
A tax that fav@@ ors high income and r@@ whole .
Who is in power ?
Ob@@ st@@ é by the smar@@ t@@ phones .
Charles Ar@@ th@@ ur is really a gal@@ op@@ in .
Sam@@ sun@@ g &apos;s benefits are hurt by the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and its competitors in the same range
The introduction in mid-@@ September by Ap@@ ple of bigger scre@@ ens for the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and 6 Pl@@ us perhaps attracted bu@@ yers who would otherwise have bought a Gal@@ ax@@ y .
I tried all these phones and decided for L@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a customer , but not for Ap@@ ple &apos;s benefit .
I think it &apos;s essential that we have an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft put in place this philosophy , we had a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google , Ap@@ ple and the community op@@ en source .
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development .
Also , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
For me , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple , because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design .
Some people don &apos;t attach value to design , for them the options , func@@ tionality and the price are pri@@ mi@@ tive .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let &apos;s stop looking for &quot; a better platform &quot; .
Is there a &quot; better car manufacturer &quot; , not really , they are different , but similar .
I would like to see a thri@@ ving port@@ able industry with radically different approaches for different people and markets .
It &apos;s cleaner and must be encouraged .
This is in our interest .
I am happy that you found exactly what you &apos;@@ re looking for and that it &apos;s not a Ap@@ ple product , even if I had a different choice .
Most people I know have i@@ Ph@@ hon@@ es .
Our um@@ ber friends that according to one of them fight the ideas and not the men ( on the contrary , well on the Par@@ is@@ ian b@@ ob@@ os ) could tell us what ( the ) is author if they fight the ideas on the gender and tell us the books they intend to fight for .
Or do they attack the kind of gender described in Le Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te or Val@@ ours A@@ N@@ T ?
Their sources are Ju@@ di@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I like you , and you &apos;@@ re someone smart and educated .
I said this on Ju@@ ith in the ve@@ in of F@@ ur@@ us@@ to talking about Hol@@ ph@@ er@@ ne , rapprochement that di@@ dn &apos;t come to me ( I don &apos;t have his vir@@ acity in mind ) .
Otherwise , in the &quot; bottom &quot; , since you refer to it , this subject doesn &apos;t interest me , and sincerely I don &apos;t see where the problem is : I was hoping that you and your friends could get out of my back@@ war@@ dness , because I &apos;@@ m slow but I understand ...
@ Jean : recognize that , cul@@ turally , send Jud@@ ith to Hol@@ ph@@ er@@ ne , that does it .
Who is sc@@ ared wonder Le Mon@@ de ?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid ?
F@@ ur@@ as@@ to and @ us give some answers .
The first by invo@@ king the Ju@@ de@@ th of the Bi@@ ble , the second by quali@@ fying Ju@@ d@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler for a very symbol@@ ism that is very symbolic .
We can see how in@@ tim@@ ate these studies touch at home .
We are obviously no longer in the discussion debate .
It &apos;s something else , much deeper .
Did you read , Jean , that Le Mon@@ de published an article about the need for the@@ ology ?
@ : With regard to an idea debate , I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources .
To claim to fight against ideas from the only presentation that their de@@ tr@@ actors do ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ atz@@ inger , inven@@ tor of the General The@@ ory or X L@@ ac@@ ro@@ i@@ x , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ en ) does not seem very rigorous .
But good , as I explained to our friend , U@@ p@@ f@@ alist , it &apos;s all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion .
I &apos;@@ m not sure that he &apos;s understood the nu@@ ance .
I di@@ dn &apos;t read Ju@@ di@@ ith , the very symbol@@ ism of thro@@ at , I was content with the &quot; second sex &quot; ( it was more of my time ) which is the source of &quot; source &quot; according to the wishes of L@@ o .
While I watched the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se since M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , I saw red lights when the mo@@ on was briefly shown when the cl@@ ou@@ ds opened up .
This sudden appearance of the red l@@ a had its char@@ m and compensated a little the disappointment to have the view blocked by cl@@ ou@@ ds .
It was ama@@ zing here at F@@ N@@ Q .
Yes , last night &apos;s cl@@ oud would really bur@@ n the coast of Vic@@ tor@@ ia and N@@ S@@ W , while most of the rest of Australia had clear time .
F@@ l@@ ash special la@@ zy of blood .
Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t / Jo@@ e Ho@@ key make the Lab@@ or responsible .
But if the Lab@@ or accepts our unfair budget , we will make it its full col@@ or as soon as possible .
Do you obs@@ ess yourself , no ?
I was in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne so naturally I saw only cl@@ ou@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne has also managed to cover himself during the entire week of the rain of the Per@@ se@@ ini weather and for almost all the astr@@ on@@ om@@ ical phenomena of recent years .
I &apos;@@ m starting to think that there is a bad gen@@ i@@ us whose only goal is to prevent people from M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything from the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an observatory , even if things are greatly improved on the other side of the Cor@@ d@@ il@@ ère .
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see ec@@ li@@ p@@ se because of cl@@ ou@@ ds above the sub@@ ur@@ bs of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
I &apos;@@ m going to put a TA@@ X@@ E on this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se .
Q@@ U@@ I@@ K@@ ON@@ G looks at this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se should pay a TA@@ X@@ E .
I be@@ t that your first thought of the day is for Ab@@ bo@@ t , just like the last one before c@@ iting you .
Who or what will you get when it ends ( necessarily ) by disappearing ?
It seems that you take a long time to read the discussions when looking for messages in which people critici@@ ze the Ab@@ bot@@ t government and then accuse them of being obs@@ essed .

The article says too much or not enough .
The detail and the arguments of these recommendations are not given .
No hy@@ per@@ text link to original documents so that one can get an opinion .
G@@ o to see today , Tuesday , 15 October the results of mirac@@ les : in Spain , exports have been at the lowest for five years .
In Greece , the stock market collap@@ ses .
But these are the examples to follow .
The reform of no@@ tar@@ ies would generate a request for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros .
The Ministry of economics claims that these claims for compensation are not justified .
What if the Ministry of the Econom@@ y is wrong ?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefits resulting from the courageous attack of no@@ tar@@ ies have the same courage when the bill is presented to the state budget ?
The next one .
O@@ k , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ...
@ lo@@ l No the state is not comparable to households as to the management of its budget because the time horizon of the state is theore@@ tically infin@@ ite while the household is limited by the life span of its members .
Moreover , unless we consider that public spending is un@@ productive , these contribute to financing material and int@@ an@@ gible investments in the growth of tomorrow and thus in future reci@@ pes .
A few elements of response .
A sad decision .
But remember the sac@@ red s@@ ore of Hi@@ p@@ po@@ cr@@ at : the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be safeguarded above all .
The theory of con@@ spir@@ acy .
Unfortunately the truth does not correspond to your fant@@ asy .
Med@@ ical staff would like to use it , but they have the hands of the law as written by the policies .
It &apos;s the same situation as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions rather than having risky sur@@ gical interventions , safe ho@@ ho@@ ot rooms for drug addic@@ ts rather than having them in the streets , etc .
On these issues , politicians want to please the accused m@@ asses .
Ac@@ tually , doctors don &apos;t earn money with medic@@ ation .
That &apos;s why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors don &apos;t earn money with medicines since Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States , you should find out how it works .
Every@@ where in the world doctors are cour@@ ted in the same way , but it &apos;s more or less visible .
It was perhaps poorly formulated to put the blame on the T@@ H@@ ub@@ bs , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to the profits of companies and the &quot; research &quot; .
Lis@@ ten to the few reports on our spending of P@@ harm@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ its Sch@@ em@@ e and the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ting the world prices of medicines present everywhere , as well as the differences between countries on what is on free sale or only on prescri@@ ption .
This is strengthening it is a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific process , direct or indirect .
In fact , some companies are currently doing tests on mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ ations against on@@ co@@ logical pain , despite the laws that are holding them back and the expensive permits necessary .
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that we use alternatives such as mari@@ ju@@ ana , those who manage to have a version offering good quality products to well-known do@@ ses will benefit largely .
S@@ or@@ ry to tell you , Madam , but you &apos;@@ re wrong , a lot of things happen in the corridors for doctors and pharm@@ acy .
As for this hospital , they were happy to use it until someone put the chi@@ p on the ear of a person responsible for this hospital .

If the &quot; researchers &quot; in social sciences were research instead of politics and net@@ working , we could use their &quot; work &quot; .
A resear@@ cher investigation , he doesn &apos;t compare one fact to another .
Com@@ par@@ able is not looking for it .
Com@@ par@@ ing it is making the teaching not research .
We can &apos;t say &quot; research is successful , you have to apply it &quot; and then in the same trip &quot; you have to experiment with everything . &quot;
If your sear@@ ches are successful why experiment ?
If your research is not successful why ask you to apply them ?
Can I explain how a &quot; resear@@ cher &quot; can de@@ duce that a student who can &apos;t equ@@ ate mathema@@ tics alone could as@@ simil@@ ate mathema@@ tics and other materials more easily ?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on condition that students learn to use new technologies but how would they manage to learn new technologies if they don &apos;t know how to learn ?
The p@@ is@@ a tests are only an indicator . Let us make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory .
What is the point of building an indicator that in@@ forms you of what suits you , a will of au@@ to-@@ promotion , a dec@@ eption ?
A single path to train teachers : far away from training the S@@ oph@@ ists and ideolo@@ gues and the practi@@ tioners teach practi@@ tioners .
manufacture the paragraph on the intern@@ ships ( which unfortunately is not very argued ) and you will see that your conclusion push@@ es us to the most inefficient conser@@ va@@ tism : &quot; It &apos;s a de@@ vice that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices , and which does not allow the system to progress . &quot;
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , we can &apos;t hope that only the practi@@ tioners teach practi@@ tioners , even if they have all their place in modern training of teachers .
Education the@@ or@@ ists should have no place .
The practi@@ tioners must have one .
Would you want to be operated by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and which has never set foot in a block operating before ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system problems .
Gi@@ ving more weight to education the@@ or@@ ists , it would be destroy it definitively .
Your analo@@ gy is completely cra@@ zy : if I don &apos;t want to be operated by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has only theoretical training , I would still like to make myself operate by a sur@@ ge@@ on who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the t@@ ack .

Thank you very much .
If one day I begin to feel guilty of infr@@ inging copyright , I &apos;@@ ll have to read an article like this .
In an information economy , the violation of copyright = stolen .
It &apos;s the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly .
Often , getting a licen@@ se doesn &apos;t cost anything .
No , it &apos;s a violation of copyright .
Not at all the same thing .
By using content without having the right licen@@ se , you deprive the artists of their livelihood .
You can always debate educational hypo@@ thes@@ es - but it &apos;s stolen .
And you can repeat it as much as you like , it will not become true .
It &apos;s a violation of copyright .
Let &apos;s repeat it again .
If one day I start to feel guilty of infr@@ inging copyright law
Clearly , that doesn &apos;t b@@ other you to deprive artists of their income .
If they think they should be given money for images used in school duties , an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use , so I &apos;@@ m happy to deprive them of this shadow income .
lesson no 1 should be to show how , if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their fav@@ or@@ ite social networks , they abandon all intellectual property at the site under the general conditions they have spent from a c@@ lic@@ k .
Maybe if they share the head@@ phones of their bal@@ ad@@ er p@@ 3 with a gir@@ l@@ friend in the school bus , they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way .

I have 2 children and when they &apos;@@ ll be an age of choice , I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then .
France sho@@ ots people down by constantly assisting them .
I don &apos;t want my children to bear the debts that this policy will have created .
What brings France to the bottom is the speeches like yours .
@ gu@@ y I &apos;@@ ve been working in private companies since always .
I had the C@@ HA@@ N@@ CE to have worked in companies run by excellent business managers : it exists in France but it &apos;s rare .
I &apos;@@ m a employee because I know that I don &apos;t have the skills to lead a company and this choice allows me to sho@@ ot my red but@@ tons on the na@@ ked bos@@ ses I frequently meet .
At ease , I completely share Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ j@@ an &apos;s post . He says the horri@@ ble truth !
@ gu@@ y , if we compare with German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly cite reforms in France , in Germany , companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive , especially by ensuring the link between big companies and the medium and small ones - what are French bos@@ ses waiting for to do as much ?
That the State keeps them in their hands ?
This state that they are acc@@ using ?
@ Jacques L@@ .
Still , this k@@ ni@@ fe an@@ ti your company !
Rem@@ ember , what did you create as jobs , as added value , to be as severe ?
I understand your reaction .
In reality , France faces an in@@ solu@@ ble problem : the in@@ competence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who dam@@ n and dam@@ n while waiting for the permanent state state assist@@ ant !
That &apos;s terrible !
But they have solutions : suppression of the Lab@@ or Code , employers &apos; charges , taxes , work 4@@ 5@@ h / week paid 35 , and some , wal@@ king on eggs , dare to demand lower wages or their removal !
I look forward to seeing all the &quot; negative &quot; comments on this subject .
What &apos;s ironic given the way people always complain about F@@ ir@@ st Group .
From what I see from where I am , L@@ ass has not really been an investment for us taxpayers .
They tried to stay af@@ lo@@ at rather than transform themselves .
It doesn &apos;t mean that Scottish railways have not improved since L@@ as@@ t deals with it .
But they had also improved with their predecessors , including British R@@ ail .
Unfortunately , we do not have the power to do that , unfortunately .
I tried to have them recently , but I di@@ dn &apos;t succeed .
But good , Lab@@ or will get us anno@@ ying , is@@ n &apos;t it ...
It &apos;s an international subsidiary .
They already operate trains in Germany .
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in ten@@ ders .
But it seems that we are not very good in management , most of our priva@@ tized services end up being managed by a foreign operator .
I still remember the scandal and criticism when F@@ ir@@ st won the Vir@@ g@@ in contract , all this for the decision to finally be cancelled .
And there &apos;s better : M@@ T@@ R , a Hong Kong company has won the C@@ ros@@ s@@ rail contract contract for 8 years .
Well , the Lab@@ or , as they told us during the referendum campaign , is completely for po@@ oling and sharing and thinks that workers must all help themselves across borders .
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ; )
Maybe because the Dutch management is on good track when the British are not .
What S@@ co@@ t@@ R@@ ail needs is not just a change of owner but especially new ideas .

As@@ sum@@ ing that being &quot; beaten &quot; is a higher quality than many others , the concern of others , intelligence , listening , for example , the fact of being &quot; beaten &quot; has nothing to do with the one to survive a disease : &quot; bat@@ ting &quot; canc@@ ers , who are no less dead , I know of some pat@@ ches .
S@@ or@@ ry of a disease has nothing to do with merit .

Nothing to do with any merit ... !
When the examples of your life , you can judge them .
I start again .
In@@ s@@ oring , if only for a while , that we can have some merit in getting out of a disease or we can deser@@ t not to get out of it , is simply mon@@ str@@ ous .
The body follows or does not follow .
A body that leaves , everywhere , despite the will , despite the confidence in medicine , you have a vague idea of what C ?
N@@ a@@ ve to think the opposite , if , having a solid mor@@ ale , it probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it , to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them for fear .@@ .
Some@@ one who is beaten in medicine is above all someone who tru@@ sts medicine .
But if we prefer to rely on the &quot; l@@ ord &quot; it &apos;s something else .@@ .
Neither with the deserved nor with the courage .
These considerations are specific to mor@@ alists .
When you caught a sal@@ ty , a real one , you &apos;@@ re getting to the point of becoming only a z@@ om@@ bi@@ e .
Personally , I caught two , sal@@ ty , big , and if I &quot; beat &quot; as these psycho@@ log@@ ists say , it completely escap@@ ed me .

I thought the accusation against Milosevic was decided and fin@@ alized a dozen years ago .
I have not seen this name in the newspapers since at least that time .
What is happening ?
It &apos;s an anniversary .
A forgotten anniversary .
His trial was conducted &quot; quickly &quot; and then swept away under the car@@ pet .
Is this the story we told at the time ?
The communist who has become nationalist that triggered three wars in the Balkans during the last decade ?
The communist president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
So please , ask what we voluntarily left aside : 1 .
How could the NATO bombing be legal under L@@ A M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ R@@ E rule of international law ?
Which country did Serbia attack ?
Regarding R@@ TS ( Rad@@ i@@ o-@@ Tele@@ visi@@ on-@@ Ser@@ bi@@ a ) , why do you not mention that NATO destroyed this same building while killing civilians , then considered it a valid target .
Milosevic had no way to get out of it : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , it would be cru@@ ci@@ fied like a tra@@ itor .
And if he defended him , he would be sw@@ apped by the Western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
The West used a smoke scre@@ en to de@@ t@@ ach a part of a sovereign state that unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was almost recognized by the western states that then li@@ ed to end up in the situation on the ground .
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , is dead politically after his first term for not understanding the situation that had developed .
Z@@ or@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic was one of the most controversial figures in the politics of the time .
At the end of the day , Gu@@ ard@@ an shoul@@ dn &apos;t call Milosevic by ty@@ rant ( even if we don &apos;t like it ) .
As far as I know , there is only in Greece a method of predic@@ ting earthquakes works around the corner , by measure the peak level in the quar@@ tz .
This kind of studies is definitely useful and thank you for making us share the results .
A hope , therefore , but the caution has nothing to do with that of the ex@@ op@@ lan@@ de@@ te named HA@@ T@@ -@@ P 1@@ 1@@ b , located at about 1@@ 24 years of the Earth in the C@@ y@@ gn@@ us C@@ y@@ gn@@ us that would be &quot; the smallest and the co@@ ol planet to present m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules of detec@@ table water &quot; , according to a study carried out by the D@@ uck As@@ k team and J@@ on@@ a@@ than F@@ ra@@ ine at the University of Mar@@ y@@ land
So let &apos;s follow .
Like those that involve animals that feel a threat .
Thank you .
How would animals know ( in advance ) ?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the event of se@@ ism .
Like ra@@ don , for example .
G@@ as gas that is an insult to man but maybe dec@@ el@@ able by animals .
All these methods are in@@ trac@@ table for man , but not for the measu@@ rement instruments available to him .
But we do not have any reliable results on these paths ...
It has been repeatedly observed ( and for centuries ) that some animals act in a strange way for a few hours with an earthquake , especially the chic@@ ken , cows , dogs , but especially fish and sh@@ it .
I had seen a report on the map telling the fight of two scientific teams , a Califor@@ n@@ ian , the other Japanese , to make the validity of their work that related to the sensitivity of animals to the ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al mag@@ netic fields , especially to their change before a se@@ ism .
So I &apos;@@ m not a scienti@@ st , but their hypo@@ thes@@ es convinced me !
Or what about this research ?
Why so much contempt for this path ?
We should learn to listen to nature ...
If we look at things cal@@ m@@ ly and rigorously , we publish it in a serious review , and no one is mistaken .
As soon as we &apos;@@ re talking about the &quot; signs &quot; given by animals , we run into the same bias : everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish was we@@ ir@@ d in circles .
I don &apos;t understand why we can think that Bor@@ is would make a good leader for the Conservatives .
He did too much as a may@@ or of London .
When you listen to the L@@ BC program we can &apos;t help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he always tries to dis@@ tract with a jo@@ ke .
It never responds directly to any one .
He also said he agrees with Far@@ age , then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari the presen@@ ter asked him about what .
He could not name a single point .
He made so many promises to get elected as may@@ or and he di@@ dn &apos;t have one alone .
It only stresses how much the rest of the Conservative Party is only a sh@@ it@@ ty sh@@ it , no ?
Because he &apos;s popular .
Because it &apos;s fun@@ ny .
He was in &quot; H@@ a@@ ve I Go@@ t Ne@@ or Y@@ ou &quot; .
Because it &apos;s a celebr@@ ity and we have accused people of ad@@ mitting the cele@@ bri@@ ties .
The Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country .
When ( and not if ) he takes the leadership of the party , the popularity ratings of the T@@ ories will stop the ceiling I am sure .
Let God help us .
I &apos;@@ m not so sure : people like jo@@ kes , but do not want their prime minister to be one of them .
That &apos;s exactly what we said Lon@@ don@@ ers .
He should have brought his friend with him the par@@ p@@ ain@@ g .
In many ways , I think he &apos;s trying to copy R B@@ ran@@ on .
The Americans had one like President .
The French were really and always dis@@ interested in the history of the Pacific war .
For all those who gave themselves the trouble to read a few books ( there exist , including a French and excellent one of B@@ .
Mil@@ lot ) , the &quot; Sol@@ om@@ on &quot; and the &quot; Stra@@ it Stra@@ it &quot; speak , as unfortunately as the dead who stay@@ ed there .
We understand that the Austr@@ ali@@ ans , who know ( one of their heavy cr@@ on@@ ies , the Austr@@ ali@@ a , must always be in the background since the battle of Sav@@ o ) do not want to go back there .
We actually went in front of the I@@ le de S@@ av@@ o , in the &quot; I@@ on B@@ ot@@ to@@ m Round . &quot;
Even if the mission comes to an end .
It &apos;s the small .
But the ec@@ o side is a total en@@ m@@ ance .
Ma@@ ke the k@@ ero@@ z@@ en@@ e consumed in order to reach the objective completely dis@@ credits the concept .@@ .
You only need to go through the list of spons@@ ors .
A co@@ m operation more or less or not .
The cow , it gives too much en@@ vy ! ! !
I &apos;@@ m looking forward to the web@@ series !
Your comment makes me back again , identifying myself a little in the passage ( I also learned to s@@ ail with the Cro@@ co@@ s of La El@@ or@@ n at the M@@ ou@@ in B@@ lan@@ c in ra@@ p of B@@ est ! ) .
Change too for the ec@@ ological message , even if some people critici@@ ze the impact of the investment .
The end justify the means .
Contin@@ ue to get back , and to show with pride that Bre@@ tons are big travellers !
Pi@@ er@@ re , Tro@@ ini@@ ad and Tob@@ ago .
H@@ ell@@ o night I think the red box that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British region and the V@@ ille de B@@ ran@@ rest .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies in any way should not spend a s@@ word of our taxes to finance the dreams of a few ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rers , even nice ones .
Are there any players in current Ser@@ b training who is of Kosov@@ ar origin ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ ene@@ vic in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , once in the Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now in the Fr@@ é@@ er@@ b@@ ç@@ e , are Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I don &apos;t know if they &apos;@@ re still in the team .
It &apos;s Bis@@ sa@@ a@@ c the defen@@ der of L@@ y@@ on , not B@@ joy .
B@@ joy was in the middle of the ground or before in the 7@@ 0s and 8@@ 0s and led to many teams in Greece , but I don &apos;t know where he is .
B@@ joy is Mo@@ star , in Bosnia-Herzegovina , and played as an attack on the great team of ve@@ ez who , under the tu@@ t@@ el@@ aire of the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary .
Well , thank you Mo@@ le !
Of course I know H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ zi@@ c and Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c .
Just out of cu@@ ri@@ osity , what happened to K@@ ra@@ si@@ c ?
We said he was going to become a big player when he was in the Ju@@ ve , he is currently in Turkey , but the last time he appeared on my ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en he was linked to Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n * fr@@ uck *
Here , I can &apos;t help you .
I know he lost his place when Con@@ te arrived , then he went to the F@@ en@@ er and as much as I know he is not a holder .
Maybe he can still do something , perhaps in the Indian Sup@@ er League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Ser@@ iously , Albania is not afraid .
You should love Albania because you are neighbors .
The thing is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of real Albania today .
Ap@@ parently it was the flag of the Great Albania , which encomp@@ asses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
A bit of excessive nationalism , actually .
Fortunately , there was not too much damage ( I know ) .
Ac@@ tually , it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what we call the Great Albania , but of Albania pre-@@ 19@@ 13 , when the major European powers decided to give the country &apos;s books to the neighbors .
How can you feel &quot; an explo@@ sions of joy &quot; when seeing two tow@@ ers collap@@ sing knowing that women , men and women without doubt are inside ?
How ?
What anno@@ ys me a little in this &quot; testi@@ mony &quot; is that the only fact of having been able , if only once , to rejo@@ ice spontane@@ ously about the horri@@ ble death of thousands of people , testi@@ fies to my eyes of a &quot; bor@@ der &quot; personality whose &quot; testi@@ monies &quot; should be taken with the greatest circum@@ spec@@ tion .
No doubt , in the short time of &quot; joy &quot; , we won &apos;t think about the deaths or the reality of the horror inflicted .
We &apos;@@ ve just thought , for a moment , that for once , Muslims had managed to do really and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tically hurt to the big gu@@ y S@@ at@@ an in his very heart .
To make a powerful q@@ q@@ ich .
G@@ o .
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims r@@ ated by their feeling of humiliation .
With testi@@ monies fil@@ med in Palestine .
C@@ l@@ assi@@ que Sch@@ ad@@ en@@ fr@@ u@@ de .
We doubt it a little .
The &quot; Christian / white / g@@ au@@ tiful &quot; West can &apos;t measure the degree of che@@ ese , anger , hate of mu@@ su@@ man when it con@@ spir@@ ates the gen@@ i@@ us misery , the social and cultural under@@ development of the Muslim Arab@@ o world of today &apos;s .
I &apos;@@ m talking about the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not about Du@@ b@@ i &apos;s tow@@ ers .
The past s@@ len@@ der , certainly mag@@ ni@@ fied is not a cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil circle ?
T@@ ot@@ ally in phase , 2 pois@@ ons irrit@@ ate the Arab world : the bi@@ king conser@@ va@@ tism of the powers in place and fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common point , the freeze of thought and the ex@@ communication ( soft or army ) of its critical expression .
Whether we understood it before , shoul@@ dn &apos;t let Muslims back down .
That &apos;s the only way .
Ed@@ w@@ y P@@ len@@ el has he read this article ?
I suppose it &apos;s true in many countries .
But in Great Britain , the fall marks the beginning of six long , dark and de@@ pressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people .
In addition , everyone falls ill .
S@@ or@@ ry pressure .
I &apos;@@ m suffering myself .
When the light goes , it becomes hell for me and those like me .
A do@@ se of vitam@@ in D should help a little for hum@@ or and well-being .
The fall is beautiful in Britain , with or without rain .
The campaign in particular is to be cut in the fall .
Not as much to cut the b@@ reath as the green gu@@ y when everything is alive instead of being about to die .
In Britain , if you have luck , the summer comes at a weekend .
We had a nice summer this year , don &apos;t make your g@@ in@@ ch@@ ous that brings back c@@ lic@@ h@@ és !
Not everyone .
I rarely fall ill in winter .
But now I &apos;@@ m reti@@ red and I don &apos;t expand immunity to the ger@@ ms from outside , it can change , I suppose .
It &apos;s not about to die , it &apos;s just a step in a cycle ...
A mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous stage full of bo@@ g@@ us sm@@ ell@@ s , with a f@@ es@@ ti@@ val that dri@@ ves with f@@ es@@ tiv@@ als like H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , the risks of coming back and lots of other wonderful words .
You only need to stop doing things !
These are my recommendations for the animals for you .
Yes , these dark and gri@@ m months actually make me much happ@@ ier and more rela@@ xed .
For the f@@ uc@@ king of children &apos;s inc@@ rements , it &apos;s the amount paid by the government that comes mainly from dec@@ im@@ al 8 to 10 .
But when it comes to the number of households having seen their tax increase following this measure , it &apos;s especially the 4 and 5 dec@@ rees that are affected ( medi@@ an income ) according to grap@@ h 2 .
The removal of half a part concerning the wid@@ ows is not dealt with at all in the article or rather its impact is completely under evaluation : 2@@ 30 M euros is a jo@@ ke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is in@@ do@@ rent .
And it &apos;s not ready to make arrangements .
Well , we &apos;@@ re not on the stra@@ w , certainly , but
For once the PS does a rather left-wing policy , we &apos;@@ re not going to cry ...
It is obvious that those who are part of the 20 % richest have to bear much more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let &apos;s continue to do so and encourage these 20 % less to work or leave .
Well , I know , it &apos;s not politically correct , but I say it anyway .
Vi@@ ve the Tro@@ ts and the recyc@@ led C@@ IS at the PS : they understood everything .
Adam , you can &apos;t see what you &apos;@@ re looking for .
The proportion is always the same , here or in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population has 80 % of wealth .
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from am@@ assing as much as he can .
Beyond a certain limit , money loses all its value .
And once it &apos;s over@@ taken the value of money , money only serves to make money , it &apos;s ) to say to do the mis@@ fortune of the largest number .
We are among the 20 % richest .
No doubt also the 20 % of households that work most ( and create the wealth that a part is logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must allow these households to enjoy some of their efforts .
Or so much lower the arms and living on social minimum , especially if we have social housing .
The ut@@ op@@ ies of the heads of the heads at the red k@@ h@@ mer have fortunately lived .
I did two Air@@ B@@ n@@ B in Norway recently .
No problem .
In one of the two , we had things that we w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t have had in a 5 star hot@@ els and we di@@ dn &apos;t have to submit to the recei@@ pt or face the slightest trace .
You only need to go to someone , to sle@@ ep there , to row behind and leave again .
From now on it will be my first option when I travel .
The lo@@ go changed , people ...
Take your insurance before you rent your house .
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance .
En@@ sure to use a service with the right lo@@ go !
A@@ h , 6@@ h too late .
I love Air@@ b@@ n@@ b .
&quot; It &apos;s very dangerous and highly risky &quot; No it &apos;s not true .
You just missed the chance .
According to the link provided in the article :
In his discharge , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to T@@ em@@ an was quick , almost absur@@ dly fast .
In 24 hours , according to an e-@@ mail provided to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b had sent a police officer to change the need@@ les , made provisions to spend a week in the ho@@ tel and transfer 23 8@@ 17 $ ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b is assured , but still ) .
So why does this article quote T@@ em@@ an complaining he has received no support from Air@@ b@@ n@@ b ?
I &apos;@@ m going to A@@ IR@@ B@@ N@@ B to get like to travel
H@@ ell@@ o , I &apos;@@ m looking for people who have already used b@@ n@@ b just to reassure me .
I &apos;@@ m planning to pay a pun@@ ch and a month of rent , but I &apos;@@ m a bit sc@@ ared of sending £ 1 600 to a site that I never really heard about .
But where are you going ?
&quot; Sup@@ porting the troops &quot; s@@ inging the $ B@@ u to all of them ...
So harm@@ less .
I &apos;@@ m sure that it will please families and relatives of the thousands of Kurdish people who died in hal@@ ab@@ ah to learn that their parents and friends have succum@@ bed to anything other than the chemical bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ments of S@@ ad@@ d@@ dam .
Unless the content of the article has been drastically modified by the author , your comment is in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited ( to stay pol@@ ite ) .
Also , how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
It &apos;s not hy@@ per clear the author &apos;s style : &quot; in search of weapons of mass destruction .
We agree .
You think it &apos;s the time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education , because we &apos;@@ re still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ native : it &apos;s TO@@ U@@ J@@ O@@ UR@@ S the time to strengthen education , because we &apos;@@ re still at war ?
We would already increase education a lot if you &quot; have worked 35 hours instead of 17 . &quot;
At the moment , our teachers currently earn more than engineers .
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program .
But it doesn &apos;t happen because National Education does not have the means to provide an office in college / high school with its pro@@ s so they work at home .
A kind of forced tele@@ working in sum , except that the employer doesn &apos;t pay the computer , neither the internet connection nor the supplies .
Moreover , it &apos;s so much the 5 hours per week and 4 months of vac@@ ation that we can &apos;t fill CA@@ P@@ S of men , come and wait .
How do you have any desire to get rid of poorly educated chi@@ pp@@ ings whose parents are cr@@ ying on you by treating you as something ?
I think that the priority in this area is to dis@@ arm the ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts so that the k@@ ne@@ e population can better flourish .
Where we see that the Bush administration absolutely did everything .
My first gradu@@ ate job was in the sale , in London , to earn three times nothing and it was still a job for which a diplom@@ a was needed .
A year later , I saw an announcement to be worker for the London sub@@ way , it was paid £ 5 000 more per year and we did not even ask for the patents .
I never regret .
On this subject , do not do you if you do not find a job gradu@@ ate , try to find something either that pays well , or that you like to do .
If I had stay@@ ed with gradu@@ ated jobs , I would still have to pay my loan student .
I don &apos;t like work in companies so I hope in the end to pass either in the civil service or in the university world .
L@@ OL L@@ OL L@@ OL , this article arri@@ ves late !
Ex@@ ac@@ tly , when I got my diplom@@ a in 2011 , there was already a three-@@ year old arri@@ ft .
The best way to reduce the number of gradu@@ ates without jobs ?
To get rid of Bis@@ oun@@ t sectors as art / letters / theat@@ re / media / philosophy / political sciences is to say what we call the unemployed degrees .
I have one of these degrees and I ended up working director .
It turned out that the important thing was not the diplom@@ a but , as the article said , a good professional journey , starting at school and throughout the university .
Yes , the starting salary was lower but we quickly clim@@ b the lad@@ der because in the real world what matters is results more than knowledge .
This debate studies by engine@@ er / artistic sectors lasted for years .
Scienti@@ sts can &apos;t solve all the problems , it &apos;s more important to be able to get up in the morning , to get to work at the time and to inter@@ act with people so they can get results .
Le@@ t@@ ters , philosophy and art are b@@ is@@ oun@@ t sectors ?
It &apos;s ridiculous .
I suppose you &apos;@@ re talking about the type of degrees study of the media or whatever the missing sector where you went .
Le@@ t@@ ters , philosophy , political sciences and art are real sectors .
We need people who can explain the big questions to students , who understand the importance of the bases of culture like literature , art , etc . , and put them in value .
It would not be better a real territorial policy to dis@@ ent@@ angle Paris and boost the rest of France ?
Personally , I do not see the inhabitants of the Fin@@ ne and V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise people doing 8@@ 0@@ km aller@@ gic every bi@@ ke day to come and work in Paris .
In@@ tra@@ -@@ me@@ at@@ os and the little bel@@ t already have many public transportation methods that are much more practical ( me@@ tr@@ o , bus , tra@@ m ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Several safe par@@ ks that are safe and closed to key , as already exists in the cities of the north of Europe , in Di@@ j@@ on or in L@@ y@@ on , will be inst@@ alled on the ship .
Good idea .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the 2@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , we hope that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark .
As much as benefiting from their big experience in the field .
Well , we di@@ dn &apos;t find any room for U@@ N S@@ E@@ U@@ L .
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ and Del@@ an@@ o@@ e ...
Well , it doesn &apos;t go at all .
When we talk with pedestri@@ ans and other public transportation users for reasons why they don &apos;t teach me it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are : 1 / it is hy@@ per dangerous with all these things , these tr@@ uc@@ ks , these sco@@ o@@ ters that drive fast and don &apos;t care about the survival of bic@@ yc@@ les 2 / we get a lot of pollution in the head .
The bi@@ ke paths are apar@@ theid , you have to co@@ exist but re@@ balance the occupation of the urban space .
Nothing about bi@@ ke in the big Paris ?
Not a word about the place of bi@@ ke in public transportation ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .
The target of 15 % in bi@@ kes is ridiculous .
I &apos;@@ m starting to believe that An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go thre@@ w the Greens in the meal .
Also , from afternoon to afternoon , the V@@ EL@@ V ad@@ joining seems skep@@ tical .
I want to be optimistic .
Before the rac@@ ket starts , it would be better to find who really hi@@ des behind this massacre .
Indian : it &apos;s not Russia .
Not sure to like the way the world develops .
It looks horri@@ ble .
My children are not a financial asset .
A lawyer expressed his intention to wear the case in front of the EC@@ HR , but I di@@ dn &apos;t hear that a complaint was actually lod@@ ged .
Moreover , they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine .
I also expect these cases to be delayed pending the result of the investigation report on the accident and the resulting criminal investigation .
Y@@ e@@ ah , but Libya di@@ dn &apos;t blow P@@ an A@@ M . No more .
Mal@@ ay@@ sia Air@@ lines is not wrong , the blame lies with the authority responsible for the security of the air space , in this case the Ukrainian government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had been killed before , Ukraine launched air attacks against the rebels and any plane could of course be considered as a possible and immediate threat .
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay the rights of over@@ flying the territory ?
Where are all the pro-@@ Ki@@ ev tro@@ ll who defend their u@@ sur@@ p@@ tor government / the ultra-@@ nation@@ alists of West Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in great terms that Putin has shot the M@@ H@@ 17 flight .
As far as I know , there is already a complaint against the government of Ki@@ ev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky .
The previous one : a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Con@@ tra@@ s in Nicaragua does not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions .
No chance that Russia will let this affair go to the IC@@ J .
It &apos;s fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ box means to Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans have been killed by rebels supported by Russia .
I hope he can present evidence to support his claims .
Up to now , the investig@@ ators have said nothing about this .
To call himself Ric@@ al@@ do and to be such a baby , it &apos;s awful !
To call Pol@@ aire is losing the north is happy .
A only B@@ e@@ ti@@ tian question : is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday ?
I can &apos;t fail to notice that those who critici@@ ze the most vir@@ ulent the Pi@@ ke@@ tty book did not read it !
It &apos;s easy to read , I put a few days .
It shows the statistical evolution of res@@ us@@ -@@ production , res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le , unequal concentration , inequality of labor income , the property of capital , deserves and inher@@ it@@ ance in the lo@@ g .
It shows that the concentration of today &apos;s capital join@@ s that of the beginning of 20 ° before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it &apos;s the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital , of 19@@ 14 in 19@@ 45 , then how the concentration resume after ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : you don &apos;t see what .
I ask you how long it took you to read this pa@@ ste knowing that an individual &apos;s concentration capacity has a few limits .
Secondly , the question is not whether it &apos;s easy to read .
The question is if the summary of the central thesis that the press gave is right or not .
If she is right , we can debate her without reading the book , the essential thing of which is to argue one-@@ way in favor of her .
No , it &apos;s easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : how long did you put to read it ?
Is the central thesis of his pa@@ sty summar@@ ized by the press false ?
I di@@ dn &apos;t read and will not read it .
I therefore trust in the summary of his central thesis and it &apos;s this that seems to me pure f@@ uc@@ king .
The notion of gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Was humanity not generally enrich@@ ed ?
And this en@@ rich added to an increase in the population is the real political question today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ ai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without doubt .
But remember that she only has 17 years .
An age that most people are just starting to find their place in the world .
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the young gir@@ l and she will find her path to lead a happy life .
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that col@@ oured per@@ ver@@ ts are the inc@@ ar@@ nation of the evil .
All my best wishes in Mal@@ ala , but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working neigh@@ bor@@ hoods of Britain !
Some@@ body thought his speech was a bit strange .
She than@@ ked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that , if she was not where she is now , she would have been married at 14 .
Is Mal@@ ala itself not part of these &quot; col@@ or@@ ful &quot; per@@ ver@@ ts ?
You should have no &quot; an@@ ten@@ na time &quot; on this site .
You are , yourself , a horri@@ ble perverse .
It &apos;s absolutely revol@@ ting .
No , his father w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be sh@@ it at 14 .
She was 15 years old .
His father leads a school where girls are in school and he is in favor of equal rights for women .
It is , and has always been , to get a higher education and that she has the right to decide herself for her marriage .
But it &apos;s someone unusual in Pakistan , because he thinks that women are equal to men .
What she said is that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 years , without having her say .
S@@ or@@ ry that she did not express it sufficiently eloqu@@ ently for you .
It may seem like a contradiction , but maybe she would say that if her father did not give her freedom , she would have been married at 14 years old .
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange , which obviously has a bit of trouble finding his so@@ y character of Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ tri@@ ich .
I just looked at the two modern seas@@ ons that are quite different but I have to admit that it &apos;s one of the best series of horror , one of the most successful ones !
A fascin@@ ating first episo@@ de .
The achievement is close to perfec@@ tion and J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange &apos;s show s@@ inging the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on Mar@@ s de Bo@@ o@@ ie is simply over@@ turning .
I ha@@ ven &apos;t yet watched this new season ( which will be the last for me , without a bo@@ f beef ) .
In the case of American .
But one thing is on , outside of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange Ex@@ cep@@ t , it &apos;s especially the risks of scenes and of the mountains that take me .
In A@@ H@@ S , we have an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans that makes it quite ridiculous that today &apos;s produc@@ tions are se@@ ated .
It escap@@ es me a little to see you throwing the spon@@ ge in advance for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting to be able to give them quality .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange is certainly a pillar of this series but , you say so so well , there are many other things still .
No , it &apos;s simply that for me J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange ( and especially his path and the way she uses it ) is really U@@ N of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities .
And well , I look a lot for her .
Then I think the series is written , she wants to do too much at the same time .
The season 3 was slightly below , in the 2 it was too dis@@ per@@ sed despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I don &apos;t see them making 10 seas@@ ons from American . H@@ or@@ ry St@@ or@@ y or it will end like 24 hours .
But everyone does what they want e@@ h !
It &apos;s by what I say &quot; I &apos;@@ ll no longer watch &quot; that everyone is forced to do the same !
I simply share my point of view nothing more , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange , J@@ E thinks she will be fatal .
But then , it &apos;s just my opinion .
Let &apos;s talk less about tax increases , please - let &apos;s go in government spending .
No , increase spending please .
Those who wanted to sab@@ otage spending failed .
De@@ fin@@ ing controversy about relatively small spending positions , like development aid
The problem is that it represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for and for all that time some , in each camp , pretend that these nu@@ ances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them in bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of expenses .
&quot; debt &quot; is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country .
&quot; debt &quot; is nothing to worry about .
I would not see any problem with the government approaching a third of my income ( even before talking about taxes on consumption ) if I thought he would use it well .
But that &apos;s not the case , and many taxpayers have the same feeling .
We say that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age has not been completely honest about how to reduce taxes but well , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development assistance , Hi@@ gh S@@ p@@ é 2 , wind subsidies that are almost useless and nuclear power stations that cost the double of what they should have , you arrive at a figure that makes the tax of Lab@@ or and Li@@ b@@ -@@ De@@ m more ridiculous .
Your first £ 10 000 are not tax@@ able .
This means that someone who ear@@ ns $ 35 000 per year will pay about £ 5 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone with £ 50@@ ,000 would pay around £ 10 000 ( a fifth ) , etc . and someone with £ 200 , pay about £ 70 000 ( a little over a third ) .
And the social contributions ?
The more social security contributions , the more the local taxes , the more par@@ king fees and the car stic@@ ker , and it &apos;s before VAT .
Almost exactly 30 % of my money is collected at source before local taxes and car stic@@ kers .
I &apos;@@ m paid decent , but not extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant .
No , it &apos;s a problem , of course , I am happy to pay my taxes .
But let &apos;s not pretend to believe that the money falls from the sky , or that it is not important to know where billions of taxes pass .
How can an unemployed unemployed person prove it ?
Even though , 20 % of the unemployed w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t seek , that means that 80 % are looking and don &apos;t find .
Since I am unemployed , do I have any interest in the others trying or not ?
That a potential recru@@ it@@ er receives 10 or 20 C@@ V , that bo@@ thers my chances .
Ac@@ tually , I have not had any news from Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i for months , does that mean agents are more occupied with inspection operations than really getting job announ@@ cements ?
I don &apos;t see the interest .
Because it &apos;s not up to the State to provide work .
If Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i does not provide enough positions , then we have to do without Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i .
What is this a sensitive subject ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case we ensure that the unemployed do their homework well in return for their rights .
Just as a contro@@ ller asks their transport title to users of a means of transportation , a service bos@@ s or employees of their work , etc .
Nobody sh@@ outs scandal in these cases , right ?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights : the only two times when I had a case at Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i , my rights to the ARE had been poorly established , and on one of the issues , am@@ pu@@ t@@ é 40 % , it was necessary to fight hard .
It takes some time !
I &apos;@@ m not an expert in law .
M@@ ast@@ er and control take the upper hand at the moment , while stat@@ eless Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i is close to being , actually , an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees , they are the ones who pay for the con@@ ti@@ sts .
Un@@ employed policies and French people give themselves rights that they do not actually have !
It &apos;s not normal .
I would add that a worthy unemployment insurance is part of the recovery of paid work .
More than waiting for mur@@ der@@ ous tw@@ e@@ ets in Arab@@ ic ...
In reality , there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop I@@ sis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would look like the spread of the black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with the war and the movement of people at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is had the spirit to ban H@@ ad@@ j in M@@ ec@@ ca this year to Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms from the three countries affected .
El P@@ ay reports that 7 400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent tri@@ ps .
In fact there was the case of a pil@@ gri@@ m coming from Bosnia who contr@@ acted the vari@@ ation to M@@ ec@@ ca during the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m coming from Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit of spirit .
Are you without any heart than proposing to prevent E@@ bo@@ a sick of taking an aircraft for Europe ?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those &quot; who know &quot; decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people ...
These West African countries where E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be placed in strict quar@@ ant@@ ine .
Nobody comes out .
Only health workers can enter .
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can go .
If they contract the E@@ bol@@ a virus while they are there , they stay there until they are cu@@ red .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Only last week , people were infected after having had contacts with people in West Africa even though they took &quot; all necessary precautions &quot; .
We can stop the progress of this disease .
It spre@@ ads mainly by the airlines .
Let &apos;s prohibit them from offering them ste@@ al to these countries .
Moreover , customs agents in airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of É@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be immediately put into quar@@ ant@@ ine .
That he can get the message from the first person and from the group ( including religious ) second and he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt he is able to erec@@ t a dogma the image of God characterized by the total cor@@ ners of the planet operating .
It &apos;s still far from this conception .
It &apos;s only been for 20 years that the information has appeared like the given premium of humanity , while religion , derived from the brain , runs our actions since Lu@@ cy maybe .
What is the point of becoming yet another Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who di@@ dn &apos;t notice it , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely minority in France today , no one is forced to join .
Those who critici@@ ze do not in any case put foot to the Church , only to see the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France .
What is the next step , take away the notion of sin , too &quot; an@@ xi@@ gen &quot; ?
@ rent : S@@ or@@ ry the church does not have a limited vision for France .
And in the world , it may be possible to touch more people ...
@ Mar@@ ine E , to be honest ( as usual ) the respect of others as you see it pre@@ existed at the ch@@ ris@@ t .
H@@ ill@@ el a century before telling him : &quot; do not do others what you don &apos;t want us to do , that &apos;s the whole Tor@@ ah and the rest is only comment : go and study ! &quot; .
Christianity goes much beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the ag@@ ony .
Your &quot; advance justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity &quot; but without God ?
It &apos;s a return to communism ? : - )
Next step : we remove inc@@ ar@@ nation and resur@@ rec@@ tion .
Je@@ sus will remain this her@@ o who shocked moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be ready to play their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity .
Not very Catholic ?
I think I remember that the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France is mainly due to the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated then converted from strength and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago .
I don &apos;t hesitate to buy that , the new A@@ li@@ en game , or W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 .
And the new E@@ li@@ te game comes soon .
It doesn &apos;t worry .
Personally I would choose S@@ M .
I like W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 ( I even participated in his campaign of raising funds ) but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s worth £ 30 .
If it &apos;s the P@@ C version that interests you , Green M@@ an G@@ am@@ ping is currently selling S@@ M at 30 £ and also offers a good reduction of 20 % .
Gre@@ en M@@ an G@@ am@@ ping currently sel@@ ls S@@ M at 30 £ and also offers a good 20 % reduction .
I &apos;@@ m going to watch .
Of course not at work .
The joy of the computer department is blocking all the sites .
H@@ ell@@ o , is it £ 30 and then 20 % reduction , or does the 30 £ include the 20 % reduction ?
Be@@ ware , however : the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
I bought it by surprise , I bought it , but can &apos;t play it .
Also , I bought it on Ste@@ am , so no reimbursement , that &apos;s bad .
It &apos;s time to buy a new video card * do the gu@@ y *
It &apos;s a Brazilian site , but you get a valid S@@ team valid , I think .
C@@ la@@ vel emp@@ tor and all this : I di@@ dn &apos;t use it myself .
Ama@@ z@@ on £ 30 for P@@ C , 35 £ for X@@ box 3@@ 60 and P@@ S@@ 3 , £ 44 for X@@ box and P@@ S@@ 4
Thank you , I would be afraid that one day they would remove it from your libr@@ ary if they decide to cr@@ ack down on people who buy it there while they are outside the planned region .
So look at the be@@ ta version of El@@ ite : D@@ ang@@ er@@ re .
So , was France in 19@@ 40 a &quot; pu@@ ri@@ que ter@@ minal &quot; ?
So , this Nobel Prize seems to me a pois@@ oned gift .
You need to love France of 40 , the France of &quot; the strange defeat &quot; ?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature we wonder if P@@ rou@@ st or Do@@ to@@ y@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
The Nobel Prize is not even an event , we do not even want to read the pri@@ zed authors .
Brazili@@ ans , Chinese or Austr@@ ali@@ ans will read Mo@@ di@@ ano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes a uni@@ verse that is so limited and if you get involved ?
I hope the other no@@ ses are more credible but frankly I doubt it .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , L@@ y , Mus@@ s@@ o has only a distant relationship with literature .
Did you read at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
It would be better to judge .
As for the Chinese , Brazili@@ ans and others , don &apos;t worry for them .
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture , they are .
They will appreciate .
Mo@@ di@@ ano with its fair value , if they don &apos;t know it already !
On your side , continue to attend L@@ é@@ y and Mus@@ s@@ o .
I share your opinion .
Mar@@ c Le@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me Mus@@ s@@ o all have their chances .
So let &apos;s see who got the Nobel Prize winner : H@@ .
P@@ lay in 2005 , D@@ .
S@@ top the awful .
Since I conducted one in Iceland , I don &apos;t stop seeing K@@ ia S@@ ports everywhere .
I think this thing has followed me up to now .
Maybe she wants to cr@@ ush me ?
Or sw@@ allow me like the horri@@ ble computer of Super@@ man III ?
H@@ ell@@ o Dan@@ a , always hate ?
H@@ ell@@ o D@@ Q - no , not today , I took my med@@ als .
It &apos;s Wednesday !
I had a few days of rest .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the party of beer and the ci@@ der of Nov@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was sh@@ it .
I managed to disgu@@ ise 19 different be@@ ers , W@@ ob@@ bl@@ y We@@ af@@ t being one of my fav@@ or@@ ites .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mix@@ ture of people there , there was not only some of those fana@@ tics ( not to be confused with the fana@@ tics of the cam@@ era ) .
Con@@ clu@@ sion on the return of Sunday was really hard .
Monday night we went to the grand@@ father of a friend to play the ni@@ n br@@ ush .
Thanks to a real chance of beginning , I was able to go back with several decent ones .
I hope that if I arrive at 95 years I &apos;@@ ll be as lively as him .
Yesterday evening I went to a bo@@ c co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my drinks arrived with a slic@@ e of l@@ ard on it .
I ad@@ mire him .
Lis@@ ten a little Bou@@ d@@ d@@ ha and you will understand how wrong you are , dear Christian .
Having said that , without wanting to anno@@ y you , I think you &apos;@@ re moving away a little from the subject .
This famous total is banning the qu@@ ests for ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts at the end of the mo@@ squ@@ es .
It immediately points out arms trafficking .
Either we have the big eyes open like Med@@ de@@ b and Tai@@ ha or Bou@@ b@@ aker or we have a big eyes closed .
You have to choose .
It &apos;s not by keeping the eyes closed that we &apos;@@ re gaining light .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , dear Christian , but once again , you make a monu@@ mental counter-@@ point : the entire authorities , organisations or representative associations , Muslim or not , having formally condemned the IS and its crimes , the French , Muslims or not , have nothing to add to these official official convictions .
Who does not say a word about it .
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims , Arabs or Africans .
Not like French people .
Unfortunately , dear K@@ en@@ ch , Mer@@ v@@ el , doubts exist for everyone .
As I said a thousand times , there are doubts about the approval by the Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be fool@@ ish and in@@ decent to accuse them of them pri@@ ori and demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt .
In my opinion , this principle is the denial of the re@@ public and can only help to un@@ lock French society .
There is no doubt , so to say .
Who does not say word , but what do they do ?
Con@@ tent to a proximity with E@@ I or the conviction of E@@ I .
The silence is very practical , it &apos;s the main weapon of those who want to leave the go@@ at and the k@@ nees .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but pragmatic .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , during elections , &quot; take reven@@ ge &quot; from the parties represented in West@@ min@@ ster because a huge gap has increased between their proposals for dev@@ olution and what they promised in the run-up to the referendum on independence .
Cameron must be che@@ ated at the idea of losing all these seats in West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must lau@@ gh .
What are these threats ?
The Conservatives are completely f@@ uc@@ king out of Scotland since they have no basis .
They can do what they want with electoral impunity .
I don &apos;t think that even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Lab@@ or losing seats in West@@ min@@ ster in favor of the S@@ N@@ P is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives .
Who will give a gun for the Lab@@ or Party .
They will be fully eliminated in Scotland by the S@@ N@@ P and U@@ K@@ IP that will cut their head in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ and join@@ s the &quot; P@@ RO@@ M@@ ES@@ SE &quot; thinking that he saved his party but without realized that he signed the death stop of his Scottish MPs .
No surprise that some Labour de@@ pu@@ ties ask their leader to account .
If the S@@ N@@ P ear@@ ns 20-@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives , they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force the Conservatives and the Lab@@ or to do what they promised for maximum dev@@ olution .
I think it &apos;s rather important .
Not if the Lab@@ or or the Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected one day in England .
To quote the 8 % p@@ um@@ ps at the expense of 85 % is not a great electoral strategy .
Also , once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on subjects that concern England , Conservatives will win all the votes .
O@@ h , I think well that he is .
Cameron may not have much to lose , but M@@ ili@@ band .
Mag@@ gi@@ a did it with the Ul@@ ster Uni@@ onists and it was successful .
But he is still in lic@@ k to be prime minister in 2015 and this since he won the Lab@@ or Party leadership .
So , in short , these bo@@ xes will be virtually behind each read@@ er to look over his shoulder and see what he says , how he reads , and until the end .
It &apos;s &quot; the life of others &quot; from East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B applied to the world of the F@@ R@@ I@@ C ...
Still the same fasc@@ ination for surveillance techniques .
In the end , it will have a ster@@ ile effect .
I wait for the next ticket : Ama@@ z@@ on fab@@ ric@@ s V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E book according to V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E profile and it automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of his secret !
It &apos;s like the world .
For@@ give it .
Thanks for the article .
As under this system , the management of D@@ R@@ M@@ s is not im@@ printed , it leaves me with the reading of ha@@ c@@ ked files , books from the public domain or bought with a few ed@@ itors who have the intelligence to offer files without a lot .
Given the price I paid for the K@@ ob@@ o , it &apos;s without regret .
I &apos;@@ m ast@@ ounded about the widespread ab@@ dic@@ ation of users in the face of the widespread ownership of their privacy .
You will systematically notice in your general public release that everyone gives his loyalty card ( f@@ an * c , * * i@@ ere , ... ) .
There are also demanding ma@@ ster@@ pieces whose opening and completion rates are probably pal@@ try .
For example , &quot; Fin@@ ne@@ g@@ ans W@@ ake &quot; from James .
@ Thomas : In the age of Bi@@ g Data , the data doesn &apos;t really need to be personal to be relevant .
Please be careful not to put all the literature in the same ba@@ g .
The collection of an@@ onymous data when there is a profile ...
The harvest is not an@@ onymous .
These are the data published by K@@ ob@@ o who are , allowing neither the read@@ ers nor the authors to identify .
But K@@ ob@@ o has all this information , he .
There have been so many exaggerated , er@@ ron@@ eous and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a nur@@ ser@@ y class full of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic sh@@ it .
It &apos;s even worse than that if you take into account Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism .
It &apos;s interesting that some of Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s supporters think that Islamic is such an insult that they remove your comment , but not mine . ; - )
Well seen : -@@ P But Turkey does not want to sho@@ ot a ball in the foot , unless you gain anything .
If it attack I@@ SIS , I@@ SIS will come back , so it &apos;s indeed a bul@@ let in the foot .
A retirement diplom@@ at writ@@ es on his blo@@ g : &quot; The A@@ P reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to over@@ throw the Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad because it would jeopardise Israel &apos;s security .
It &apos;s not clear in the article if Iran was sending a serious warning of re@@ tribu@@ tion or if it simply advis@@ ed caution .
This second option is more likely and , in any case , what really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria , Israel and the security of the region .
Indi@@ an P@@ un@@ ch@@ line &apos;s reading is to strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than the * n@@ ann@@ ies balanced by the traditional media . The short article you give is important and should be read , bearing in mind the previous realistic / warnings comments coming from Iran around 1979 - 1980 .
Who are these &quot; moder@@ ates &quot; who seriously oppose the horri@@ ble secular Assad and at the same time the per@@ ver@@ ts of I@@ SIS ?
The pipelines policy is pushing the world toward the ab@@ ys@@ s and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent &quot; moder@@ ates &quot; to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War .
&quot; It &apos;s even worse than that if you take into account Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism &quot; Are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?
I have one in mind .
There should be a N@@ u@@ rem@@ berg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks .
&quot; need &quot; ?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being alive again ?
A little late for that , my friend ...
Are criminals not barely old now , like 120 years ?
A little late for that , no ?
Par@@ tly about the tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate of the C@@ U@@ P that planned and led the genocide , Tal@@ a@@ at and D@@ j@@ em@@ al killed just after the 1@@ st World War by the Armen@@ ians , and En@@ ver killed by the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks in a p@@ acked place of Central Asia at the same time , when there went there while dre@@ aming of building a Turkish empire .
What a cra@@ zy !
An impressive ma@@ ster@@ y of the s@@ ism of the fatal pen@@ te , but apart from that , we &apos;@@ re looking in vain for contact with real ones .

F@@ les@@ bian couples can simply be a child &apos;s desire and not a desire to be accepted .

What a shame to designate them as future psychological im@@ balanced .
One day , they will have the age to defend themselves , say that they are happy to live , earn a living and pay for the retirement of this lad@@ y ( ? )
The G@@ PA is probably a &quot; temporary &quot; solution in the evolution of the medicine that our world is experiencing .

The important thing here is that this practice is fram@@ ed so that the body &apos;s &quot; commerci@@ alization &quot; is limited .

There are only Christians and beli@@ ever@@ s who refuse these practices ...

I think that in the sports section there is an article on the so@@ cc@@ er waiting for your comments .
Sup@@ er article , very true .
Since the film of Tony Par@@ son , there is a lack of reporting that really reflects the reality of the culture of the north of England .
No surprise that Paul Ma@@ son has understood the social and political context properly , he understands things well .
The Northern Northern is still alive , but it has been v@@ am@@ pi@@ fied by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon .
That said , you can write a ear if you are in the region of London in November : 9@@ 9@@ p@@ sou@@ l is going to go through some sou@@ ls , including full Northern Northern , on Saturday 15 November in B@@ et@@ se@@ y Tro@@ t@@ wo@@ od at Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
I also thought &quot; always the same story &quot; , but this is a small written article and well thought out .
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive .

The business is becoming increasingly pois@@ on@@ ous .
The Palestinians have no partner for peace .
Unfortunately , Netanyahu never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace .
@ J@@ on@@ a@@ than : Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy occupy people ( by the way , it was also the case of R@@ ab@@ in ) .
It &apos;s obvious that R@@ ab@@ in , Netanyahu and their elec@@ tors all preferred the occup@@ at@@ s-@@ colon@@ ization to peace .
He took out his clo@@ thes , the posts on the ro@@ ck and enter the water .
An Israeli had stolen him .
The Israeli representative gets angry and vo@@ ci@@ f@@ a : &quot; What are you talking about ?
The Israelis were not even there at the time ! &quot;
The Palestinian representative ( UN ) s@@ mile and add : and now that things are clearly established

This proves that you don &apos;t understand what Ru@@ s@@ ell B@@ and says , or what No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky says .
It &apos;s just a continuation of personal attacks and ins@@ in@@ u@@ ations ( my 13@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l likes it well , which would mean that it &apos;s a question of im@@ maturity ) .
A really vicious charge , with just a suspicion of awareness that Ru@@ s@@ ell B@@ and says some tru@@ ths , maybe tru@@ ths that we prefer not to think .
G@@ et back , this feeling will be more and more common !
I can understand why Br@@ and horri@@ fies some : he sometimes speaks pre@@ ten@@ tious and after all the absur@@ dities of the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids it does indeed give the impression of being a beg@@ in@@ nings , but this whole story of not voting has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my opinion .
The general consensus seems to be that it just says to people not to vote and instead to cross arms and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview of Pa@@ x@@ man and other articles / vide@@ os he posted , he said that voting once every 5 years only for the Lab@@ or or the Conservatives ( or the Li@@ b As@@ ks I suppose ) and limit the democratic commitment to that is completely useless .
I &apos;@@ m not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution ( because I think that being politically active by submitting his applications can go hand in hand with voting , since politicians are gi@@ g@@ ab@@ ul@@ ating that will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections ) , but it &apos;s cra@@ zy to see all these con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding responses that say that Je@@ sus makes Je@@ sus say to the young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will go better .
His solution is extremely deb@@ at@@ able and it would be good if people were to debate what he really said rather than just label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left for account .
Yes , thank you .
The thing about the vote was completely mis@@ represented .
The useless need to sli@@ de a bul@@ le@@ tin in a ballot every 5 years anno@@ ys me deeply , seeing that my vote does not really count for anything .
I want more referendums , the electronic vote , direct democracy and MPs who report to their voters at home .
Also , I dispute the idea that the words of Ru@@ s@@ ell B@@ and are not the ones ( written by others ) .
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas , even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-@@ establishment thin@@ kers and aca@@ dem@@ ists from counter-@@ culture that Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e would like to group under the &quot; p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ist &quot; label .
I &apos;@@ m rather convinced that in a debate he would manage to convince Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e .
Maybe it &apos;s what the Gu@@ ard@@ an could do , that Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e does like Pol@@ ly To@@ y@@ be@@ e and interview Ru@@ s@@ ell on a v@@ er@@ anda , even with the head@@ ac@@ he of heads added to the show !
Like Ma@@ x K@@ ele@@ er , who at first attacked Ru@@ s@@ sel but ended up becoming one of his f@@ ans and invite him in his program , it &apos;s too easy to attack it without really understanding where he wants to come .
He has a political dis@@ course that has existed for generations , but which has been margin@@ alized by the traditional media - including the Gu@@ ard@@ an - for generations .
This &quot; fron@@ tal &quot; reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the history of the history where professional histor@@ ians have become a minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become poorer for the benefit of con@@ den@@ sed pre@@ d@@ é@@ d@@ é type P@@ o for press documents .
For my part I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ e@@ u as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need to attack a cul@@ pri@@ t , a scapego@@ at .
They develop both of the very rational reasoning , but this ration@@ ality is based on these scapego@@ ats that are the ke@@ y@@ stone of their thinking .
I think that for F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult the state was essential as guilty .
This is a very ar@@ cha@@ ic thought , the thinking behind it , which is also mag@@ ical .
We solve the problem of the relationship with the other by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ ist , neo-@@ li@@ b and / or liber@@ tarian pen@@ te ( both terms the second brand a hard@@ lin@@ er of the desire to eradicate the state , the first knowing to look for the state &apos;s help for its markets ) in the sense of the least state / not at all state at F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult .
The old dream of the base self-@@ organizing itself .
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state : without this guilt , she does not stand up .
Who says guilty , says elimination , murder , sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here .
Neither support nor support .
The totalitarian left remember the good old time , that of his go@@ d then , Stalin , the small father of the people .
O@@ ul@@ ala , you probably read a ch@@ ick too fast if you took F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult &apos;s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apo@@ logy of K@@ home@@ in@@ ly .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ ent would not am@@ used to attack Michel by this means ...
G@@ au@@ to put a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective , on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether we agree or not with him is an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
Se@@ eing this cab@@ in or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by scientists in the human sciences of the hard left who do not bear that we &apos;@@ re going from al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ as , is quite ridiculous .
The nar@@ c@@ iss@@ is@@ me and the author@@ itarianism of these people are without limits .
An important point to add seems to me to be the post of these &quot; rebels &quot; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of Chinese and other &quot; y@@ el@@ low &quot; I &apos;@@ ve seen in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You di@@ dn &apos;t have the pleasure of hearing our friends from Australia on this subject , then .
And where was it in Russia , that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I don &apos;t remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time .
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia here - in the 9@@ 0s last time , in a market .
Chinese people think the same of white people !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou a long time ago , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them making a viol@@ ently anti-@@ B@@ lan@@ k statements .
My father is not happy that his el@@ usive daughter is like a B@@ lan@@ c .
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990 &apos;s and especially in recent years : they are becoming more and more rich , prosperity is spreading outside of big cities , and thanks to this prosperity , people travel abroad and see how the others live .
From what I was told , the Russians mainly have prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia , who work in professions and in areas where they have a lot of chance of being exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence .
Although I lived on the banks of the I@@ en@@ is@@ se@@ i river , in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
Unfortunately , I heard the opinions of the Austr@@ ali@@ ans on the Chinese and the Ab@@ original .
It &apos;s really we@@ ir@@ d that a foreign@@ er tells me that I don &apos;t support the Chinese , when I met two in my life ( one abroad ) , did not keep bad memories , all people are worth it and , in fact , those in London were very good that &apos;s the only reason I remembered they were Chinese .
Otherwise we don &apos;t remember who we meet , all people are worth it , how to remember who was who was .
Do you know what is we@@ ir@@ d ?
That you and the other Russian are talking about Chinese as a kind of unique fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attr@@ action in a zo@@ o .
And yet you always come with this B@@ lan@@ c .
How many Chinese men are with white people , by comparison ?
No , because there is a lot of chances that the parents of these B@@ lan@@ ches will attack them PH@@ Y@@ I@@ Q@@ U@@ ME@@ N@@ T .
No measure of the fairness of justice .
However , it &apos;s the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipul@@ ated by groups strongly left on the left like the union of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate ...
@ March : sorry , but the judicial circles are frankly brand right .
When the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate , he only returns 25 % of judges .
If a measure of its bias can be made from the rela@@ tivity of the application of laws in the courts , it orders to remove two obstacles .
The one from the political vision of the observer like that of the judge &apos;s current interpretation .
Then there is the necessary tool of the law to re@@ focus the evaluation on the basi@@ cs .
The measure of its in@@ observed in all the judicial acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , including including , forces to distinguish between the error and the bias of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates .
It would be useless to claim that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups .
The claim and the lack of knowledge do not fall within an objective analysis .
And if all of this is not analysed , how can we say that justice improves in France ?
If it is only by statistics revealing implic@@ itly that it is part of the lowest .
The previous preamble allows for a good record of what follows in the third ratio .
One of the corruption * of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate .
R@@ emo@@ ving a sensitive proportion of the nu@@ is@@ ance power * which is given to the judicial institution capable of such a he@@ res@@ y .
The area considered is that of the * of he@@ irs committed until the way of fraud in the procedure * by the following success@@ ors man@@ dated by no@@ tar@@ ies .
This profession gets a good year of 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage * guaranteed by the virtual judicial impunity * French no@@ te@@ volunte@@ er .
For the understanding of their mechanism , a part has been reported in the comments following the first publication .
Where it join@@ s the so-called statistical improvement * moderate by the previous comment , it is that the judicial institution has produced , in many differences between gener@@ al@@ og@@ ist and he@@ irs who are reluctant to do so as such , a whole series of cases that are contrary to all the laws fav@@ oring the he@@ irs .
Does the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria is not a form of a form drawn up of lying ?
Surely totally prohibi@@ tive prices .
Again equipment to sc@@ am the disabled .
We can say that , but my bro@@ ther has one of these tri@@ ps every field , built on measure to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal whe@@ el@@ chair , with whe@@ el@@ works and con@@ ge@@ tful ty@@ res , could not .
Like you say , taste and col@@ ors ...
The T@@ an@@ k@@ nec@@ ri looks like Je@@ rey C@@ lar@@ k@@ son could invent for a challenge in To@@ p Ge@@ ar .
The T@@ an@@ k@@ ch@@ air looks EP@@ L@@ EU .
I think that the creat@@ or of the W@@ h@@ ill never had to clean a dog cross on a sh@@ it .
I am sure that my s@@ ister would love the tri@@ cycle every field , but it &apos;s simply too expensive .
The whe@@ el@@ chair whe@@ el@@ chair of ul@@ tr@@ a long distance would be perfect for a disabled person with a pen@@ sion@@ er for the long run .
Here there are h@@ ills that would like them .
The prices actually seem high , but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bi@@ ke , so &quot; you see &quot; .
The tri@@ cycle every ground seems particularly useful to me .
All the disabled are not poor , however .
Many of them have at their disposal insurance of a reasonable amount .
Only if they became disabled .
The thing is that the whe@@ el@@ chair &apos;s market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know full well that they are necessary .
We can &apos;t really say that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
It &apos;s an example of excessive design .
Unfortunately it &apos;s just a ske@@ t@@ ch , it &apos;s not planned to make it .
I &apos;@@ m CO@@ NT@@ N@@ T that the whe@@ el@@ chair whe@@ el@@ ying &quot; long distance &quot; does not reach the market , because apparently there is no way to drive this thing .

Pri@@ primary and populist response
In fact we don &apos;t know what Mar@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see that ?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I &apos;@@ m not sure that Spe@@ e really &quot; refused &quot; to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ si@@ e in his book &quot; C@@ ast@@ les of Ste@@ el &quot; suggests that Spe@@ e quickly left the zone because he had received a report indicating a British k@@ id in the area .
The sea was heated at the beginning of the day ; I don &apos;t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle ?
Similarly , the fight ended after the sun s@@ ank , making any rescue operation more difficult .
Comp@@ are this with the next battle , the one of the Fal@@ ou@@ ines , where , on the photo@@ s showing the survi@@ v@@ ors being res@@ cu@@ ed , we see a sea calm and in full .
Moreover , res@@ cu@@ ers knew that there were no German fighters at this stage in the zone .
H@@ m@@ m , it doesn &apos;t really correspond to what I remember I read about this battle , so I did a quick research on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia :
&quot; A certain confusion was among the German ships about the fate of the two co@@ o@@ ked cro@@ o@@ ks , who had disappeared in the dark after having stopped the sho@@ oting , and a k@@ ne@@ e-@@ jer@@ k course .
The L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g lives something on fire , but by getting closer , he lives that it was only a wrec@@ k .
The N@@ ü@@ r@@ n@@ berg , slower than the other German ships , join@@ s the battle late and is living Le Mon@@ sheep , pen@@ ned and badly damaged but still on the movement .
After pointing out his spot@@ ters on the ship &apos;s flag , the proposal to go to the ship was refused and it opens the fire , eventually leaving the ship .
Without reliable information , von Spe@@ e judged that the Go@@ o@@ od H@@ ope had to escape and stopped the research at 10 : 15 .
Re@@ qu@@ et of reports showing a British co@@ o@@ king in the vic@@ inity , it is going to north .
So , if it &apos;s true , the Germans , let &apos;s try in the dark before the invention of the ra@@ d@@ ar , did not know that a ship had sun@@ k , and so could not look for survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also thought that there was a more important k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of the Ro@@ yal N@@ av@@ y in the zone that could have seriously damaged them , so in the confusion they disgu@@ sting to enjoy their advance .
They were far from their base and Spe@@ e was well aware that they should find a way through many vessels from the Ro@@ yal N@@ av@@ y .
C@@ ra@@ do@@ k &apos;s sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their am@@ muni@@ tion , condemning them when they were finally taken .
Several voices are raised at the U@@ M@@ P to ask that it be written into the law that a definitively convicted official be definitively in@@ eligible .
This is a courageous position , which would also affect elected representatives of the left .
But no@@ o@@ on , it &apos;s a jo@@ ke .

When does a trade union ban in sectors already protected ?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens ?
In@@ tro@@ lled by politicians ( ones ) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , which are always quick to am@@ pli@@ fy the very people who will enjoy their im@@ mobility to block the actions of real policies , which are really trying to get things moving , not the beautiful talk that im@@ mobili@@ zation is commensurate with their sufficiency .
I met them in the sub@@ way at noon with their small b@@ ann@@ ers &quot; for justice &quot; they came from province and did not make the difference between Ber@@ cy and P@@ P@@ P@@ B .
She supports the existence of politici@@ zed unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of her party .
She w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t defend the same the@@ ories if the right-wing , even extreme right-wing unions referred to the target of person@@ alities on his side and led against a judicial and media war .
Your statements are completely free .
If , right now , the right is missing the legal news , it &apos;s simply that she has committed facts that are covered !
We don &apos;t have an example of a left-wing person who had so much to do with the justice but all those who were the subject of his attention did not have a fav@@ orable treatment .
On the other hand it must be remembered that the union of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate who is on the left is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and that he is a minority .
That a minister supports the unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be .
@ M@@ FR The union that you mention is perhaps a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but its influence is great at the Chan@@ cell@@ ie , it &apos;s not a secret .
We now wonder if the &quot; mission &quot; of some judges is not more s@@ ali@@ r rather than educated .
@ gu@@ ys - You should be satisfied , the S@@ M is a minority .
What do you complain about ?
@ Pi@@ ve@@ ine : you forget that the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates are not civil servants like the others : they are the only ones to have the power to indic@@ t and inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ate everyone .

I think that even the most star@@ ving deb@@ it of gl@@ ory realized that X@@ -@@ F@@ ac@@ tor can only mean the end of a career , so I &apos;@@ d be surprised if someone accepts their offer .

And worse than ridiculous : it sets a completely artificial distance between the western public and the studied people - a distance that quickly comes to racism , because the sac@@ ra@@ bly eth@@ no@@ log@@ ists present us these far-@@ off people as infin@@ itely super@@ sti@@ dy and full of rit@@ ual bi@@ kes , while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired , like ours , of practical considerations everyday .

It would bring a do@@ se of healthy mode@@ sty .
Your contempt for ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists is completely unjustified !

If the F@@ O@@ M has chosen not to show these images is only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot .
If the F@@ O@@ M had wanted to protect the pil@@ ots , it would have left the ba@@ p because at the same time as another vehicle ( deb@@ ilit@@ ating for example ) was on the loo@@ p .
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typ@@ ho@@ on that we knew was coming , but for which the F@@ O@@ M did not see fit to advance the time of departure ( TV law , pu@@ b , money ... ) .

There were lots of con@@ spir@@ acies in F@@ 1 , but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of a pilot victory at the expense of another .
It &apos;s not F@@ O@@ M that comes out of the ba@@ it because it &apos;s the F@@ I@@ F .
size of size .
In view of the am@@ ate@@ ur images , the lack of image helps the F@@ I@@ F to avoid the troub@@ les@@ ome questions of the type : How is it that the Commissioner has a green flag in full intervention and continue to do it after the accident ( see the complete video after the accident )
No , it &apos;s not because the video is deemed too violent that the F@@ I@@ F is blocking images of the accident but because we clearly see one of the Commissioners acting a green flag , a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are more under a y@@ el@@ low flag .
Some comments show a dark knowledge of the F@@ 1 .
Yes , dear E@@ yours , the race is no longer under a y@@ el@@ low flag . O@@ R@@ ES the place of the accident , hence the green flag .
This is the usual procedure .
The position of comm@@ is@@ aries just down@@ stream of the accident ( depending on the case , it may be 10 me@@ ters like at 100@@ me@@ ters after the accident ) ag@@ ged the green to tell the pil@@ ots to resume a normal pace .

And the sex , let &apos;s not forget sex , the fear of not having a sexual life , the pu@@ b and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life .
The inf@@ o do exactly the same thing .
Ma@@ ke bu@@ z@@ z with inf@@ o that we really don &apos;t need to care about is just to continue to sc@@ are people so they can continue to control them .
&quot; When t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids are tou@@ ching on E@@ bol@@ a , we &apos;@@ re all appealing for fear &quot; It should be &quot; der@@ ail@@ ing &quot; , not &quot; all &quot; .
Given the medical reference , &quot; tou@@ ching &quot; is much better said in this context than &quot; der@@ ail@@ ing &quot; .
I wonder if all the people who care that E@@ bol@@ a could start to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution ?
You do too much honour .
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that E@@ bol@@ a is just one of the signs of the apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic that approaches .
E@@ bol@@ a is An@@ ten@@ ch@@ ris@@ t !
You &apos;@@ re confusing E@@ bol@@ a and Mur@@ do@@ ch ...
Sup@@ er article , thank you !
A short and conc@@ ise article that makes a la@@ ugh@@ ing stock of this des@@ pic@@ able p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ journ@@ alism .
It made me lau@@ gh .
It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism towards it .
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently sc@@ ary and sc@@ ared ( without getting into hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to get us to get out when it needs .
I think it &apos;s perfectly logical that if we have to suffer a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack , why not have a crisis in E@@ bol@@ a in the absence of any proven cases ?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself invented .
Is there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations for this post , and to be still in this world almost 35 years later .
At the beginning it had to be horri@@ ble , given the context of the 198@@ 0-@@ 90 years .
I &apos;@@ m stupid , live with the certainty to spend it for years ... .@@ .
Very useless pat@@ ron@@ age .
As always when we talk about science .
Not only does the testi@@ monies serve nothing : taken in isolation , they can &apos;t serve scientific material .
But they have a harmful influence on objective appreciation of the facts .
@ traffic : testi@@ monies can &apos;t serve scientific material .
Maybe that &apos;s why we abstain from asking patients in psy@@ chi@@ atric patients when we have reliable comments from loved ones .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric file mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t mother explains that I was educated tele@@ phones by her mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
This is therefore an objective symptoms .
When I say that it &apos;s the crow@@ d , it is a subjec@@ tive testi@@ mony without significance .
A@@ h , because the at@@ te@@ station of a fact ( = here this testi@@ mony , which testi@@ fies to the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments ) is useless in a scientific process ?
What do you base the research on ?
On fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es ?
Do you put fant@@ asy the@@ ories and facts on the same level ( which give rise to veri@@ fiable testi@@ monies ) ?
&quot; Re@@ si@@ lic@@ ence &quot; : the ph@@ ony word a@@ ul@@ led by grand@@ mothers , J@@ -@@ L Del@@ ar@@ ue &apos;s f@@ ans , who take themselves for big psycho@@ log@@ ists after reading D dis@@ appears .
@ J@@ im : There are lots of p@@ iz@@ za pieces of meaning in the psycho@@ s .
C@@ yr@@ ul@@ ni@@ k did us the blow of &quot; resili@@ ence &quot; .
Because it &apos;s a great scienti@@ st , C@@ yr@@ ul@@ ni@@ k , I hope he will have bri@@ b@@ bed a reliable measure to quanti@@ fy it , this famous resili@@ ence .
I wonder if the air services could all save us from Far@@ age and company ? ?
Does that not make you think of Te@@ am America ?
Ser@@ iously , it &apos;s * not * a good idea to bring the Single Stu@@ dies out ...
And why ?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out are aware of it !
Let &apos;s leave our sal@@ t to the all-@@ powerful who can do mirac@@ les .
But how will they do so for children to c@@ rown ?
The only solution that comes to mind is hum@@ orous hum@@ or , which would kill the series .
It was already a series for children .
The children were c@@ iting .
A@@ h , because it &apos;s a series of children ?
US@@ K@@ IP work for the My@@ ster@@ ons .
K@@ e@@ ep your Te@@ am America .
Al@@ ways in Sup@@ marriages ?
It won &apos;t be the same if you don &apos;t see the s@@ ons and the anim@@ ation is well done . : - )
I look forward to seeing this ( although being an adult ) , but I hope it will give the idea to a channel to spread the old ones .
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia . It &apos;s been 40 years since we have episo@@ des of an hour on Saturday and Sunday at 0@@ 6 .
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago , it is on one of the second-@@ order commercial channels and we can always see it at these times .
And in addition the episo@@ des of half an hour now go to 05 : 30 , from Monday to Friday !
I agree , I &apos;@@ m probably a &quot; sad &quot; gu@@ y of 60 years , but I don &apos;t look at this series every day !
There &apos;s no &quot; Mon@@ t of the temp@@ le &quot; in or under the mo@@ s@@ que of es@@ plan@@ ades ! ! !
The radical Z@@ ion@@ ists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colon@@ ize Jerusalem .
Moreover , all the Israeli sear@@ ches below and around the mo@@ s@@ que of est@@ ates for several decades have not helped to find .
The me@@ ta of the temp@@ le if it is there is elsewhere .
Maybe in Argentina ? ?
This gu@@ y is not being sought for the simple reason that it &apos;s the col@@ or on which the mo@@ s@@ s@@ ad of the mo@@ s@@ que was built .
His summit , or d@@ rown of the Ro@@ cher , is lying in the middle of Om@@ ar &apos;s mo@@ s@@ que .
For Muslims , Mu@@ ham@@ mad went to parad@@ ise from this ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it &apos;s M@@ a M@@ ori@@ ah where A@@ bra@@ ham fail to sacrifice his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
As soon as she was taken and cont@@ ex@@ tu@@ alized , there is no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also has its extremists , it is worth rec@@ alling it regularly , and they are unfortunately rela@@ yed to the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i Ben@@ net , A@@ Vi@@ g@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Netanyahu , he accepted the plan to 2 states , and he constantly raised it ! ) .
It &apos;s also good to show how much the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact .
Can God recognize his own ?
The shor@@ test Jewish jo@@ ke : &quot; God is lau@@ ded ! &quot;
To bo@@ ast about tourism in Israel , we often show young half na@@ ï@@ ve naive people , al@@ an@@ gu@@ ies on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usual , much different from what the publicity shows us , as we can see on the pho@@ to that exemp@@ li@@ fies the article .
It &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary anyway .
And this pho@@ to is a wonderful propaganda exercise !
It &apos;s a shame that the photo@@ grap@@ her of Re@@ u@@ ters di@@ dn &apos;t take into account the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to go to the M@@ oun@@ le M@@ ast@@ le and who prefer to give up the loyal Jews in a counter@@ er , taking the Wall out .
@ M@@ at , if this pho@@ to bo@@ thers you , it &apos;s right , it &apos;s neither the newspaper nor the photo@@ grap@@ her , but this woman and the ideology she trans@@ forms that you must condemn .
This system is not sustainable and will end up in a mess .
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution .
Since the economy seems to have gone in the stra@@ w , big companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They managed to convince their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they can &apos;t afford to increase salaries , while at the same time and without hiding , they have given ever higher salaries to the small elite at the top .
You are right , it &apos;s not sustainable , but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of going back and sle@@ eping when someone else makes the strike , support them , show a bit of solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems , but also shows your employer that we won &apos;t take people with impunity .
Ex@@ cep@@ t if we abandon democracy , in which case if it is tense .
I totally agree .
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
Like , for example , China and India .
All this can &apos;t end well .
It &apos;s because we are in a democracy that it held .
Have you voted for the P@@ T@@ C@@ I ?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ C@@ I ) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but that &apos;s exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and states is used for ( IS@@ D@@ S ) proposed by the agreement .
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the un@@ imagin@@ able damage that this agreement will have on our lives .
It &apos;s only recently that we &apos;@@ re starting to talk about it in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ an World Development Movement Look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back .
Did Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill not say &quot; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &quot; ?
These are excellent effects , while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
This gentle@@ man is right , in X@@ V@@ II there were unions in all the de@@ vil
In the very Catholic army of France , there is a dimension that is sacrific@@ ing it .
Le@@ a@@ ve it ( finally , its officers , the others , no one knows anything ) believe themselves to be the strong co@@ ff@@ er of the e@@ ternal values of France , and she will fight and will close her .
And then with the decline of the country , globalization , Europe , the value crisis , in short : the dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this little re@@ lic , it &apos;s comfor@@ ting .
Even if for her , it &apos;s more and more un@@ comfortable ...
They still lack the s@@ lack of married men , c@@ ali@@ br@@ ates , married women , c@@ ali@@ br@@ ates , lost dogs and I don &apos;t know what yet .
If you do not write the French correctly , I union .
You are warned , it will be your fault .
In order to defend the categor@@ ical interests we already suffer enough the protected professions with unions , which has created a equality of equality with other citizens .
We are asked not to lau@@ gh about the fear of the risk of an official .
We can very well imagine a system providing a certain freedom of expression without unions , or without the right to strike as in Germany , in return for the protection they enjoy .
If not , there &apos;s a disaster .
And with the char@@ ters that are preparing , the government welcomes it .
What security are you talking about ?
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance indeed ...
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance for ignorance . I was referring to the soldiers and other civil servants , since this is the subject here .
Sup@@ pose &quot; through its delegates &quot; in Article 8 of the preamble to the constitution of 19@@ 46 .
It will become : &quot; 8 .
Every worker is involved in the collective determination of working conditions as well as company management . &quot;
This is absolutely essential with the arrival of informa@@ tive power .
And yet you have opened , probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled &quot; The Great British B@@ ake review &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ?
Wa@@ it , the section was there , completely empty .
I thought we had to launch the convers@@ ation .
In any case it &apos;s the marriage of J@@ off@@ rey that I watched , and I can tell you that some have been well organised .
In the J@@ off@@ rey marriage episo@@ de we have one of the best moments ( although misleading : it was wine ) in the history of television .
Also , from the late m@@ m@@ m@@ h ...
G@@ ame of Th@@ ron@@ es !
I love G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
This is the second time in a row that , stran@@ gely , the show ends with a victory of the b@@ aker .
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally had an effect for them ?
The previous weeks , all these external people were side@@ lined .
And there is also this idea of &quot; playing security , there &apos;s always next week &quot; which dis@@ appears the last week .
I like co@@ o@@ king but I don &apos;t imagine myself doing that .
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us a great enter@@ tainment and push us to try new things .
Before for G@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree , the last challenge last year , the marriage ca@@ ke , was absurd .
The professionals usually make days to do them and they had to co@@ ok one in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three challenges were really difficult to share , I don &apos;t know how they could choose a vic@@ tor .
In Lu@@ is , the only real default they could find was the basis of a little dry ( even if I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood to say that the green ic@@ ing on the m@@ ill of Richard did not give en@@ vy , in any case Richard had already lost at the time ) .
I have to admit that several challenges of this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time available .
There is also cancer that gu@@ ys , with solar wind b@@ lows .
Obviously , everything is successful right now .
A bad time to pass for humanity , we hope .
You &apos;@@ re confusing sun with ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radiation .
The U@@ V@@ s are blocked mainly by the layer of ozone that is formed precisely by the impact of the sun@@ sh@@ ine wind par@@ ticles and the U@@ V@@ s .
So , even if the mag@@ netic field was weakening , there would not be enough solar wind to &quot; hun@@ ter &quot; the o@@ z@@ o@@ sphere o@@ z@@ o@@ sphere .
There would even be more , and so less U@@ V and &quot; canc@@ ers . &quot;
Fortunately , the layer of ozone does not block the U@@ V@@ s .
They have a lot of useful functions that you don &apos;t suspect .
If we limit ourselves to man , they have the interest to allow us to have os ( syn@@ syn@@ syn@@ syn@@ syn@@ syn@@ thesis D ) , to heat ourselves ( less than the in@@ fr@@ ou@@ ges ) , to mod@@ ul@@ ate our immune system and , it seems , to improve our mor@@ als .
The layer of ozone blocks carcino@@ gen@@ s and let them pass the U@@ V@@ A and most of the U@@ V@@ B .
Do you know that you are not obliged to be con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding and to consider your interlocu@@ tor to be a stay when you ask a comment ?
Especially for a minor clarification that was under-@@ heard in the comment , which itself intends to show ped@@ ago@@ gy .
Not to say that I &apos;@@ m a regular of the mix@@ ture , the U@@ V@@ s only do AC@@ C@@ L@@ ER its development .
They don &apos;t have P@@ RO@@ V@@ O@@ Q@@ U@@ N@@ T .
The proof is that all the b@@ ron@@ ky people do not necessarily have mix@@ an@@ om@@ es .
Either , when a tu@@ b tells you you have to avoid sun and live in the background of a ca@@ ve , it &apos;s better not to listen because the U@@ V@@ s are necessary for all human beings .
The excess , however , is like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
The U@@ V@@ s directly lead to mix@@ ture .
Can we apply it ?
And , more importantly , can we go to the mix ?
or go to the mix ...
I think that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be fulfilled if you apply sufficient force and the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 is perfectly acceptable , for the use it is destined .
I think that the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the i@@ Ph@@ hon@@ 6 as communication equipment in the first line .
But for us , others ,
It remains a good choice .
The majority of those who are interested have established that everything can be b@@ owed if you apply enough force there .
Ex@@ cep@@ t a No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
More specifically , is it already in force ?
This jo@@ ke is made in every discussion .
I decided to count them .
It &apos;s the fourth jo@@ ke about the pl@@ age I read in the comments today .
It &apos;s hard to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before we inst@@ all specific software , we imagine the phone was removed from the main production chain and we can &apos;t see how it could come back .
So , H@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ .@@ .
The most likely is that it &apos;s a unit of production on which the i@@ O@@ S has not been inst@@ alled correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code inst@@ alled .
I don &apos;t know how they do these things .
But would they put test software on all ?
The photo@@ graph@@ s on E@@ b@@ ay clearly show the absence of lo@@ go F@@ C@@ C or CE lo@@ go and the presence of a proto@@ type red link .
ah the article for b@@ ob@@ o par excellence .
We want products that are cheap and we &apos;@@ re surprised that the industri@@ alists produce an industri@@ alized &quot; industrial &quot; .
But to answer your post , if it is possible to eat correctly with a little salary .
After all , everyone is free to put his priorities where he sees fit .
For my part , food is one .
C@@ ome on , I k@@ iss you
We call b@@ ob@@ os , or better b@@ ob@@ o@@ Eco@@ lo@@ s , people who see the world through an ideological &quot; software &quot; that leads them to dis@@ connect reality .
It &apos;s the total de@@ t@@ t@@ ch thinking reason .
They are experts in the management , for example pur@@ sing to save the planet because they avoided taking a show@@ er .
They are also experts in tar@@ tu@@ f@@ ren@@ ie , joining in this the lef@@ ti@@ sts , which they sometimes come from , for example by condemning CO2 dis@@ charges while passing their holidays to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mix of red and ar@@ tu@@ f@@ ren@@ e ideology as well , don &apos;t be surprised to meet often with criticism about them .
W@@ ow , thank you for this complete and exhaustive the@@ ori@@ zation as well as for all the associated details ( plane , show@@ er ... ) .
I would like to be part of it but I don &apos;t find myself there .
The concept is not so complicated .
The b@@ ob@@ ob@@ lo@@ s are mon@@ ob@@ lo@@ c .
You understood the concept of lef@@ ti@@ sts ?
And well , you can understand the concept of b@@ ob@@ o@@ ecological .
It &apos;s a perfect copy with just an ideological nu@@ ance .
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the eco@@ lo@@ ads .
The b@@ ob@@ o@@ Eco@@ l@@ o is one of them but only represents the most visible part of the Eco@@ lo@@ s because it is the one that inf@@ ers the media .
This is a nice gi@@ fe .
Ap@@ parently , no one wants to watch this gi@@ fe in the face .
She is so badly made that she looks v@@ agu@@ ely to a female n@@ u .
You are next to the pl@@ ate .
We must be part of the micro@@ co@@ s@@ m of art to understand the ama@@ zing beau@@ ty of the truth of this work .
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not spent in@@ num@@ erable decades studying and pan@@ dering of great artists .
The important thing is not that E@@ m@@ in doesn &apos;t know how to design and still seems obs@@ essed with the same subject .
The important thing is that she has really managed to become a great rich and famous person with no artistic capacity .
It &apos;s from * art * .
No , it &apos;s co@@ o@@ king .
The fact that E@@ m@@ in doesn &apos;t know
This is not really a proven fact .
It &apos;s rather an opinion .
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs that smoke by playing the b@@ ill@@ ard .
Jud@@ ging art may be problematic , but not in that case .
De@@ termin@@ ing , it &apos;s much more than just representing real ones .
If you &apos;@@ re looking for it , a pho@@ to de@@ vice will do the business .
The author also speaks of E@@ m@@ in &apos;s ex@@ es@@ per@@ ation .
Look again and let the image speak for itself , without compar@@ ing it to the kind of design you maybe prefer .
If it &apos;s so easy , why do you not do it yourself ?
There is still a lot to do savings : equi@@ ties activities , the number of hor@@ ses of the republic@@ an custody or the status of the generals who are no longer in active service ..@@ .@@ .
Un@@ honesty means that France is decreasing its workforce , but as all the countries have done , sometimes even more drastically , starting with Great Britain .
It &apos;s only half encouraging ...
The operation without the support , it quickly finds its limits !
A sing@@ ular approach , when we see the weaknesses , the deficiencies of our defence tool , especially in the Sa@@ hel .
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned , who lose a dimension of their activities , or even a part of their history .
Where is the promised sanc@@ tu@@ ary ?
@ ed@@ mon@@ d : that &apos;s what I was saying , look elsewhere where making savings but especially not at home , my home is really not possible ...
That &apos;s exactly what you propose to do , look elsewhere where the ab@@ using is certain .
That all those who have lived near or pro@@ pped up the military thing dare to say here , the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this per@@ me@@ ter and this without la@@ ugh@@ ing .
That we apply the same po@@ tion to the public service as a whole and public finances will go a little better .
And for Jo@@ i : really rela@@ xed : look at the inflation of public jobs in the other departments and you will understand why the Defense could be a bit responsible !
Well yes , the savings on which everyone agrees that they have to be made , you need to be seen somewhere , no ?
Man@@ que of po@@ t , those on whom it falls victim to the murder when it happens to them , the poor .
We should do it but especially that it doesn &apos;t fall above me because in this case , it &apos;s a crime and not an economy .
Gu@@ i@@ ls , go !
How to close the V@@ ale de Gra@@ ce will weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As for the local authorities , history repe@@ ats itself at every closing post , maternity , hospital , bar@@ r@@ acks .
But everyone is for savings of course .
It &apos;s we@@ ir@@ d , a may@@ or U@@ M@@ P who wants compensation and does not welcome savings made in public spending .
This article is really the most ama@@ zing thing I &apos;@@ ve ever read !
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad jo@@ ke .
It &apos;s the de@@ pressed to get his Fac@@ e@@ book thre@@ ad out and to see that 80 % of his friends started their stat@@ utes with the phrase &quot; this embarrassing moment &quot; .
I think they will make a mo@@ vi@@ e .
He will surely be bas@@ ing himself on hil@@ arious scenes where someone comes by chance on his ex in the bus by going to work and realized only where his judge went back into his tr@@ ick .
It &apos;s not embarrassing , it &apos;s completely stupid .
Not really , in my opinion the author takes the role of British man typical of whom we have always learned to bur@@ n his emotions and bur@@ n te@@ eth .
I am sure that if you are a f@@ an of K@@ ate Bush , the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong .
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights ?
I don &apos;t have &quot; the internet &quot; .
I don &apos;t think I can comment .
Not having a computer .
My God , I need to make this mo@@ vi@@ e before I die !
I can &apos;t believe how un@@ believ@@ able this article is that I never read !
Char@@ lie has just shown that it is above the top of the co@@ sm@@ ic uni@@ verse that is sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I &apos;@@ m coming to the ver@@ ge !
It &apos;s absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter so that they finally have the illusion and dis@@ credit the incredible ul@@ g@@ ur@@ ance and the insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us that j@@ ail@@ ed in the ke@@ y@@ board of Mr. Bro@@ o@@ ker as a div@@ ine f@@ uck .
Well God , it was really bad .
Especially if it &apos;s not women , nor is it the case .
I &apos;@@ m a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive evolution within democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective associate initiatives .
Up until now , we are taking away the right to save our planet from states that play the tar@@ tu@@ ff@@ es at every meeting to save the planet .
So we decide , citizens , to take things in hand .
With the Commissioner they worked for energy , all these nice recommendations went away ..@@ .@@ .
Tr@@ é@@ gu@@ ez : E@@ oli@@ è@@ ne and solar farms are tomorrow &apos;s R@@ ain@@ s .
All financed by the i@@ dio@@ tic .
Please stop this pro-@@ nuclear dis@@ course .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
radio@@ activity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety , it is better to limit it to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is our only sal@@ vation , provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able electricity to fight against CO2 emissions ?
France is in no way concerned .
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emission in production and ep@@ sil@@ on for other steps .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity by wind renewable or P@@ V it &apos;s already more G@@ ES on other steps and especially gas , or worse coal as in Germany , to compensate for inter@@ mit@@ tent .
Re@@ placing nuclear power with wind renewable or P@@ V would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Chris@@ tine , I &apos;@@ m not insul@@ ting you . I &apos;@@ m a physical sciences in physical sciences . 198@@ 1 , I did research into nuclear physi@@ cs . I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said .
For what I di@@ dn &apos;t say it &apos;s you who give me ideas I di@@ dn &apos;t say anything about Germany . Nothing in fact you di@@ dn &apos;t respond to what I was saying and like all the right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ish the interlocu@@ tor I never do it .
I also cite the conclusion of experts man@@ dated by the German government : the current programme of the R@@ ene@@ w@@ able Energy Germany is a non-@@ profitable and inefficient way to reduce G@@ ES emissions and should be stopped .
0 show if you don &apos;t count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you don &apos;t count the greenhouse gas v@@ ap@@ our of less effect than Co@@ 2 , it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is part of water v@@ ap@@ our and a bit in the water river .
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a &quot; South Asian giant &quot; ... !
Last time , Pakistan won against H@@ un@@ ano .
It doesn &apos;t surprise me , most Indi@@ ans who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan .
Ac@@ tually , it shows your state of mind .
It would have been the same if they had qualified the giant India of South Asia ...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate , but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply be open to a P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box full of corruption and ma@@ fia .
As for the I@@ SL , today &apos;s opening match was surprisingly interesting , the A@@ le@@ ti@@ co of Kou@@ k@@ ata is imposing 3-@@ 0 against M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
compared to the billions and billions that India spends on cr@@ ic@@ ket from the I@@ PL and now to so@@ cc@@ er , how could we one day rival our &quot; no@@ is@@ y neighbors &quot; ...
The S@@ low Co@@ st race will pay for it .
B@@ age for such a nice project .
For the incident , the possible lack of design manife@@ sts itself only with a cold hel@@ l@@ um .
So we may not be in a lack of design , but in implementing it ...
unlike ari@@ an@@ space that is a private company , it seems that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insu@@ rer .@@ .
Maybe they &apos;@@ re going to pay the satell@@ ites on a fri@@ g@@ ate that knows .@@ .
This is all the more anno@@ ying because many media take the only articles of articles in their b@@ reath - and many read@@ ers only keep these ti@@ t@@ les .
All of this creates a false impression that runs counter to the content of the article itself .
In full agreement with you , the title is not appropriate , it un@@ ju@@ stly calls into question the project when it &apos;s only a problem of lan@@ e .
