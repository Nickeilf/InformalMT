I had only one experience of working , in a saving , I had to receive and orders for staff , almost all of the time I was under pressure , and I had no right to stop ( even after working 6-@@ 7 hours in aff@@ ili@@ ation ) before we finished all of them . There is a need for and deli@@ veries to be made .
At the beginning it was co@@ ol but hard , I was happy to do something else for once , if I were to earn the money , and it was a sport , so it was all b@@ right .
When one day one of my colleagues with whom I worked and who I would say ?
There has been a misunderstanding of the fact that foot and mouth disease is coming to an end in order to make the orders .
He and I have never heard of them , despite my many attempts ( to divide up the tasks ) .
At the end of the day , there were a number of orders , and it was also necessary to take stock of the fri@@ dge , and I would therefore like to say that I agree to make the inven@@ tory an inven@@ tory if it does the rest of the orders .
He is in agreement .
I finish the work and go home to me .
Then next Monday , I am called on to say that there is a big problem that the orders that should have been made have not been made .
They find that my colleague &apos; for@@ got &apos; to do his job , except that , instead of ad@@ mitting him , he rejected me , I at the beginning did not understand what it was , I was asked to do it in the topical and urgent debate , in 15 minutes that was settled .
Then I am told in a ro@@ yal calm that everything was my fault and I am made redundant .
I am not particularly trying to fight , the ho@@ tel was in judicial recovery , I had an air ticket scheduled in 1 months &apos; time to break me off the island for six months , so that was a bit of a bit of a bit of time and time was left for me to move .
However , I have always been in the thro@@ es of this betra@@ yal , and for a first working experience it really is no longer complete .

It is not because , once again , you are deliberately ignoring the whole historical background of this , that is , a few millen@@ nia of men / women &apos;s injustice and a still mach@@ o culture .
You can make a law , a rule , without context .
A box is the same one , you would forget about a few centuries of black slave labour .
This is not a biased way of thinking , in fact , it is dis@@ honest , because you are deliberately refusing to take into account the reality of today &apos;s society and its historical foundations , because they favour your reasoning .
And you are ignoring all the historical background of segreg@@ ation between men and women to advocate segreg@@ ation as the only solution to the problem we are talking about .
And do you not extra@@ pol@@ ate me ?
You completely use the other solutions , pre@@ tending to be sorry to es@@ p@@ ous@@ ing this one , because the situation makes it necessary .
But on the subject of an application that knows the identity of all the speakers , who can know their position , who notes , who receives the comments of the clients , etc .
Do you really believe that there really is no solution than segreg@@ ation ?
And when I propose the port of weapon , you claim to oppose it for ideological reasons , as I am against segreg@@ ation for ideological reasons , but because it is forbidden .
However , sexual discrimination is also banned !
C@@ ome on , let us be mad , let us propose .
Because , for that to be co@@ ver@@ t on this square , the solution is that the same thing is being proposed to men to the effect that the same thing will be done to the men and to the men , which will be of no use at all , but will solve the problem .
This is a good example of how you do not read my own .
I do not want a single one .
I do not want discrimination .
As N@@ elson Man@@ de@@ la did not want bl@@ acks against wh@@ ites , he wanted an end to racism .
You think that you are so small that you do not realise that people can be defended .
It is not for fear of off@@ ending the men I am against , it is for fear of off@@ ending the world .
St@@ reng@@ th@@ ening discrimination between men and women in the two sen@@ ses , prejudices , c@@ lic@@ h@@ és , cultural differences that explain differences in access to power .
So , if it is , a &apos; U@@ ber femin@@ in &apos; , as it stands , it may be a fo@@ reg@@ round ( as it says : unfortunately , because it is not , basically , I am not too much for this kind of thing , I was just saying that the simple fact that this measure is being taken shows that it is the case that The basic problem is real .

It is therefore necessary .

The fact that this is the case is admissible as evidence .
The judge can already order preventive arrests if evidence of the p@@ lot of broadband violence is provided , such as an appeal on Fac@@ e@@ book , thanks to the whole arsen@@ al of the state of emergency that has been incorporated into the law .
So how do we need this new , extremely liber@@ tici@@ de , authoritarian and dictatorial law to stop the thu@@ gs ?
When such a law makes it possible to prevent the freedom to demonstrate a judge without order , when procedural remedies can only be exercised with the assistance of a lawyer after the event , so that a judge ass@@ esses the accuracy of the measure , that the so-called use can last for years with presum@@ ption of guilt in the meantime , When such a law impe@@ des individual freedoms , which can support it ?

Where , then , the phrase &apos; Europe has ever had a ma@@ m@@ mo@@ th programme &apos;
Unfortunately , there was no choice ( it was a sense of feeling , of em@@ ail@@ s ) , but I agree that it would have made even more fine lines .
Having said that , I would like to say whether you have found an effective political entity which is in less than two months &apos; time .
You are turning the issue into a reality .
I did not ask for a political movement .
Just that they learn to demonstrate in law , without trigg@@ ering a s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot , that they are learning to clean up their r@@ ank &apos;s r@@ ank that is mud@@ dling their message .
If you really want to talk about political movement , even if it is a bad thing for me to have the pu@@ b , it has to be said that they have gone quickly .
All the more so as politicians have a cause , and that is what I am explaining , it is a movement that has been created in the de@@ fi@@ ance of representation .
We are re@@ ap@@ ing the will of our political classes to limit democracy to the vote .
This is in no way the result of the desire of the current policies .
This goes back much further , and it is difficult to circum@@ vent a country of the size of France .
Above all , the maintenance of the traditional functioning of the Fifth Republic was favoured by the majority of French people who had the opportunity to vote for a candidate who proposed an opening to a 6@@ th re@@ public with less representation , to assemb@@ lies of professionals ... ( not perfect , but the least worst of the candidates in my view ) .
So no if you are still in the same system ( of mer@@ ch@@ ant , you agree ) that is because of the choice of people .
It is chil@@ dish to put the blame on the policies .
Where , then , we need to explain why rather than accuse it .
The forces of law and order must respect a gradu@@ ated response and not lead the way .
There is agreement on this , and there are some bad elements in the police who may have done so .
But I sincerely believe that , in such confusion , you can return to the high part of someone &apos;s body without having been targeted at this place .
It is true that there will be a la@@ is@@ se@@ z-@@ pass@@ er for the police and that this is not normal .
The work of the police is also to protect the population and also to protect the population .
Can it really protect the G@@ J@@ D from the thu@@ gs if the demonstrations are not declared ?
What are they giving him the means to do the work that they are asking him to do ?
Is it not the case that there is a certain degree of agreement on the part of the G@@ J with regard to the thu@@ gs and a desire to do so with the forces of law and order ?
They have destroyed the social dialogue .
D@@ is is to know what I am voting for , because he does not agree with me .
It is obvious that it cannot even be argued about an an@@ onymous forum without being si@@ len@@ ced by the first type that bears the br@@ unt of the movement , ... is it not the policies that destroy the social dialogue .
It is horri@@ fied by the lack of organisation and violence that it generates .

It is the tax of ordinary French people who will pay for rep@@ airs .

Firstly , I am not very off@@ ended .
I simply think it is a lack of sensitivity towards the victims and , above all , their families .
My indignation is more on the author of the images who wanted to make money with , I imagine .
I can only specul@@ ate about its real motives .
To try to think of having tra@@ gically lost one or the other loved ones and seeing them in a fic@@ tion of fic@@ tion .
Not a reconstruction of so-called events to the news , not a docu@@ mentary , not a film on the subject , but a completely de@@ t@@ ached s@@ cri@@ pt .
People who give psychological and moral support to the survi@@ v@@ ors always advise to avoid new bal@@ lots for several weeks .
There are too many events that are too big to avoid , such as 11 September , which was mentioned earlier .
The families of the victims of 9 / 11 did not watch F@@ light 93 , neither the French docu@@ mentary on the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , nor the film with Ni@@ k C@@ age , etc .
But if we used the images of the tow@@ ers that are cr@@ umbling in a film about the apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se , they would be right to feel fl@@ ou@@ ted or insul@@ ted .
In the case of Bir@@ d Bo@@ x , this is a sequ@@ ence of what , just 2 seconds , and again ?
But it is a trigger for someone who lost his family in an accident and who is trying to dis@@ tr@@ action with a good sense of horror , so that , in the middle of the film , he re@@ vis@@ es the explosion of his wife or friends or friends ...
The problem is that the fic@@ ti@@ tious la@@ z@@ iness makes gest@@ ures in@@ sensitive to their producers .
It is not clear to make an explosion of this intensity and it costs an arm .
Why not take a real ?
Now , perhaps , &apos; because people have died &apos; could weigh a little more in the balance .
No , clearly not .
To say that this is mainly popular among far-@@ right nationalist parties .

At the same time , being in Barcelona does not mean warm@@ th all the year .

I should like to make a point of order .
I am interested in ideas not to the people .
I find it legitimate to have a fear of immigration from people from other continents with other cultures and how to perceive the world .
It is even natural to see it as wil@@ der@@ ness , it is a very humane reaction to preservation .
What is not as you are or is not familiar with a fear , a cu@@ ri@@ osity will see a rejection .
Especially when it can see some of the problems associated with immigration ( the examples it gives ) .
I find it legitimate for a population to have concerns about immigration .
And I think it is less legitimate to make a mo@@ ck@@ ery of it .

And he is interested in a subject which is close to his heart .

After we@@ ary debates it is something else , and everyone can interpret things differently .
It repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats and repe@@ ats for the sole purpose of tr@@ um@@ ping a message .
A@@ h , let us have another xenophobic op@@ ponent !
Un@@ believ@@ able , you are multi@@ plying !
There is a need for fear of the big replacement ? &apos;
It is like the pu@@ b .
When you say , repeat , that in such a shop it is cheaper , that there is such a reduction , and so on ; it is not arguments .
The aim of the message is not to be an argument .
The aim is to exist and to occupy space .
That is something we can agree on .
There is no basis for this .
There is nothing more than the expression of a profound hatred of those who have identified as foreigners .
I think there is a substance .
He believes that immigration is not something of a be@@ ati@@ tu@@ m , according to him .
He is therefore trying to draw attention to what he thinks is important and the negative side .
Not that there is a problem with people in particular ( such as a more French immigrant than the French ) , but with the principle of multicul@@ tur@@ alism , demo@@ graphy , and religion .
In fact , I am aware of this , but I am talking to me about it .
I put a quot@@ ation on the forum to support my first point ( thank@@ fully that I remember the name of the author ) .
The oldest attitude , which is probably based on sound psychological foundations , since it tends to re@@ appear in each of us when we are placed in an unexpected situation , consists purely and simply of repu@@ di@@ ating the cultural , religious , social and a@@ es@@ thetic forms that are the most remote . Of those we identify with .
‘ Wil@@ d life ’ , ‘ this is not our home ’ , ‘ we should not allow this to happen ’ , ‘ it should not be allowed ’ , etc . , so many crude reactions that reflect the same bro@@ ther , the same re@@ pul@@ sion in the presence of ways of living , of believing or of thinking that we are ali@@ en .
Thus , in ancient times , she was bas@@ ing everything that was not part of the Greek ( and then G@@ reco@@ -@@ Roman ) culture under the same name as bar@@ b@@ arians ; Western civili@@ zation then used the term wild in the same direction .
Beh@@ ind these ep@@ i@@ the@@ ts is the same judgement : it is likely that the barbar@@ ous word refers to the confusion and in@@ articul@@ ation of the birds ’ s@@ ong , which is opposed to the meaning of the human language ; and wild , which means ‘ forest ’ , as well as a sort of ‘ forest ’ . Animal life as opposed to human culture .
&#91; ... &#93; this attitude of thought , on behalf of which we reject the ‘ wild ’ ( or all those who are chosen to regard it as such ) out of humanity , is precisely the most significant and inst@@ inc@@ tive attitude of these very sav@@ ages .
&#91; ... &#93; <unk> g@@ t@@ te stop at the borders of the tri@@ be , from the language group , sometimes even from the village ; so much so that a large number of so-called pri@@ mi@@ tive populations are themselves nam@@ ing a name that means &apos; men &apos; ( or sometimes - shall we say with more discretion ? – the ‘ Good , the “ excellent ” , the “ full ” – involving other tri@@ bes , groups , or villages do not participate in virtu@@ es or even human nature , but are at most comp@@ ound of “ bad ” , “ bad ” , “ mon@@ ke@@ ys , ” or “ from the bottom up . ” po@@ u eggs . ”
We often go so far as to deprive the foreign of the latter of reality by making it a ‘ gh@@ o@@ st ’ or ‘ appearance ’ .
As a result , there are curious situations in which two interlocu@@ tors find themselves in a hur@@ ry .
In the Great Anti@@ l@@ les , a few years after the discovery of America , while the Span@@ i@@ ards sent committees of inquiry to find out whether the indigenous people had a soul or not , they were trying to im@@ mer@@ se prisoners of conscience , in order to check , by means of prolonged surveillance , if their cor@@ p@@ ses were to be found . It was or not subject to the pu@@ tre@@ fac@@ tion .
&#91; ... &#93; ... by refusing humanity to those who appear to be the most “ wild ” or “ bar@@ b@@ arians ” of its representatives , only to borrow one from their typical attitudes .
The barbaric is first and foremost the man who believes in barbar@@ ism .
When studying such facts – and other areas of civili@@ zation , such as social institutions , art , religion , and religion , as well as other areas of civili@@ zation – one won@@ ders whether human societies do not define themselves , with regard to their mutual relations , by a certain optimis@@ t . Di@@ versity beyond which they cannot go , but below which they cannot , either , come out of danger &apos; .
It is a case of greater diversity , and it is the relationship with the other cultures that are compromised .
L@@ ess diversity , and every culture in itself is at risk .
&#91; ... &#93; too many differences , and the gap becomes insur@@ moun@@ table ; not enough gap , and identity is dying .
. I am opposed to the abuse of language by which , increasingly , we are confusing racism and normal , legitimate attitudes , which are , in any case , inevitable .
Racism is a doctrine that claims to see in the intellectual and moral character attributed to a set of individuals the necessary effect of a common genetic heritage .
One cannot accept under the same heading , or automatically as@@ cri@@ be to the same prejudice the attitude of individuals or groups that their loyalty to certain values is partly or totally in@@ sensitive to other values .
He is in no way guilty of putting a way of living and of thinking above all others , and of having little attr@@ action to such or such , whose kind of life , respec@@ table in itself , is moving too far away from the one that has traditionally been attached .
This relative in@@ securities may even be the price to be paid if the value systems of each spiritual family or community are to be preserved , and they can find the resources for their renewal in their own resources .
If , as I have written elsewhere , there is a certain diversity of diversity between human societies beyond which they cannot go , but below which they cannot go without danger either , it must be acknowledged that this diversity is largely the result of each culture ’ s desire to oppose those that are surrounding the environment . To distinguish itself from them , in a word to be self-@@ sufficient : they do not know , they go down on the occasion , but in order not to per@@ ish , it is essential that , in other reports , there is a degree of imper@@ me@@ ability between them .

There is a lot of context , but let us try !
1 - Yes .
In the case of 3 , the context is still crucial .
4 : A debate / evidence from a judicial point of view , in my view of the influence of X on Y@@ . But , if it is not a murde@@ rer , it is col@@ lu@@ ding with murder / inci@@ dental to m@@ ur@@ der / y@@ ou@@ re , down by mu@@ th@@ a@@ fu@@ k@@ a , in my view .
5 : &apos; There is no 5 b@@ ide@@ l &apos; , and I am disappointed that this is the case .
6 : I can imagine that , by studying the level of awareness of risks ( such as it was in@@ con@@ gr@@ uous or otherwise , or that it has been said to be &apos; it is going to rise by dozens and I am t@@ ying it out &apos; , the murder can be regarded .
7 - 9 : no , but it is a level 2 .
10 : no , it is soft , but the ca@@ us@@ e-@@ and-@@ effect relationship is too difficult to establish .
11 : it is far too uncertain .
It is absolutely impossible to guarantee that an action will not lead to the death of anyone , just as the opposite is the case .
So you always come to scenarios or you can argue that , despite the potential potential death of some , other actions that are more pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy on paper would ultimately present the same risk .
My answer specifically focused on the C@@ un@@ u Re@@ quest Research , not all aid to the private sector .
Having said that , I am a little disappointed with the votes received on my comment ( I do not specifically target my comment ) , while I was only giving an opinion in a respectful manner .
If you make your product from X + 3 to X 2@@ 36 , then the product is already expensive and the price increase to compensate for the tax will not be felt by consumers , or it will be too important for consumers to be able to continue to offer it and return to an alternative .
If you want to lower the demand to increase &apos; only &apos; by 1.@@ 5 ° C , is it not better not to ensure that practices that jeopardise this objective are no longer possible ?
Do you want to continue to make a profit until such time as this is no longer possible ?

I would like to und@@ o a p@@ ile of stereotypes in this comment .
I am pol@@ ite , so I did not la@@ ment anyone over the last few days when the world ( more specifically the media ) broke the “ storm of the century . ”
That is all !
Firstly , I have already seen worse times in the year I spent in Bas@@ -@@ San L@@ au@@ rent .
From a person &apos;s point of view , I could easily have la@@ ugh@@ ed out of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ( which could also have la@@ ugh@@ ed at the Mon@@ tre@@ al@@ ese , because I spent a winter in Mon@@ tre@@ al as well , and that was nothing to do with the winter in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ) .
Secondly , as Al@@ ber@@ t@@ in , I could have la@@ ugh@@ ed out of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c who ann@@ ul@@ led all the plans , sports matches and so on because of the &apos; so dangerous &apos; conditions .
I did not la@@ ment , because I understand that it is prudent not to take risks when you are not used to it .
But this storm was like every other storm in me@@ ad@@ ows every year .
I , and I , have been living in the same way as I did in the same city , on the motor@@ way , on the mountains in the mountains ( the worst ) almost always without winter ty@@ res and always in a small t@@ ank ( tr@@ action before ) and without incident .
It is quite easy , it is not like a c@@ on and is aware of the condition of the road by testing the bra@@ kes often and when no one is close .
Thirdly , I have hal@@ ted E@@ d@@ mon@@ ton several years .
That is your comment .
I confess that the city of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c is better than Ed@@ mon@@ ton ( Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c is so similar to 3@@ x the s@@ now ) , but Ed@@ mon@@ ton is a good one by d@@ wind@@ ling .
The world fails only because small residential streets ( whose city has caused too much of it ) are not treated in the first place .
But the city is rapidly rele@@ asing the roads for buses and other main roads .
They manage the s@@ now efficiently in E@@ d@@ mon@@ ton .
Finally , your comment of the British people of Colombia was full of mistakes .
You have par@@ ted the L@@ ow@@ er Main@@ land ( a me@@ tr@@ o V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver ) and for@@ got that the other million km of kilome@@ tre will be s@@ now , especially in the mountains .
The non-@@ Colom@@ bi@@ ans who are outside V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver are quite accustomed to doing so .
It is better than many in the city .
In addition , how many of the West ’ s “ Chinese ” “ Chinese ? ”
I know the situation in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver too much , but Al@@ ber@@ ta has people of Chinese origin , including second-@@ generation , which are as competent as the others because they were born in Al@@ ber@@ ta .
Life is not impossible , if that is what you want to hear .
But not to be in opposition is all .
It is an impression that the government in France is setting itself up as a benefit or your access to a good in particular ( such as g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine ) on an identity card that would contain a whole raft of in@@ fo@@ es on you as your political orientation , your income , your religion , etc .
Even if it does not affect the amount of all@@ ergy , the government ’ s explo@@ itative government would do so .
What would you think about it if Mac@@ ron announced that tomorrow ?
The mainstream newspapers are ske@@ w@@ ed against Mad@@ uro , which is normal , and that is what the majority in the West expects of them .
On the other hand , you will have to make me the dec@@ eptive articles in the Mon@@ de because it is not very complicated to s@@ lander Mad@@ uro either , his policy is open to criticism , and it often comes to him to tell fine acquain@@ tan@@ ces .
Mad@@ uro is not Cha@@ vez .
He will never get back to the UN to critici@@ ze P@@ T@@ T@@ US with a Ch@@ om@@ sky b@@ ust in his hands .
Then the situation in Venezuela goes a little further than &apos; oil equals US interference &apos; .
This is not entirely wrong , but it is simplistic and it will convince a great world .

One / the &apos; Communism &apos; was applied only in poor countries , whose regimes were unstable , viol@@ ently , that is to say , in contexts where all kinds of regimes were broken .
The minimum to judge Communism ( if the countries that claimed it were , but I do not have the impression that democracy and the collective ownership by the workers were the model that was applied ) would at least be seen as a favourable minimum .
On the contrary , the extreme right has seen what it is doing in all the contexts imagin@@ able , and every time it is horror .
Having said that ...

But it seemed to me to be deserved since you were repeating only two times F@@ N and not extreme L@@ ES .
I do not see the point of talking about the extreme left in France that it accounts for less than 1 % of the electorate , and that the representation of his ideas , as well as being at the lowest level , is in sharp decline in the world .
I can only wonder what businesses would do if the Naz@@ is were to come to power nowadays .
They would do as they are systematically done collectively : they would work together by their overwhelming majority .

<unk> g@@ to@@ g@@ t@@ ; In@@ f@@ lation : every year , money loses its value .
The risk is that if you propose a 5 % return rate to invest in T@@ es@@ la , you will say no .
It is a connec@@ ting one .
There is a high risk of high R@@ R@@ R .
That is what the market is offering : you could put it on the stock market or in the bank .
In order to return to our oil projects , <unk> g@@ to@@ g@@ t@@ te .
You have given some thought .
You can see that it is in a position to do so .
You believe that the acceptable R@@ R@@ R in view of inflation and risk is 7 % .
<unk> g@@ t@@ . T@@ u make - 100 + ( 0 / 1.@@ 0@@ 7 ) + ( 0 / 1.@@ 0@@ 72 ) + ( 120 / 1.@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 73 ) = 2.@@ 0@@ 4
<unk> g@@ t@@ . T@@ u make - 100 + ( 60 / 1.@@ 0@@ 7 ) + ( 50 / 1.@@ 0@@ 72 ) + ( 5 / 1.@@ 0@@ 73 ) = 3.@@ 08
<unk> g@@ to@@ g@@ t@@ . The first project is negative .
You are losing out .
<unk> g@@ to@@ g@@ t@@ . The second project is the most profitable .
In view of this , it was not .
Why is it more profitable ?
Because with the second project the f@@ ric@@ tion is being recovered from the first year and the second year .
He is more hi@@ j@@ acked earlier in your poc@@ ket .
What does that mean ?
That you can put it immediately on the stock market or in other projects .
And you will hit $ dollars even earlier .
In any case , it is the case that you are setting in motion the health , social and environmental consequences .
<unk> g@@ g@@ t@@ ; T@@ u is in t@@ at@@ ters in br@@ ush@@ ing up the number of people that it will kill or inj@@ ure .
We are moving in the right direction , but then completely .
<unk> g@@ to@@ g@@ t@@ . The only tr@@ ick is to do the N@@ P@@ V .
Indeed , the R@@ R@@ R rate is needed in order to calculate the N@@ P@@ V .
R@@ R@@ R like R@@ ate of In@@ f@@ lation , R@@ is@@ k , and Mar@@ k@@ et R@@ ate of R@@ et@@ re@@ n .
This rate therefore includes the risk of losing f@@ ric@@ tion .
The risk that you will be crow@@ ded , that you will discover that you are violating the law , that you are interfering , that the whole of the population is revol@@ ting .
The R@@ R@@ R includes everything .
TO@@ U@@ T .
If that is a good thing , we are doing it .
It is a problem , if it is destructive for the biodiversity of seeds , if the consumer is paid for the illegal activities of La@@ fe@@ u@@ x , or if climate change acceler@@ ates more of climate change .
It is for that reason that it makes me mark that &apos; companies destroy the environment by selling even more pl@@ as@@ tics &apos; .

These pages are addressed to the general public .
The only rule is not bankruptcy , not prison , D@@ O IT .
All decisions in finance are based on that .
All of them .
It is estimated that if we lose f@@ ric@@ tion , or if there is a risk of a H@@ ard judicial reaction ( not a minor fine ) , the destruction of the brand image ( = loss of f@@ ric@@ tion ) or a violent political attack ( = loss of f@@ ric@@ tion ) .
C@@ ash is King .
If the government wants investment to no longer be made , it must take tough measures .
In the case of violation of the law , extremely violent fines ( EUR 10 billion ) or state se@@ iz@@ ures .
This will push R@@ I@@ SK up considerably , one of the important elements in the calculation of the N@@ P@@ V@@ s .
As a result , investors will refuse to put their f@@ ric@@ tion off there .
The N@@ P@@ V is all that counts .

The second is the achievement of a majority of a market ( Micro@@ soft ) , the agreements between companies ( according to the Inte@@ l / Ap@@ ple / Pi@@ x@@ ar / Google agreements ) , the construction of a very strong brand ( Ap@@ ple ) , the creation of a consumer de@@ men@@ tia ( S@@ E@@ V@@ s ) . or positive products , or the weakening and division of suppliers ( the big bran@@ ds and the textile industry , or L@@ ac@@ it@@ s and the milk sel@@ lers ) .

On the famous letter for obtaining the passport .
There are , therefore , two versions .
B@@ in@@ al@@ la &apos;s she is incompatible with that of Stra@@ zo@@ da .
... or then , the hypo@@ thesis that I am submitting to you and which I have not heard from anyone ( and which may not be the way it may be : I have praised elements that have invali@@ dated it ? ) : is it possible for a third figure to co@@ exist with these two versions ?
Is it conceivable that an employee of the Presidency has applied for a passport on behalf of Ben@@ al@@ la , without noti@@ fying his service at the moment and without dis@@ covering that he was responsible following the re@@ vel@@ ations in the Can@@ ard En@@ t@@ é in recent days ?
Last week , she would have said his truth , as Ben@@ al@@ la would have said today .
This 3@@ r@@ d myster@@ y , a member of the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e E@@ ly@@ s@@ gra@@ m , can tell the truth but would prefer to remain silent in the hope of not being affected by the scandal .
If so , is Ben@@ al@@ la aware of this action from the beginning , but has it only been lea@@ ked to justice , last week when the question was first asked ?
Would that be the case , is it a possibility in your opinion ?

Per@@ mit me made an V@@ I@@ C , it is a good experience , in something other than S@@ S@@ II for me and a bit of travelling , and so on .

Apart from an un@@ quote mention of the English wi@@ ki of the series , which says that she holds a record Guin@@ ness , impossible to have anything to do with it .
What I found to be a little f@@ lan@@ king is the fact that you have to calculate an audience and a Mar@@ et sh@@ are , and that is perhaps not as easy and reliable as it sounds , so I imagine that it is difficult to do more than an interesting an@@ ec@@ do@@ te and not one There is no doubt about that .
However , I would like to say thank you .
It is not simply a question of making presentation , it is often asked to make the extraction of data with al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms .
This type of ta@@ g has been offered my po@@ t that is doc@@ toral in bi@@ -@@ inf@@ o ( he makes m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular sim@@ ulation with programmes that he and he and he still ) .
I am not saying that there is a doc@@ torate but at least an engine@@ er .
I am looking forward to looking into it .

I am not interested in this .
And what is the racist passage ?
The speed of over@@ sho@@ ot ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
It is a good thing .
I know that we are not on the issue of auth@@ a@@ tics , but the over@@ sho@@ oting route is reserved to go beyond the maximum speed of over@@ sho@@ ot .
If you exceed anyone else , it is not a matter of any kind .
Yes , speed must be mod@@ ul@@ ated according to the road conditions , but it is not just for the route of over@@ sho@@ ot .
An@@ ys@@ ay when you go beyond you , or almost faster than the limit .
It is up to the police and every driver to decide his or her safety speed not to a game or to my un@@ c@@ le blocking the left route to decide for the others .
They can put someone out for the reason they want , as long as it is not illegal .
9@@ 8.@@ 5 has just taken advantage of this situation in order to react to a g@@ ang of re@@ pres@@ sions .
It is an an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal event to say that a co@@ p refused entry to a hum@@ or@@ ist because he had d@@ ad@@ ers , and that is a perfect example of an@@ ec@@ do@@ te .
In the case of 9@@ 8.@@ 5 in the event , a whole tragedy is taking place .
By the way , it is a tig@@ er to the fate of the general population , but only the population of the population that it suits will accept it ?
Yes .
T@@ u is going to have a v@@ agu@@ ely representative assembly with this , and it is worth making a draw on the fate of the general public .
This , however , is without ir@@ ony .
If you forces me to go along , I will go along with the rules , but I will sab@@ otage the work as much as I can , even if it does harm to my fellow citizens .
( This will be a good thing , they will have put me in a position . )
Do you want this to be an arbitrary representa@@ tiveness ?
I say arbitr@@ arily , because in your Assembly you are not going to put children aged two or the mentally ill , if ?
O@@ u@@ ai d@@ g too much of the bu@@ g under S@@ af@@ i ( and that comment since S@@ af@@ i ) is perhaps the fault of the web develop@@ er and not the b@@ row@@ ser , but I regularly have sites that bu@@ g under S@@ af@@ i and when I go through the Cha@@ m@@ bers of a problem .
I am still using S@@ af@@ i as the main b@@ row@@ ser ( if only for its integration with mac@@ O@@ S and the func@@ tion@@ alities of H@@ and@@ les macro-@@ O@@ S / i@@ O@@ S , Au@@ to@@ film S@@ M@@ S etc . ) , but I am opening Ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ e as soon as I have to use a rather cumbersome or so@@ fis@@ ted web of application . .
The problem is that develop@@ ers are developing under Ch@@ ro@@ me ( because they have to admit that they do not have bu@@ bu@@ g@@ ger and other tools ) , so the te@@ ers are testing under Ch@@ ro@@ me ( because it is 2 / 3 of the market ) , so it is becoming the default navig@@ ator that imposes the standard .
I am instead going to give a chance to Fi@@ ref@@ o@@ x , because , in view of the various comments , it would have moved in the right direction .
I will read the article out because Ju@@ de@@ ith p@@ its me on str@@ ing .
But I am going to say what I said in relation to the pu@@ b G@@ ill@@ te :
The message was a good one , but the multinationals use good causes as a marketing tool ( not because they believe in it , just because it is going to be a sh@@ ot@@ s@@ ho@@ w and therefore a pu@@ b ) .
All the more so than moral standards , G@@ ill@@ et@@ te can go and d@@ ress , Children , and ci@@ der .

It seems that the g@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate has been closely monitoring , if you wo@@ ke up with the very dil@@ u@@ ted quantity of the quantity of it , the Sri Lan@@ k@@ an workers who bur@@ ned the water of the rice rice containing gl@@ y@@ ph@@ o@@ os@@ ate did not invent their sudden disease as soon as the That is gl@@ yp@@ ical .
I do not understand the history of this discred@@ ited resear@@ cher .
Know@@ ing the scientific method , I know very well that it is perfectly possible to prove that gl@@ y@@ ph@@ o@@ s@@ ate is not dangerous if you om@@ it s@@ ows .
I do not understand those who are defending the non-@@ prohibition of gl@@ y@@ ph@@ o@@ s@@ ate , those who support those who are in favour of this hon@@ ey@@ ed gl@@ y@@ ph@@ o@@ sphere .
It is totally ob@@ vi@@ ous that there is a j@@ uni@@ or pr@@ o g@@ y@@ ph@@ os@@ ate has hit billions of dollars .
With medicines , agriculture is the second largest trading power in the world in one sense , it is as if you decide which sal@@ t sal@@ t would buy all humans on earth .
I want to say , quite clearly , that mon@@ san@@ to has an EN@@ OR@@ M@@ E power on the studies , scientists are not a race in the mountains who live au@@ tar@@ ky in the mountains far away from the world , there are good and bad ones , and it is quite obvious that mon@@ san@@ to has been a mon@@ ster .

We are talking about so much money , it is co@@ los@@ sal , in every country of the world , rich or poor , it is an official cli@@ ent , all the countries are pushing and all the countries need to ra@@ ze the land of we@@ eds .

It is the case of Sri Lanka , of the United States , that it is a Q@@ U@@ IS V@@ A market , and I want to say that it is a Q@@ U@@ IS V@@ A market .
It is not the only limit which is so mon@@ str@@ ous . It is not the only one that poss@@ esses the essence , it is impossible to imagine the power they have .
I see the scientists who say themselves as direct , good , I have b@@ la@@ zed my life hard and have been integrated , only in my lab@@ o , and at a stro@@ ke I have been offered 10 life pay like mine just to om@@ it a detail , and I am assured that it will be so sk@@ il@@ fully that my name is not the same as my name . I will never be bri@@ ef@@ ed .
How do you want there to be not who are refusing to do so ?
It is comparable to the invention of the w@@ ashing machine with a woman at the home of the 196@@ 0s , the s@@ na@@ g is ra@@ ging in less than two , while before you were to fall into it for dozens of hours , everything had to be pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed .

With regard to the dangers .
It is quite clear that the tr@@ ick is harmful .
I understand the gallery to ban it after years of using this .

In the case of the home@@ owners , you are increasing the rent when a wild est@@ at@@ um dec@@ la@@ res everything before leaving ?
That is not a gift to me .
If they find a way of doing this they will do so without asking any questions .
I brought my daughter to the cr@@ è@@ che this morning .
barely returned to the room it is kept in , a small one is approaching and pushing it viol@@ ently ( they have every two and a half years wholesale ) and it falls well 1 me@@ tre further , leading a long way away from a wo@@ o@@ den structure .
There were three staff of the cr@@ è@@ che in this room , including the Director , all for less than 10 children .
Not a single one is re@@ reacting .
As a result , as this was the third time that the bo@@ y had been driving my daughter in front of me ( two more times another day , without a great deal of reaction either ) , it was a warm he@@ ir to me , and I began to pick up the small , with the indifference of the staff .
My daughter during that time was ter@@ r@@ ori@@ zed and did not stop m@@ our@@ ning ( a child of his age , it was easy to m@@ our@@ n , but he was really violent as a little bo@@ y ) .
Even so , I said to the Director that , if it were to start again , I wanted to talk about the parents of the little bo@@ y , which is normal .
She replied to me , &apos; but you know , it is already known , he did not know that with your daughter , he was followed by the p@@ sy , his parents know &apos; ...
I answered in substance , but I would still like to talk to the parents if it is going to happen again and she got me from a rather aggressive tone : &apos; o@@ k , but outside the cr@@ è@@ che &apos; as if I were going to put me with them .
That was a mo@@ ck@@ ery of me for the day .
Already , because it is I who is to gu@@ ess , women were passive , and also because , if this is not the first time , it is not the first time that the bo@@ y has been pushing M@@ a , even in the case .
It could be a good thing to keep us informed .
And if my daughter falls into a to@@ y or a table ?
This will be the time to talk about it when it is paraly@@ sed or worse ?

I thank you for that .
