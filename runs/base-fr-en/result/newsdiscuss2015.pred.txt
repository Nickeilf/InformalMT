The UK@@ IP &apos;s dem@@ our@@ ies that refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example .
You speak of when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism , and when , with that in mind , it responds yes when the inter@@ view@@ er asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirable .
First of all , you use specialist arguments and then dis@@ credit them by barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Wh@@ enever I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we have to qu@@ e@@ ue behind intoler@@ ant hypo@@ cr@@ ites who think that everything is due .
I believe that it is you who use specialist arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the right-wing mil@@ ls , hardly exists .
I believe that this is what is called democracy .
No one would be affected by UK@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
Only in the parallel uni@@ verse of UK@@ IP can Car@@ sw@@ ell appear a revolutionary .
There is no evidence of a quote from a tor@@ ch .
Yes , let us take the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail did not write the report , he did just comment .
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be f@@ lan@@ ked for spreading such populist propaganda as if that were the reality .
I do not think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You know nothing about my personal situation or identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
The Far@@ age sentence was a great surprise , but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem .
He made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic remark .
You will have to succeed in getting you back .
I am not of course where you want to come , but I imagine you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like .
It is so rare because , unlike Far@@ age and his fil@@ tered follow@@ ers of That@@ cher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of God , not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are something good , then no .
Finally , the situation is also ro@@ tten in Ireland .
With the new crisis that is going through the austerity period , nothing has changed .
To see almost 5 % growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
In Ireland , the T@@ I@@ O@@ P@@ E , we have been told , a few years ago .
We had the follow-up !
That is what the article says .
We are trying to make the impression that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country , and that a N@@ O@@ U@@ V@@ EC@@ E M@@ IR@@ EC@@ E is now taking place .
With the Brussels agreement , im@@ po@@ tent on Europe &apos;s lowest social society , a work of soft work , a continuing emi@@ gration .
With these beg@@ in@@ nings , it is not the case that we can make a difference at the moment with the arrival of the Poles .
In the 1980s of the twentieth century , the ir@@ on@@ ization was one of the poorest countries of the Euro@@ pa union , with the Portuguese in view of a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without the new countries , the situation is always better than it was .
The Gre@@ y was before .
The fact that their development is not a long , calm river is in the light of the recent sc@@ ales .
Europe &apos;s lowest im@@ po@@ ts ?
That is not true !
Latvia has an im@@ po@@ t rate of 0 % on companies .
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the im@@ po@@ ts paid by the multinationals .
According to a report in 2008 or 2009 , they pay less than 5 % in France .
Only SMEs are paying a full price .
Now I confirm that road tr@@ acking has become en@@ gen@@ ial , and there are new cars ( and che@@ er ) is all around the street , just as before the 2008 crisis .
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years , the recovery has been evident in the daily but@@ tons since entry .
Is it supposed to be economic ?
Do not worry , I am sure that the comments will soon get bo@@ gged down .
In another article that they are writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ ha@@ l A@@ str@@ a is involved in a c@@ up on the A@@ 140 .
Is R@@ y@@ an@@ air now going to transfer passengers from one flight to another ?
I believe that Mr O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon be buying a new fleet of appli@@ ances , so a few b@@ ones and stra@@ ins on the old will soon be forgotten .
Having said that , I will vote with him next week , so I hope that it will not be on one of these people once again .
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot .
Did R@@ y@@ an@@ air pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that was intended to provide them ?
But , without such Irish companies , you could not allow you to go on holiday , a young man .
I have never taken R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the last three times I took the plane was with B@@ A .
I prefer the airline .
No , but it is R@@ y@@ an@@ air , then they can be very happy .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air unle@@ ashes tens of comments from people who would never take R@@ y@@ an@@ air in the place of those who like to take R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay other than the basic tariff have only to take on themselves , etc .
It is quite transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air will not be happy with the additional costs of this incident .
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and , if so , if R@@ y@@ an@@ air will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers have been put in another plane in less than an hour , they have no right to compensation .
De@@ ar to dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to the British Air@@ ways flight that takes the English I@@ SIS in Syria , not true as you say .
Good journey
Last Sunday in Paris , the streets of the Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is people : the Mar@@ ine is largely pi@@ pe , and literally groups of world .
People do not come as a mass for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( most of them , for the most ) or for the Sal@@ on of the review in the B@@ lan@@ g@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ u area ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly d@@ ust ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that shops are all open and that the area is incredibly lively and lively .
With many foreigners who spend ...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs ?
G@@ o Paris R@@ ue from Fran@@ cs Bour@@ ge@@ is , where the shops are open on the Sunday , full of the world with 50 % tourists .
L@@ ong F@@ to !
The only argument that seems to me to be admissible is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists , and it is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they buy a tax .
The tourist areas are losing a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons .
The industry where expensive equipment , which is used on the Sunday , makes it possible to lower prices .
D@@ in@@ e-@@ rest rest is a right which , apart from exceptions , employees enjoy .
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code .
Neither the Minister for the Econom@@ y nor , indeed , the foreign affairs minister , have any competence to reform the Labour Code .
As they move .
The law serves what ?
To satisfy a section of the population and businesses that want to work on the Sunday .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al on Sunday , I take my small children to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my V@@ ille of 30@@ ,000 inhabitants in France , the Bi@@ b@@ lical Bi@@ ble is open 4 days a week but not the w@@ ound !
It is access to culture ...
And it is also the regulation of working time .
The lifestyle that he defended with ten@@ acity against fascism
The way of life he defended with ten@@ acity against fascism and Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ vis@@ m
And if the succession of his daughter was , against his will , used to pay for inher@@ it@@ ance costs ?
There are pain@@ tings .
Some are well , some not terrible .
Perhaps his succession would like his part of the ca@@ ke , if you get the expression .
His preference for a victory of the nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And its hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
Nor do I .
For five years , and only for five years , it was perfect .
In 19@@ 40 , he led the other ar@@ ts of the government to discuss an agreement with the Naz@@ is and he was very sk@@ il@@ ful .
Thanks to his wonderful rhetoric and energy , he united the country in the idea that fighting against fasc@@ ists was the only way to win .
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom , and France , and Belgium , and , ultimately , the whole world , may thank you for having had over these five years , just those five years , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the hel@@ m and no other .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
Whether their des@@ c@@ endants sell pain@@ ts on the free market to raise the money for inher@@ it@@ ance costs , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to be able to ad@@ mire one in a mus@@ e@@ um , that they bring money to buy it .
That is just as simple .
But we could use tax money .
Nobody can deny that , when it was &apos; the moment of truth &apos; , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by avoiding hi@@ ring , with infrastructure building , by definition , not renewable .
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister , they reflect the real mis@@ carri@@ age : distrust of dialogue with dialogue .
Re@@ turn to the values that are pr@@ one .
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory .
The weakest of us are not in need !
Either in solidarity we come to the aid , or it has D@@ R@@ ILO in exchange for the services that it makes or made to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H , which I prefer to see , corresponds to this vision .
There is also the donor who lives on income from his properties .
There is a need to differenti@@ ate the person who in@@ ve@@ sts for a return to retirement and the person who lives .
It is a good thing to praise or even two for a couple .
The small gen@@ i@@ us of the fund is sing@@ ul@@ arly lacking in imagination .
The new deal was a policy of great work , but at a time of defici@@ ency in large infrastructure .
Today , in Europe and France , this is not the case .
The developed countries are su@@ c@@ ked .
The need for infrastructure is marginal , therefore , in nothing .
Especially at a time when the issue of growth is emerging in response to a recession that is only sav@@ age sav@@ age and sav@@ age growth .
You would have been right 30 years ago : more need ( or possibilities ) of dam@@ s , coal mines , motorways ...
But if we want to make the future climate shock less difficult , then the need for investment is glar@@ ing : insul@@ ation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transport and storage of energy .
A tax that favours high incomes and r@@ allies .
Who is in power ?
Ob@@ se@@ ated by the s@@ mar@@ ph@@ ph@@ es .
Charles Ar@@ th@@ ur is really a gal@@ op@@ ian .
The benefits of Sam@@ sun@@ g are being undermined by the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and its competitors at the same end .
By the middle of September , Ap@@ ple control over the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and 6 plus may have attracted bu@@ yers who would otherwise have bought a Gal@@ ax@@ y .
I tested all these tele@@ phones and decided for G@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a customer , but not for Ap@@ ple .
I think we need an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft put this philosophy in place , we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google , Ap@@ ple and the op@@ ponent community .
We need to have several dynamic platforms , to stimulate competition and development .
In addition , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied with one manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
For me , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design .
Some people do not attach any value to design , for them options , func@@ tionality and prices .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let us stop looking for a better platform .
There is &apos; a better car manufacturer &apos; , not really , they are different , but similar .
I would like to see a flour@@ ishing port@@ able industry , with radically different approaches to different people and markets .
This is healthier and must be encouraged .
That is in all our interests .
I am pleased that you have found exactly what you are seeking and that it is not a Ap@@ ple product , even though I have made a different choice .
Most people I know have i@@ Ph@@ s .
Our U@@ p@@ hal@@ ist friends who , according to one of them , are fighting ideas and not men ( on the contrary , well on Paris &apos;s b@@ ob@@ s ) could tell us what ( the author ) if they fight ideas on gender and tell us what works they want to combat .
Or are they just attacking the kind described in Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te or Val@@ tors A@@ ca@@ es ?
Their sources are Jud@@ th Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ our ?
Well , John , I like you well , and you are an intelligent and cultiv@@ ated .
I said that on Ju@@ di@@ outh in the F@@ u@@ us@@ ato ve@@ in , which spoke about Hol@@ op@@ er@@ ne , a rapprochement that did not come to me ( I do not have his vi@@ vi@@ ity ) .
Otherwise , in the &apos; substance &apos; , since you refer to it , I am not interested in this subject , and I really do not see what the problem is : I was hoping that you and your friends could get out of my arre@@ ars , because I am slow but I understand ...
@ Jean : recognise that , cul@@ turally , we send back to Hol@@ oph@@ er@@ ne , that is the case .
Who is afraid of the Mon@@ de ?
But what is the fear of those who are afraid ?
F@@ ur@@ as@@ to and @ us give us some answers .
The first by invo@@ king the Ju@@ dic@@ ial of the Bi@@ ble , the second by describing Ju@@ dic@@ th Bu@@ t@@ ler as a very symbolic to@@ y .
We see how in@@ tim@@ ate these studies are at home .
We are , of course , no longer in the debate .
That is much deeper .
Did you read , John , that the Mon@@ de published an article on the need for the@@ ology ?
When it comes to a debate on the idea , I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources .
To seek to combat ideas from the only statement that their critics are making ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ atz@@ inger , inven@@ tor of the The@@ ori@@ a of Gen@@ re or X L@@ ac@@ passing , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ ans ) does not seem very rigorous .
But it is good , as I explained to our P@@ um@@ pe@@ li@@ an friend , that the difference between having an enligh@@ tened opinion and a simple opinion .
I am not , moreover , aware of the nu@@ ance .
I have not read Ju@@ di@@ th , the very symbolic br@@ ass of g@@ or@@ ge , I have just got the &apos; Second sex &apos; ( that was more than my time ) , which I believe is the source of &apos; source &apos; in the wishes of L@@ o .
As I watched the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se since M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , I saw red lights when the mo@@ on was briefly shown when the cl@@ ou@@ ds were open .
This sudden appearance of the red mo@@ on had its char@@ m and compensated a little for disappointment at sometimes having the view blocked by the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
It was wonderful here in F@@ N@@ Q .
Yes , last night &apos;s cl@@ oud would really bur@@ y the coast of Vic@@ tor@@ ia and N@@ S@@ W , while most of Australia had a clear time .
Special blood@@ shed .
Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t / Jo@@ e H@@ c@@ key make the Lab@@ or responsible .
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget , we will give it its true colour as soon as possible .
Do you not ?
I was in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne then , of course , I saw only cl@@ ou@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne has also managed to cover the whole week of the me@@ te@@ id rain rain and virtually all of the important phenomena of recent years .
I begin to think that there is a bad gen@@ i@@ us whose sole aim is to prevent the people of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything from the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an observatory , even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the C@@ ore@@ l@@ il@@ a .
There were periods of 10@@ -@@ 20 minutes when I could not see ec@@ li@@ p@@ se because of the cl@@ ou@@ ds over the sub@@ ur@@ bs of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
I will put a TA@@ X@@ E on this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se .
Q@@ U@@ I@@ CO@@ Q@@ EU is looking at this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se .
I be@@ t that your first thought of the day is for Ab@@ bot@@ t , just like the last one before you sin@@ k .
Who or what will you get when it ends ( necessarily ) ?
It seems that you are taking a long time to read the discussions by seeking messages in which people criticise the Ab@@ bot@@ t Government and then accuse them of being obs@@ essed .

There is nothing about stock market speculation and buildings .
There is nothing about inequalities between income and capital .
Nothing about tax fraud .
ultra-@@ liberalism is killing Europe .
Nothing about B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on &apos;s g@@ ard@@ ens ...
The article says too much or not enough .
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given .
No hy@@ per@@ a link to documents of origin so that an opinion can be made .
To see today , Tuesday , 15 October , the results of mirac@@ les : in Spain , exports have been at the lowest for five years .
In Greece , the stock market collap@@ ses .
Yet it was there that there were examples .
The reform of no@@ tar@@ ies would generate a request for compensation of EUR 8 billion .
The Ministry of Econom@@ y tells us that these claims are not justified .
What about the Ministry of Econom@@ ics ?
Will the decision makers have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack by the no@@ tar@@ ies will have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget ?
The next step is .
O@@ h , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ...
It is not the case that the state is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget , because the time horizon of the state is theore@@ tically infin@@ itely infin@@ ite , while that of the household is restricted by the life of its members .
In addition , unless public expenditure is un@@ productive , they contribute to financing material and int@@ an@@ gible investment in tomorrow &apos;s growth and thus future revenue .
A few points of response .
A regrettable decision .
But remember the sac@@ red s@@ na@@ p of Hi@@ p@@ po@@ crates : the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all .
Jo@@ lie theory .
Unfortunately , the truth is not your fant@@ asy .
Med@@ ical staff would like to be able to use it , but they have the hands of the law as written by the policies .
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions , rather than having risky sur@@ gical interventions , safe ho@@ t rooms for drug addic@@ ts , rather than having them on the streets , etc .
On these issues politicians want to be happy with the m@@ asses .
In fact , doctors do not earn money with medicines .
That is why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors do not earn money with medicines , as Liberals want our health system to resemb@@ le that of the United States , you should tell you how it works .
Do@@ c@@ tors throughout the world are cour@@ ted in the same way , but it is more or less visible .
Perhaps it was wrong to put the blame on the B@@ loc@@ ks , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to business profits and research .
So let us read the few reports on our expenditure on P@@ harm@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ em@@ e and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ing world prices for medicines everywhere , as well as the differences between countries on what is free or only on prescri@@ ption .
This is a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific process , direct or indirect .
In fact , some companies are currently carrying out tests on mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ ations against on@@ co@@ logical pain , despite the laws that are hin@@ dering them and the on@@ erous permits required .
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as mari@@ ju@@ ana , those who arrive at a version offering good quality products to known do@@ ses will benefit greatly .
You can tell you that , but you are wrong , there is a lot in the back@@ room for doctors and pharmac@@ ists .
As for this hospital , they were happy to use it until someone ca@@ res the chi@@ p on a hospital head .
E@@ T@@ U@@ N@@ IT@@ I@@ R should not be allowed on grass .
If &apos; researchers &apos; in social science were to make research instead of making politics and net@@ working , we could use their &apos; work &apos; .
A resear@@ cher investigation does not compare one thing with another .
Com@@ par@@ ing that is not the case .
Com@@ par@@ ing it is making the teaching of research not .
It cannot be said that research is successful , and then in the same j@@ et &apos; we must experiment with everything &apos; .
If your research is successful why experiment ?
If your research is not successful , why are you asking you to apply them ?
Can I explain how a &apos; resear@@ cher &apos; can de@@ duce that a pup@@ il who cannot as@@ simil@@ ate mathema@@ tics alone could make mathema@@ tics and other matters easier ?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that pupils learn to use new technologies , but how will they manage to learn new technologies if they cannot learn ?
The test tests are only an indicator that will allow us to find indicators that are satisfactory .
What is the point of building an indicator that in@@ forms you of what suits you , a desire for promotion , a dec@@ eption ?
One way to train teachers is to move away from the training of the pro@@ x@@ ies and ideolo@@ gues and teach practi@@ tioners .
Let us make the paragraph on tra@@ ine@@ es ( which unfortunately is not very well argued ) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conser@@ va@@ tism : &apos; it is a mechanism that leads to the reproduction of the practices in force , and does not allow the system to move forward .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , it cannot be hoped that only practi@@ tioners will teach practi@@ tioners , even if they have their rightful place in modern teacher training teachers .
Education the@@ or@@ ists must have no place .
The practi@@ tioners must have one .
Do you wish to be carried out by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and which has never been set up in an oper@@ a bloc ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the education system .
Gi@@ ving more weight to educational the@@ or@@ ists would be to destroy it definitively .
Your analo@@ gy is entirely cra@@ zy : if I do not want to be made by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has only a theoretical training , I would like to make even less use of a sur@@ ge@@ on who has no theoretical training and who has learnt about it .

Thank you .
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright , I will have to read an article like this .
In an information economy , the violation of copyright is being violated .
That is the same thing as they must name their sources properly .
Often , obtaining a licence costs nothing .
No , it is a violation of copyright .
Not at all .
By using the content without having the right licence , you are depriving artists of their livelihoods .
You can always discuss educational assumptions - but it is flight .
You can repeat it as much as you will , but that will not be the case .
It is a violation of copyright .
Please repeat it .
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright law .
It does not help you to deprive artists of their income .
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties , an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use , then I am pleased to deprive them of this fic@@ ti@@ tious income .
lesson no 1 should be to show how , if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their fav@@ our@@ ite social networks , they abandon intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed from a c@@ lic@@ k .
Perhaps if they share the head@@ phones of their m@@ 3 bul@@ l with a cop@@ y in school buses , they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way .
If we could export this resource to which we are full , the r@@ ass that says that everything goes wrong ...
If it is a PS Member who says so , then we must believe it .
I have two children and when they are in the age of choice I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then .
France is pul@@ ling people down by constantly assisting them .
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created .
What is taking France to the bottom is speeches like yours .
I have always been a private company .
I had the C@@ H@@ A@@ N@@ CE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders : it exists in France but it is rare .
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to lead a company and that choice allows me to sho@@ ot down on the spo@@ ils that I frequently encounter .
In my bas@@ ke@@ ys , I fully agree with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ j@@ iz@@ an : he says the horri@@ ble truth !
If you compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly call for reforms in France , in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric in order to make it competitive , particularly by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French bos@@ s waiting for ?
What does the state hold to them ?
Is this state that they are guilty of ?
@ Jacques L@@ .
Still on your side !
Rem@@ ember , what are you created as jobs , as added value , to be so severe ?
I understand your reaction .
In fact , France is faced with an in@@ solu@@ ble problem : the in@@ competence of the French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are moving and undermining while awaiting the permanent state of the state !
That is terrible !
But they have solutions : abolishing the Labour Code , employers &apos; charges , taxes , working 4@@ 5@@ th / week paid 35 , and some , wal@@ king on eggs , dare to call for a reduction in wages , not to be abolished !
I look forward to seeing all the &apos; negative &apos; comments on this subject .
What is ironic is the way people are still complaining about F@@ ir@@ st Group .
As I see it , L@@ as@@ t has not really been an investment for us taxpayers .
They have tried to keep af@@ lo@@ at rather than turn .
It does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since L@@ aw@@ t .
But they had also improved with their predecessors , including British R@@ ail .
Unfortunately , we do not have the power to do that , unfortunately .
I tried to do so recently , but I did not succeed .
However , the L@@ ower will get us out of trouble .
It is an international subsidiary .
They already operate trains in Germany .
There is nothing to stop people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in ten@@ ders .
But it seems that we are not very good in management , most of our priv@@ ati@@ sed services end up being managed by a foreign operator .
I still remember the scandal and criticism when F@@ ir@@ st won the Vir@@ g@@ in contract , so that the decision was finally cancelled .
And there is better : M@@ T@@ R , a company in Hong Kong won the S@@ C@@ M for 8 years .
Well , Labour , as they have told us during the referendum campaign , is completely in favour of po@@ oling and sharing and believes that the workers must all help themselves across borders .
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision .
Perhaps it is because Dutch management is on good track when that of the British is not .
What S@@ co@@ t@@ R@@ ail needs is not simply a change of ownership but , above all , new ideas .
A@@ bel@@ li@@ o may be the least bad choice , but the real problem is the ridiculous system of crossing , not the cross .
&apos;@@ He was a figh@@ ter &apos; .
I was in favour of it , but I was very happy with it .
To assume that being &apos; beaten &apos; is a better quality than many others , the concern of others , intelligence , listening , for example , the fact that being &apos; beaten &apos; has nothing to do with that of survi@@ ving a disease : &apos; batter@@ y &apos; cancer , which is no less dead .
S@@ pending a disease has nothing to do with merit .
Let us also start again .
I say to you that it is L@@ A condition for the management , I tell you that it is F@@ DI .
Nothing has any merit ...
When you look at your life , you can judge them .
I repeat .
It is quite simply mon@@ str@@ ous that we should not be able to get the credit out of a disease or that it can be und@@ one not to get out of it .
The body follows or does not follow .
A body that is cowar@@ dly , in spite of the will , despite confidence in medicine , has a vague idea of what C is ?
N@@ ed to think otherwise , if a solid mor@@ ale is likely to make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it , to try experimental treatments as this woman did , and not to reject them by fear .
Some@@ one who is beaten in medicine is above all someone who tru@@ sts medicine .
But if you prefer to get back to the &apos; l@@ ord &apos; that is something else .
Neither with merit nor with courage .
These considerations are a matter for mor@@ alists .
When you catch a sal@@ v@@ age , a real , you have got to the point of becoming a z@@ om@@ bi@@ e .
I personally caught two , sal@@ t , big , and if I have &apos; beaten &apos; as these psycho@@ log@@ ists say , it has completely escap@@ ed me .
Unless this fight is only to b@@ end te@@ eth , to suffer the hell and to bur@@ y the b@@ lows .
I believed that the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised ten years ago .
I have not seen this name in the newspapers at least .
What is happening ?
It is an anniversary .
A forgotten anniversary .
His trial was conducted &apos; quickly &apos; and then swept under the car@@ pet .
Is it the story that was said at the time ?
The communist communist that triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade ?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
So please ask what has been deliberately left aside : 1 .
How could the bombing of NATO be legal under M@@ A M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ R@@ E rule of international law ?
What country has Serbia attacked ?
With regard to R@@ TS ( Rad@@ io Tele@@ visited Ser@@ bi@@ a ) , why do you not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target ?
Milosevic had no way out : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , he would be cru@@ ci@@ fied as a tra@@ itor .
And if he defended it , he would be sw@@ ay@@ ed by the Western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
The West used a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en to de@@ part part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally declared its independence and was virtually recognised by the Western states who then li@@ ed to the end of the situation on the ground .
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , died politically after his first mandate for failing to understand the situation that had developed .
Z@@ or@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time .
In the end , the Guar@@ dian should not describe Milosevic as a ty@@ rant ( even if we do not like it ) .
As far as I am aware , there is only one method of predic@@ tion of earthquakes in Greece , measuring the pi@@ tiful level in the Quartet .
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results .
So there is a hope , but caution has nothing to do with the ex@@ op@@ lic@@ et named H@@ A@@ T@@ -@@ P-@@ 1@@ 1@@ b , located around 1@@ 24 years of the earth in the C@@ y@@ gn@@ us con@@ st@@ ellation that would be &apos; the smallest and col@@ dest planet to present detec@@ table m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules &apos; , according to a study conducted by the D@@ rak@@ e D@@ ing and J@@ on@@ a@@ than F@@ ra@@ ine University of the University of Mar@@ y@@ land .
So we are going to follow .
Like those that involve animals , there is a threat .
Thank you for the science of reg@@ ain@@ ing us , often , of these experimental achievements in the world .
How will animals be saved ( in advance ) ?
There is no doubt that there are other elements that are changing in the event of earthquake .
For example .
A pri@@ ori that is in@@ od@@ ore for man but perhaps can be found by animals .
All these methods are inde@@ fen@@ sible for man , but not for the measuring instruments .
However , we do not have a reliable outcome on these paths ...
It has been repeatedly observed ( and for centuries ) that some animals act in a strange way a few hours with an earthquake , especially the h@@ ens , cows , dogs but , above all , fish and s@@ miles .
I had seen a re@@ port@@ ering of two scientific teams , a ca@@ li@@ dr@@ ine , the other Japanese , in order to recognise the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the land mag@@ netic fields , and , in particular , to their modification before a se@@ a@@ tism .
Well , I am not scientific , but their assumptions convinced me !
Or is this research ?
Why is so much contempt for this ?
We should learn to hear the nature ...
If you look at things cal@@ m@@ ly and rigorously , we publish it in a serious jour@@ nal , and no one is mistaken .
As soon as we talk about the &apos; signs &apos; given by animals , there is one thing in the same way : everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the red fish were stran@@ ded in circles .
I do not understand why we can think that Bor@@ is would be a good leader for the Conservatives .
He did too much as a may@@ or of London .
When you listen to the L@@ BC programme we cannot stop thinking that this man knows nothing and that he is always trying to diver@@ ge with a jo@@ ke .
It is never directly answered .
He also said he was in agreement with Far@@ age , and then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari has asked him what .
He could not name a single point .
He made so many promises to get elected as a may@@ or and he did not hold one .
It only serves to underline the fact that the rest of the Conservative Party is only a mass of mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ e .
Because it is popular .
Because it is fun@@ ny .
He was in &apos; H@@ a@@ ve I Ne@@ ws &apos; .
Because it is a celebr@@ ity and people have been charged with the ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ation of cele@@ bri@@ ties .
The L@@ on@@ on@@ ians voted for it , and the same applies to the rest of the country .
When - and not if - he takes the leadership of the party , the popularity ratings of the T@@ ories will go down the ceiling .
Let us God help .
I am not so sure : people love the jo@@ kes , but do not want their prime minister to be one of them .
That is exactly what L@@ on@@ don@@ ians said .
He should have brought his friend the par@@ p@@ ain@@ s , smar@@ ter than he was , to him .
In many respects , I think it is trying to copy R B@@ ran@@ son R B@@ ran@@ son

Good evening I think that the red tape that has been shown against taxes is happy to know that this journey is sponsored by the British region and the V@@ ille de Br@@ est .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies in any way should not devote a pen@@ ny of our taxes to finance the dreams of a few ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous ad@@ ven@@ tures - that is the case !
Are there any players in the current Serbian training of Kosovo ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , formerly in the Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now in the Fac@@ er@@ b@@ ç@@ e , are Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I do not know if they are still in the team in the team .

B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic was middle ground or before the 1970s and 1980s , and led to many teams in Greece , but I do not know where it is .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic is Mo@@ star , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and played as an attack in the great team of Vel@@ ez who , under the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary of the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary S@@ ul@@ em@@ an Re@@ b@@ c , ended twice in the Yugoslav le@@ ague ( and also had points such as V@@ a@@ hi@@ d H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ z@@ ic and the faithful crews of Ar@@ sen@@ e W@@ eng@@ er , Bor@@ o Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c ) .

Of course I know H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and Pri@@ mor@@ ic .
Just by cu@@ ri@@ osity , what happened to K@@ ra@@ si@@ c ?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Ju@@ ve , he is currently in Turkey , but the last time he appeared on my ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en was linked to Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n .
I cannot help you here .
I know he lost his place when he arrived , then he went to the Fol@@ er and as far as I know he was not .
Perhaps something can still be done , perhaps in the Indian Su@@ per League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Sim@@ ply , Albania is not afraid .
You should love Albania because you are neighbours .
The point is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of true Albania today .
Ap@@ parently it was the flag of the Greater Albania , which encomp@@ asses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
A bit of excessive nationalism , in fact .
Fortunately , there was not too much damage ( I know ) .
In fact , it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is known as the Gr@@ and Albania , but of Albania before 19@@ 13 , when the major European powers decided to hand over the country to neighbouring countries .
How can we have felt &apos; an explosion of joy &apos; by seeing two rounds collap@@ sing in the knowledge that women , men and people who have no doubt children are inside ?
How ?
What bo@@ thers me a little in this &apos; testi@@ mony &apos; is that the only fact of having been able , if only once , to rejo@@ ice at the horri@@ ble death of thousands of people , is testi@@ mony to a figure that is &apos; sub@@ der &apos; , of which all &apos; testi@@ monies &apos; should be taken with great care .
There is no doubt that in the short term of &apos; joy &apos; we will not have thought about the deaths or the reality of the horror inflicted .
It was just thought , for a moment , that , for once , Muslims had managed to make a real and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic contribution to the big S@@ at@@ an in its very heart .

It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims with their sense of humiliation .
With film reports in Palestine .

There was a little doubt .
The &apos; Christian / white / legal &apos; West cannot measure the degree of che@@ ating , anger and hatred of mu@@ m@@ man when it con@@ tests the he@@ i@@ ghts of poverty , the social and cultural under@@ development of the Muslim Arab@@ ic world of today .
I am talking about the mistakes of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not the tow@@ ers of Du@@ ba@@ i .
The past s@@ len@@ der , certainly mag@@ ni@@ fied , is not a cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How can we get the Muslim world out of this evil agreement ?
T@@ ot@@ ally in stage , two major pois@@ ons are irrit@@ ating the Arab world : the bi@@ go@@ try conser@@ va@@ tism of the powers in place and the fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common point , the freezing of thought and ex@@ communication ( soft or army ) of its critical expression .
It should be understood that it should not take Muslims back .
That is the only way .
Did you read this article ?
I suppose that is true in many countries .
But in Britain , the autumn marks the beginning of six long , hum@@ ble and de@@ pressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people .
In addition , everyone is falling ill .
seasonal pressure .
I am suffering from that myself .
When the light goes , it becomes hell for me and those like me .
A do@@ se of vitam@@ in D should help a little for mood and welfare .
The autumn is beautiful in Britain , with or without rain .
The campaign in particular is to break the b@@ reath in the autumn .
Not so much to b@@ end the b@@ reath as the green light when everything is living instead of being about to die .
In Britain , if you are lucky , the summer comes at a weekend .
We have had a good summer this year , do not do your gr@@ in@@ ding that is giving the c@@ lic@@ h@@ és !
Not everyone .
I am rarely ill in winter .
But now I am reti@@ ring and I am not developing any immunity to the ger@@ ms of the outside , that can change , I suppose .
It is not about to die , it is just a step in a cycle ...
A mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous step full of en@@ cro@@ aching o@@ sts , with a fe@@ at that culmin@@ ates with f@@ es@@ tiv@@ als like H@@ all@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , the risks of en@@ cro@@ aching and full of other wonderful words .
You need not stop doing things !
These are my recommendations for you .
Yes , these dark and grey months actually make me much happ@@ ier and more rela@@ xed .
In the case of the taxation of children &apos;s inc@@ rements , it is the amount of money that the state is receiving , mainly from the decisions of 8 to 10 .
However , with regard to the number of households who have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the 4 and 5 dec@@ lines that are affected ( medi@@ an income ) according to 2 .
The deletion of half a year on wid@@ ows is not dealt with at all in the article or , rather , its impact is supplemented by an assessment : EUR 2@@ 30@@ M is a jo@@ ke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is in@@ dol@@ ent .
And it is not prepared to get off the ground .
Well , we are not on the do@@ or@@ step , but let us think about it .
For once the S@@ PS has a rather left-wing policy , we will not cry ...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20 % must bear more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let us continue to do so and you will encourage the 20 % less work or leave .
Well , I know that it is not politically correct , but I say it nonetheless .
T@@ ow@@ ards the recyc@@ led Tro@@ ts and O@@ C@@ O@@ I to the PS : they have understood everything .
You can see what you are looking at .
The proportion is always the same , both here and in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population holds 80 % of the wealth .
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from am@@ assing as much as he can .
Beyond a certain amount of money , the money is losing all its usefulness .
Once the money has been exceeded , money is no longer used only to make money , that is to say , to make the most of the misery .
One of the richest 20 % .
There is also no doubt that the 20 % of households that work most ( and create wealth which is logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must enable these households to benefit from some of their efforts .
Or , then , let us reduce the arms and live social minimum , especially if we have social housing .
Fortunately , the ut@@ op@@ ia of the heads of heads in the red k@@ n@@ ail have lived .
I did two Air@@ B@@ B in Norway recently .
No problem .
In one of the two , we have had things that we would not have had in a hot@@ els 5 st@@ ars and we have not had to come to the receiving end or face any trace .
It is enough to go to someone , to sle@@ ep , to side behind and to leave .
From now on this will be my first option when I travel .
The lo@@ go has changed , people ...
Take your assurance before you praise your house .
In most cases , you will need a kind of insurance insurance .

I love Airbus .
&apos;@@ This is very dangerous and highly risky &apos; .
You have just missed a chance .
According to the link provided in the article :
In its discharge , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to T@@ em@@ an was quick , almost absurd .
In 24 hours , according to an e-mail supplied to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b sent a r@@ ur@@ ring to change the r@@ acks , made provisions to spend a week on ho@@ tel and transferred $ 23 8@@ 17 ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b was assured , but still ) .
So why is this Article T@@ em@@ an complaining that he has received no support from Airbus ?
I have to say that I should like to travel as to travel as to travel to travel as to travel .
I am looking for people who have already used b@@ n@@ b just to reassure me .
I am planning to pay an ac@@ id and a month to rent , but I am rather afraid to send GBP 1 600 to a site that I have never heard about .
But where is it going ?
&apos;@@ Sup@@ porting troops &apos; , s@@ inging the B@@ u on all of us ...
So harm@@ less .
I am sure that it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in h@@ al@@ ab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends succum@@ bed to anything other than the chemical bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment of s@@ ad@@ d@@ ressing .
Unless the content of the article has been radically amended by the author , your comment is in@@ und@@ ated ( to remain pol@@ ite ) .
Moreover , what is the mass crime committed in 1988 to prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
It is not a matter of hy@@ per@@ -@@ style style : &apos; to seek weapons of mass destruction .
We agree .
You believe that it is the time to weaken the army in order to strengthen education .
This is never the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively : is it a time for strengthening education , because we are still at war ?
A great deal of education would already be strengthened if we were &apos; the &apos; to work 35 hours instead of 17 .
Today , our teachers are currently earning more than engineers .
And we do not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing for their programme .
But that is not the case , because the National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the College / ly@@ gradu@@ ate to its pro@@ s .
A sort of forced tele@@ working , except that the employer pays neither the computer nor the Internet connection , nor the supplies .
Moreover , it is so much the pl@@ ate at 17@@ .@@ 00 a week and 4 months of holidays that we are not going to meet the M@@ P@@ B@@ s of m@@ a@@ th@@ s , you are expected .
How do you not want to col@@ lude you with poorly educated chi@@ pp@@ ers whose parents hold you over by treating you as a matter ?
I believe that the priority in this area is to dis@@ arm ji@@ ha@@ d@@ is so that the k@@ ur@@ u population can develop better .
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything .
My first job gradu@@ ated was in the sale , in London , to earn three times , and yet it was a job for which a qualification was needed .
A year later , I saw an announcement to be open for the London underground , it was paid GBP 5 000 more per year , and not even the patent was asked .
I have never regret@@ ted .
In this regard , you do not do so if you do not find a gradu@@ ated job , try to find something that is going well , or you like .
If I had remained in the job , I would still have to pay my student loan student .
I do not like the work in business so I hope to be in the public service in the long term or in the academic world .
L@@ L@@ L L@@ O@@ L L@@ .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly , when I obtained my qualification in 2011 , there was already a three-year back@@ lo@@ g .
The best way to reduce the number of gradu@@ ates unemployed ?
To get rid of the b@@ is@@ cu@@ t networks like art / letters / theat@@ er / media / political science / science is to say what is known as the unemployed .
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished production .
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree of qualification but , as the above article says , a good professional journey , starting at school and throughout the university .
Admittedly , the original wage was lower , but we are rapidly increasing the levels because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge .
This study of artistic engineering / work has been going on for years .
Scienti@@ sts cannot solve all the problems , it is more important to be able to rise the morning , to get to work at the moment and to inter@@ act with people in order to achieve results .
L@@ it@@ tle , philosophy and art are b@@ is@@ ks ?
That is ridiculous .
I assume that you are talking about the kind of study of the media , or whatever the ab@@ sen@@ tee sector , where you have gone .
L@@ it@@ tle , philosophy , political science and art are real channels .
We need people to be able to explain the major issues at school , which understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature , art and so on , and put them in value .
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to dis@@ integrate Paris and boost the rest of France ?
Personally , I find it difficult to see the people of the bottom of the Es@@ s@@ on@@ ne and the V@@ al-@@ de O@@ ise making 8@@ 0@@ km aller@@ rel@@ s every day in bic@@ ycle to work in Paris .
In@@ tra@@ -@@ m@@ ou@@ ths and small bel@@ ts already have many means of transport in common in a different way ( me@@ tr@@ o , bus , tra@@ ms ) .
A number of secure and closed par@@ ks , as already exists in the cities of northern Europe , in Di@@ j@@ on or L@@ y@@ on , will be inst@@ alled in the ve@@ il .
Good .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the 2@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , it is hoped that the City of Paris works with professionals in the Netherlands and Denmark .
So much experience in this area .
Well , there has been no room for U@@ N S@@ E@@ U@@ L as a mechanism for c@@ iling bic@@ yc@@ les .
The motivation seems to be stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ d Del@@ an@@ o@@ in ...
Well , that is not at all .
When we talk about pedestri@@ ans and other public transport users of the reasons why they do not ped@@ dle it , I think the main reasons are : 1 / c is hy@@ per@@ -@@ dangerous with all these animals , these tr@@ uc@@ ks , these fast-@@ moving sco@@ o@@ ters , and the survival of bic@@ yc@@ les 2 / you are running out of pollution at the top of the road , and we have to reduce the road traffic system .
The bic@@ ycle paths are apar@@ theid , we have to live together but re@@ balance the occupation of urban space .
Nothing about the bic@@ ycle in the great Paris ?
Not a word on the place of bic@@ yc@@ les in public transport ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .
The target of 15 % in vel@@ o is ridiculous .

Before the rac@@ ket begins , it would be better to find who is really behind this massacre .
This is not Russia .
Not sure how the world is developing .
It is horri@@ ble .
My children are not a financial asset .
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case to the EC@@ HR , but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been lod@@ ged .
In addition , they should be lod@@ ged first in Germany or Ukraine .
I also expect that these cases will be postponed until the outcome of the report of inquiry into the accident and the criminal investigation that would ensu@@ e .
It was not , but Libya did not blow up P@@ an A@@ m 103 either .
Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a Air@@ lines is not wrong , the fault lies with the authority responsible for air space security , in this case the Ukrainian Government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had been slaughtered earlier , Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels and any aeroplan@@ e could of course be regarded as a possible and immediate threat .
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people in order for the airlines to pay the right to over@@ flying the territory ?
Where are all the pro-@@ Ki@@ ev tro@@ l@@ ls that defend their u@@ sur@@ ste@@ al government and the ultra-@@ nation@@ alists in Western Ukraine - and who want to show that Putin has shot the M@@ H@@ 17 flight ?
As far as I know , there is already a complaint against the Ki@@ ev Government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sk@@ ies .
The precedent : a 1986 judgment by the International Court of Justice , which concluded that the use of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions .
There is no chance that Russia will leave this case to the IC@@ J .
It is fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t wants to tell Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia .
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations .
Until now , the investig@@ ators have not said anything like that .
To call Ri@@ car@@ do and to be such a ben@@ evol@@ ence , it is dist@@ ressing !
To call Pol@@ aire is to lose the north .
There is just one question : is the poor today poorer than the poor of yesterday ?
I can only say that those who criticise the most vir@@ ulent of the Pi@@ ke@@ tty Bo@@ ok have not read it !
It is easy to read , I have made a few days .
It shows the statistical development of res@@ cu@@ -@@ production , res@@ ale capital , unequal concentration , inequality of labour income , capital ownership , deserves and inher@@ it@@ ance in the lo@@ g .
It shows that today &apos;s concentration of capital is in line with that of the beginning of the 20 ° before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it was the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital , from 19@@ 14 to 1945 , and then the concentration takes place after ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : you are not doing what .
I ask you how long it took you to read this pa@@ ved , knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has some limits .
Secondly , the question is not whether it is easy to read .
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis of the press is right or not .
If it is right , we can debate it without having read the book , which is the key to a one-@@ way street argument .
No , it is easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : how much time have you made to read it ?
Is it the case that the central thesis of the press is wrong ?
I have not read and will not read it .
I am therefore relying on the summary of his central thesis , and that is what I think is pure nonsense .
The concept of gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Has mankind not generally enriched itself ?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ z@@ ai is an impressive figure and deserves the price undoubtedly .
But remember that it only has 17 years .
An age to which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world .
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the young gir@@ l and will find its way to a happy life .
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old ad@@ age that the perverse col@@ our@@ ings are the embo@@ di@@ ment of evil .
All my happiness in Mal@@ ala , but it must realise that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular areas of Britain !
Some@@ one thought that his speech was a little strange .
She than@@ ked her father for giving her a great deal of freedom but she mentioned that , if she were not there now , she would have been married to 14 years .
Is Mal@@ ala itself not part of these &apos; perverse col@@ ours &apos; ?
You should not have any &apos; anch@@ oring time &apos; on this site .
You , yourself , are a horri@@ ble perverse .
This is absolutely appalling .
No , his father was not going to mar@@ ry it at 14 years .
It was 15 years old when it was fired .
His father leads a school where girls are in school and he is in favour of equal rights for women .
It is , and has always been , to receive higher education and have the right to decide on its own marriage .
However , it is someone unusual in Pakistan , as he believes that women are equal to men .
What she said is that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 years , without having a say .
De@@ ar that she did not say so eloqu@@ ently for you .
This may seem contradictory , but perhaps it would say that , if his father had not given him freedom , she would have been married to 14 years .
Instead of the entry into season 4 , and especially by J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , who obviously has a little difficulty in finding his so@@ ap character in Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ tri@@ ich .
I have just looked at the two seas@@ ons that are quite different , but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror stories , one of the most successful .
A first fascin@@ ating episo@@ de .
The achievement is close to perfec@@ tion and J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange s@@ ong s@@ inging the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on Bo@@ ys is simply over@@ turning .
I have not yet looked at this new season ( which will be the last for me , without a beef beef ) .
In the case of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r S@@ tor@@ y , I would prefer to have a look at 13 episo@@ des of 3-@@ 4 months .
One thing , however , is that , apart from J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , it is , above all , the risks of the scenes and of the mountains that took me .
There has been an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans in A@@ H@@ S which makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of the a@@ eg@@ tisation of today &apos;s produc@@ tions .
It is a little bit out of a little bit of you to look ahead in advance for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting for quality .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but , as you say , there are many other things .
No , it is simply that , for me , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ( and above all her path and the way she uses it ) is really U@@ N pillars of the series outside the technical qualities .
I look very much at it .
Then I think that the number of words in writing is too much .
The season 3 was slightly below , in 2 that was too fragmented despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I see them not doing 10 seas@@ ons from American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r S@@ tor@@ y or will end up like 24 hours .
But everyone is doing what they want !
It is by what I say &apos; I will not look at any later &apos; that everyone is obliged to do the same !
I simply share my view , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , J@@ E thinks it will be fatal .
However , that is my opinion .
Let us talk less about tax increases , please - let us go instead in government spending .
No , let us increase spending .
Those who wanted to sab@@ otage spending failed .
A@@ chi@@ eving po@@ le@@ m@@ ics about relatively small items of expenditure , such as development aid .
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than about the change of direction that the voters seem to be calling for and during all that time some people in each camp pretend that these nu@@ ances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters are clear in their game and find bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of expenditure .
The &apos; debt &apos; is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country .
The &apos; debt &apos; is nothing to worry about .
I would not see any problem with the government coming up to a third of my income ( even before talking about consumer taxes ) if I thought it was going to use it properly .
But that is not the case , and many taxpayers have the same feeling .
It is said that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development aid , Hi@@ gh Sa@@ pe@@ ed 2 , the subsidies to wind tur@@ b@@ ines and nuclear power stations that cost twice as much as they should , you arrive at a figure that makes the tax of Labour and L@@ ind@@ -@@ De@@ m quite ridiculous .
Your first GBP 10 000 is not tax@@ able .
This means that someone earning GBP 35 000 a year will pay around GBP 5 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone with GBP 50 000 worth around GBP 10 000 ( one fifth ) , and someone with GBP 200 000 is paying around GBP 70 000 ( just over a third ) .
And social contributions ?
The more social contributions , the more local taxes , the higher par@@ king costs and the car stic@@ ker , and it is before VAT .
Almost 30 % of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car stic@@ ker .
I am paid in a decent way , but not in an extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant way .
No , of course , I am happy to pay my taxes .
But let us not pretend that the money is coming from the sky , or that it is not important to know where billions of p@@ ounds are going .
How can an unemployed person who seeks work ?
Even though 20 % of the unemployed would not seek , that means that 80 % are seeking and are not .
As someone who is unemployed , I have more interest in the others seeking or not ?
That a potential recru@@ itor receives 10 or 20 C@@ V .
Indeed , I have not had any news from Po@@ le Employment for months , that is to say that agents are more busy with controls than really getting back from job announ@@ cements ?
I do not see the interest .
Because it is not up to the state to provide work .
If Po@@ le Employment does not provide enough jobs , then we must move from Po@@ le Employment .
What is a sensitive issue ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case we are ensuring that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights .
Just as a supervis@@ or asks for their transport title to users of a mode of transport , a head of service or the employees of their work , etc .
Nobody is sh@@ ou@@ ting the scandal in these cases .
It is indeed worth rec@@ alling that the unemployed have rights : the only two times when I had a case at Po@@ le Employment , my rights in the European Radical Alliance had been poorly established , and on one of the dossiers , which was cut by 40 % , it took a firm battle .
It takes time !
I am not an expert .
Fi@@ gh@@ ting and monitoring is taking place at the moment , while the ruling P@@ le Employment is close to being an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees , it is they who are paying the h@@ it@@ ches .
Non-@@ wage policies and policies are granted rights that they do not actually have !
That is not normal .
I would add that dignified unemployment insurance is involved in the recovery of labour work .
More than waiting for murde@@ rers in Arab@@ ic ...
In fact , we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria , which will stop I@@ sis , so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would then look like the spread of the black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with the war and movement of people at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is had the spirit of banning H@@ ad@@ j in M@@ ec@@ ca this year to the Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms from the three countries affected .
El P@@ ese reports that 7 400 have seen their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or their recent journeys .
In fact , there was the case of a pil@@ gri@@ m from Bosnia who contr@@ acted the M@@ ec@@ ca vari@@ ant during the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m from Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same mind .
Is it not a matter of heart to propose that the su@@ ffe@@ rers of E@@ bol@@ a be prevented from taking an aeroplan@@ e for Europe ?
I thought it was simply common sense but apparently those &apos; who know &apos; decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people ...
These West African countries in which E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be put into quar@@ ant@@ ine .
No one is going .
Only health personnel can enter .
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can go .
If they enter the E@@ bol@@ a virus while they are there , they stay there until they are guerrill@@ as .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Last week alone , people were infected after having had contact with people in West Africa despite having taken &apos; all the necessary precautions &apos; .
This disease can be stopped .
It is spreading mainly from the airlines .
Let us stop them from flying to these countries .
Furthermore , customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of E@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be put into quar@@ ant@@ ine immediately .
Let us get the message from the first person and the group ( including religious ) second , and he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt that he will be able to erec@@ t the image of God with the total cor@@ tex of the world in operation .
It is still a long way from that .
It is only 20 years since the information became known as the bon@@ us of humanity , whereas religion , which is derived from the circle , is running our actions since Lu@@ can@@ e .
What is the point of becoming yet another Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who have not noticed , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely a minority in France today , no one is forced to join .
Those who criticise would not put their feet on the Church anyway , but only the small number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France .
What is the next step , we remove the concept of sin , too much &apos; anxiety &apos; ?
L@@ or@@ ry the church is not limited to France .
And in the world , it can be that way to get more world ...
@ Mart@@ ine E , to be honest ( as usual ) respect for others as you see it predicted to be at risk .
H@@ ill@@ el a century before he said : &apos; do not do others what you do not want to be done , that is the whole Tor@@ ah and the rest is just a comment : it is going and studying ! &apos;
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity , but introduces the ag@@ ap@@ t .
Your &apos; advancing justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity &apos; but without any go@@ d ?
It is a return to communism :
The first step is to remove the embo@@ di@@ ment and resur@@ rec@@ tion .
Je@@ sus will remain the her@@ o who has changed moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be prepared to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and bring about justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity .
Not a Catholic ?
I believe that the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France is mainly due to the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and then converted to immigration a few centuries ago .
I hesitate to buy that , the new A@@ link , or W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 game .
And the new E@@ lic@@ te game is soon to come .
That is not the case .
Personally I would choose So@@ M .
I like W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 ( I even took part in his campaign to raise funds ) , but I do not think it is worth GBP 30 .
If it is the P@@ C version that is of interest to you , Gre@@ en M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is now selling S@@ M to GBP 30 and is also proposing a 20 % reduction .
Gre@@ en M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is now selling S@@ M to GBP 30 and is also proposing a good 20 % reduction .
I am going to look .
Obviously not at work .
The ra@@ ils of the computer department are blocking all sites .
Good morning , is it GBP 30 and then 20 % reduction , or does the £ 30 include the 20 % reduction ?
Let us be careful , however : the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
It took me surprise , I bought it , but I cannot do it .
In addition , I bought it on Ste@@ am , so no re@@ payment is zero .
It is time to buy a new video card , which makes the cu@@ t-@@ off of it .
It is a Brazilian site , but you have a valid Ste@@ am identifying , I believe .
This is an acc@@ ess@@ ory and all that : I did not use it myself .
Ama@@ z@@ on GBP 30 for P@@ C , GBP 35 for X@@ bo@@ x 3@@ 60 and P@@ S@@ 3 , 44 £ 44 for X@@ bol@@ x and P@@ S@@ 4
Thank you , I would be afraid that one day they will remove it from your libr@@ ary if they decide to take action against the people who buy it when they are outside the planned region .
Re@@ ally the be@@ et@@ a of E@@ li@@ te : D@@ ang@@ er@@ us .
For example , was France in 19@@ 40 a &apos; pu@@ ri@@ ad breeding ground &apos; ?
So , then , this Nobel Prize was a pois@@ oned present .
France must be helped by 40 : &apos; strange defeat &apos; ?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for L@@ iter@@ ature , you are wondering whether P@@ rou@@ st or D@@ os@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
The Nobel lau@@ reate is not even an event , but one does not even want to read the original authors .
Brazili@@ ans , Chinese or Austr@@ ali@@ ans will read Mo@@ di@@ ano , who is already difficult to read in French , and who describes a uni@@ verse that is so limited and so eg@@ regi@@ ous ?
I hope that the others are more credible , but frankly I doubt .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , M@@ ous@@ o only has a distant report with literature .
Have you read at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
That would be better to judge .
As for the Chinese , Brazili@@ ans and others , do not worry for them .
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture .
They will appreciate that .
If they do not know the value of Mo@@ di@@ ano , if they do not know .
For your part , you continue to attend L@@ ev@@ y and Mus@@ o .
I agree with you .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ m Mus@@ s@@ o retain their chances .
So let us see who obtained the Nobel Prize for literature .
P@@ ut in 2005 .
S@@ top them .
Since I have led one in Iceland , I will stop seeing K@@ ia S@@ por@@ k everywhere .
I believe that this has been followed up so far .
Perhaps she wants to cr@@ ush me ?
Or can I go along with the dreadful computer in Su@@ per@@ man III ?
Good day Dan@@ tr@@ a , always hatred ?
Good day Q@@ Q - not , not today , I have taken my medicines .
It is on Wednesday !
I had a few rest days .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the celebration of beer and the ci@@ der of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was a sub@@ standard .
I have managed to disgu@@ ise 19 different bi@@ ds , W@@ ob@@ b@@ y We@@ sa@@ l being one of my fav@@ our@@ ite .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mix@@ ture of people there , there was not only the fana@@ tical fana@@ tics ( not to be confused with the cam@@ era &apos;s fana@@ tics ) .
C@@ utting back on Sunday was really hard .
On Monday evening we went to the grand@@ father of a po@@ t to play the n@@ ard .
Thanks to a real chance of beginning , I have been able to go back with a number of people .
I hope that if I reach 95 years I will be as strong as he is .
Yesterday evening I went to a Car@@ k co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my be@@ ver@@ ages has arrived with a le@@ g of l@@ ens .
I ad@@ mire Mr President
Lis@@ ten a little Budd@@ ha and you will understand how wrong you are , Mr Christian .
Having said that , without wishing to upset you , I believe that you are moving away from the subject .
This famous whole , it bans the qu@@ e@@ ues for ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts from the mo@@ squ@@ es .
It immediately points out arms trafficking .
Either we have a great deal of eyes , such as Med@@ de@@ b and Tai@@ w@@ anese or Bou@@ b@@ ak@@ u .
We have to choose .
It is not by keeping the eyes of the eyes closed .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , dear Christian , but once again you are making a monu@@ mental nonsense : all the authorities , organisations or associations , whether Muslim or not , having formally condemned the I@@ As and its crimes , French , Muslim or not , have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions .
That is not a word .
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims , Arabs or Africans .
Not as French .
Unfortunately , dear Ko@@ ven@@ ch Mer@@ v@@ el , there is a doubt for everyone .
As I said a thousand times , there are doubts about the approval by the Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be fool@@ ish and in@@ decent to blame them and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong .
This principle is , in my view , the neg@@ ation of the Republic and can only help to un@@ lock French society .
There is no doubt , as I say .
Who does not say a word , but let us agree ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations with I@@ As or the condemnation of I@@ As .
The silence is very practical , it is the main weapon of those who want to put the go@@ at and the k@@ nees .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but pragmatic .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , in the elections , &apos; reven@@ ge &apos; from the parties represented in West@@ min@@ ster , because a huge gap has increased between their proposals for decentr@@ alization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence .
Cameron must be pe@@ tri@@ fied to the idea of losing all these seats in West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must be lau@@ ded .
What are these threats ?
The Conservatives are completely searching for Scotland because they have no basis .
They can do what they want with electoral impunity .
I do not think that even Cameron is fool@@ ish enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in West@@ min@@ ster for the benefit of the S@@ N@@ P is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives .
Who is going to pay a weapon for the Labour Party .
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the S@@ N@@ P and UK@@ IP , which will cut their heads in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ band joined the &apos; P@@ RO@@ M@@ ES@@ SE &apos; thought he was res@@ cu@@ ing his party but without realising that he signed the death judgment of his Scottish MPs .
No wonder some Labour MEPs are asking their leader to account .
If the S@@ N@@ P gains 20@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives , then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentr@@ alization .
I think that is what is important .
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected one day in England .
Se@@ tting up the 8 % p@@ um@@ ps to the detriment of 85 % is not a sup@@ er electoral strategy .
Moreover , once Scottish MEPs can no longer vote on matters relating to England , the Conservatives will win all the votes .
O@@ h , I think it is .
Cameron may not have much to lose , but M@@ ili@@ band .
Mag@@ gi@@ a did so with the Ul@@ ster Uni@@ onists and it was successful .
Yet he is still in a position to be Prime Minister in 2015 and he has won the Labour Party leadership .
So , in essence , these bo@@ xes will be virtually behind every read@@ er to look over his shoulders and see what he says , how he reads , and to the end .
It is &apos; life of the others &apos; of East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B applied to the world of the F@@ R@@ I@@ C ...
Still the same fasc@@ ination for monitoring techniques .
In the long term , this will at least have a ster@@ ili@@ zing effect .
I await the next ticket : Ama@@ z@@ on produces V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E according to V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E , and automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of its secrecy !
It is a world .
For@@ give .
Thank you for the article .
As under this system , the management of the D@@ R@@ M@@ s is not im@@ pl@@ anted , it remains a reading of pir@@ ate files , of the public domain books or purchased from a few publ@@ ish@@ ers who have the intelligence to offer files without m@@ our@@ ning .
Given the price I have paid the K@@ ob@@ o , it is without regret .
I am amazed at the widespread ab@@ dic@@ ation of users in the face of widespread ownership of their privacy .
You will always notice that everyone is giving a fi@@ de@@ lity card ( f@@ one , S@@ ti@@ n ) and ... ) .
There are also demanding ma@@ ster@@ pieces whose openness and completion rates are undoubtedly der@@ is@@ ory .
For example , &apos; Fin@@ ne@@ g@@ ans W@@ ak@@ e &apos; James Jo@@ y@@ ce .
@ Thomas : In the era of Bi@@ g D@@ ata , the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant .
Let us be careful not to put all the literature in the same b@@ reath .
The gathering of an@@ onymous data when there is a profile ...
The harvest is not an@@ onymous .
It is the data published by K@@ ob@@ o , which is not allowed to identify read@@ ers or authors .
But K@@ ob@@ o has all this information .
There have been so many exaggerated , false and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government over the last few days that the country seems to be led by a class of nur@@ ser@@ y nur@@ ser@@ y .
This is even worse if you take account of Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism .
It is interesting that some of Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s supporters believe that Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment , but not my own .
Of course - and this is the case - Turkey does not want to sho@@ ot itself up , unless it gains something .
If it attacks I@@ SIS , I@@ SIS will be ri@@ fe , then it is actually sho@@ oting itself .
A pension diplom@@ at written on his blo@@ g : &apos; The A@@ P reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be wrong to seek to over@@ throw Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad because that would endanger Israel &apos;s security .
It is not clear in the article if Iran sent a serious warning of re@@ pris@@ als or merely advised caution .
This second option is more likely and , in any case , what is really surprising is that today Iran &apos;s and the US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria , Israel and the security of the region .
The reading of Indi@@ an P@@ un@@ h@@ ine is to be strongly recommended to anyone who looks at the details rather than in the case of the traditional media in the traditional media , and the short article that you provide is important and should be read with the realistic and realistic remarks made from Iran to Afghanistan in 1979 - 1980 .
Who are the &apos; moder@@ ates &apos; who seriously combat the dreadful secular Assad and , at the same time , the perverse I@@ SIS ?
The pipeline policy is pushing the world into the ab@@ ys@@ s , and I would suggest to those who refer to the existing &apos; moder@@ ates &apos; to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War .
&apos;@@ That is even worse than that if you take account of Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism &apos; , are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?
I have one in mind .
There should be a N@@ u@@ rem@@ berg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks .
What should be done ?
You realise that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being still alive ?
A little late , my po@@ t ...
Are criminals not just old now , like 120 years ?
A little late , not ?
Particularly with regard to the C@@ U@@ P tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate , which planned and led the genocide , T@@ al@@ at@@ at and D@@ j@@ em@@ a@@ al , killed just after the 1@@ st World War on reven@@ ge by the Armen@@ ians , and En@@ ver killed by the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks in a p@@ acked place in Central Asia at the same time , when he went there and dre@@ aming of a Turkish empire .
What is the point !
An impressive ma@@ ster@@ y of the fall@@ acy of fatal sl@@ op@@ es , but apart from that , we are trying to make contact with the real .
Let there be no argument .
The fo@@ et@@ us will always hear a heart that is even fighting in the selling of a wearing mother .
les@@ bian couples can simply be a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted .
Un@@ il@@ ateral couples too .
As for children !
It is a shame that they should be regarded as future psychological dis@@ cor@@ d .
One day they will have the age to defend themselves , to say that they are happy to live , earn a living and pay for the retirement of this lad@@ y .
The G@@ PA is undoubtedly a temporary &apos; solution &apos; in the evolution of medicine in our world .
It is not a date .
Many women have brought and put children who were not from their hus@@ band .
That is what we are doing .
The important thing here is that this practice should be controlled so that the &apos; commerci@@ alisation &apos; of the body is limited .
But cosmetic sur@@ ger@@ y , cosmetics are not too commerci@@ alised .

It is certainly more e@@ leg@@ ant to get a good way of getting a good country off the ground via the Internet and Pa@@ y P@@ al than to shoulder its responsibilities and to avoid the scandal in another centuries close to home , without sh@@ utting it at that time on all the ro@@ of@@ s !
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church !
It is not only Christians and beli@@ ever@@ s who reject these practices ...
However , the exploitation of bodies is a real problem .

I do not know why there are so many cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous comments here about what Paul M@@ son says , perhaps they are being asked by people who have never been co@@ ol@@ ers , even for a few years !
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the so@@ cc@@ er which is awaiting your comments .
This is very true .
Since the film of Tony Par@@ son , there has been a shortage of reporting that really reflects the reality of North England &apos;s culture .
It is no wonder that Paul Ma@@ son has gras@@ ped the social and political context , he understands things .
The North Su@@ ther@@ n still lives , but it has been v@@ am@@ ph@@ ed by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface .
Having said that , you can make an ear if you are in the London region in November : 9@@ 9@@ p@@ l will once again move from sou@@ l vin@@ ey@@ les , including full from Nor@@ ther@@ n Su@@ l , on Saturday 15 November to the B@@ et@@ se@@ y Tro@@ t@@ wood in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .

Business is becoming increasingly pois@@ on@@ ous .
The Palestinian people have no peace partner .
Unfortunately , Netanyahu never has an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace .
@ J@@ on@@ a@@ than : Netanyahu does not seek peace , since he wants to continue to occupy a colon@@ ization ( incidentally , it was also the case of R@@ ab@@ in ) .
It is obvious that R@@ ab@@ in , Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred the settlement of the settlements to peace .
He took his clo@@ thes , the post on ro@@ ck and entered water .
An Israeli had stolen them .
The Israeli representative is going to anger and vote : &apos; What are you talking about ?
The Israelis were not even there !
The Palestinian representative ( UN ) s@@ miles and added : and now that things are clearly established clearly .
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bi@@ polar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower the guard ...
It is obvious that this is not the aim of the anti-@@ Israelis .
An@@ tic@@ on@@ ist : However , I have answered you : the world geopolitical report ...
This has always happened since the policy is globalised ...
E@@ vi@@ dently , avoided ...
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , for the creation of the Palestinian state , that is certain , it is going on !
For the creation of Israel you do not answer .
What strength of strength has the creation of Israel lost ?
An@@ tic@@ on@@ ist : the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force of strength today !
You have no doubt !
In addition , it is not just about Rus@@ sell Br@@ and , but journalists in the Guar@@ dian seem to have difficulty going beyond anything that he does not have to say .
A lot of what he says is nothing but p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ pe@@ y@@ ists written in writing .
This shows that you do not understand what Rus@@ sell Br@@ and said , or what No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky says .
It is just a continuation of personal attacks and ins@@ in@@ uations ( my 13@@ -@@ year-old daughter likes it well , which means that it is a question of im@@ maturity ) .
A truly vicious burden , with just a suspicion that Rus@@ sell Br@@ and says some tru@@ ths , perhaps tru@@ ths that we prefer not to think about .
Please take it , this feeling will become increasingly widespread !
I can understand why B@@ h@@ ent horri@@ fied some : he sometimes speaks in a pre@@ ten@@ tious way and after all the nonsense of the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id , he does indeed give the impression that he is an early populist , but the whole story of not voting was completely mis@@ interpreted in my view .
The general consensus seems to be that it is right for people not to vote and instead to take a stand and to ignore the entire political process - but if you look at Pa@@ x@@ man &apos;s interview with other articles and vide@@ os he has put forward , he says that to vote once every five years for Labour or the Conservatives ( or Li@@ b D@@ ays I pre@@ sume ) and limit the democratic commitment to that is completely unnecessary , the two parties ( to slightly different degrees ) , which are essentially in favour
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with her solution ( because I believe that being politically active by presenting his requests may go hand in hand with voting , given that politicians will change their minds if they really are at risk of losing the elections ) , but it is a pity to see all the con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding responses that say that this im@@ min@@ ence that makes Je@@ sus says to the young people not to take the trouble to vote .
The solution is extremely questionable , and it would be good if people were to debate what he actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people who are left behind .
Yes , thank you .
The vote on the vote was completely distorted .
I am deeply anno@@ yed by the fact that it is not useful to sli@@ p a bul@@ le@@ tin in a ballot every five years , since my vote really does not count for anything .
I want more referendums , electronic voting , direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters .
Moreover , I challenge the idea that the words of Rus@@ sell Br@@ and are not the people ( written by others ) .
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas , even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thin@@ kers and anti-@@ establishment aca@@ demics from the counter-@@ culture that Su@@ z@@ an@@ n would like to grou@@ ped together under the label &apos; p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ pe@@ sts &apos; .
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne .
Perhaps that is what the Guar@@ dian could do , that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne would do as Pol@@ ly To@@ y@@ n@@ be@@ e and interview Rus@@ sell on a v@@ ér@@ anda , with even the co@@ ver@@ t ho@@ sts of the mon@@ k !
Like Ma@@ x K@@ e@@ er , who at the start attacked Rus@@ s@@ sel , but ended up becoming one of his f@@ ans and inviting him to do it , it is all too easy to attack it without really understanding where he wants to come .
He is pun@@ ishing in a political speech that has existed for generations , but which has been marginalised by the traditional media - including the Guar@@ dian - for generations .
In my view , this &apos; fron@@ t@@ line &apos; shows , above all , that the intellectual debate has been held for a long time in history in history , where histor@@ ians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of the con@@ den@@ sed type of Science P@@ o .
For my part , I had seen the intellectual attitude of Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ u as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need to blame a cul@@ pri@@ t , a scapego@@ at .
They are developing one and the other of the very rational thinking , but this ration@@ ality is based on those scapego@@ ats that are the cornerstone of their thinking .
I believe that for F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ut the State was indispensable as a cul@@ pri@@ t .
This is a very ar@@ cha@@ ic thought , the thought being sacrificed , which is also the magic thought .
The problem is solved in the report by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ ical , neo-@@ li@@ b and / or / liber@@ tarian sl@@ ope ( two words mark a tightening of the desire to eradicate the state , the first knowledge of which is to seek state aid for its markets ) in the sense of the less state / not of any state in F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult .
The old dream of the basis that is self-@@ organised .
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state : without this guilt it is not standing up .
He says that he is guilty of disposal , murder and sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
Neither support .
The totalitarian left will remember the right old time , that of the go@@ d of then , Stalin , the small father of the people .
O@@ ul@@ ala , you may have read a ch@@ un@@ k too quickly if you took the F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult texts on the Iranian revolution for K@@ home@@ ini &apos;s apo@@ logy .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ te would no longer be am@@ using to attack Michel in this way ...
Mr G@@ au@@ chet raises a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective , on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether or not we agree with him is an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
It is quite ridiculous to see that cab@@ al or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by researchers in the human sciences of the hard left who do not bear the br@@ unt of the al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ a .
The nar@@ co@@ tics and the author@@ itarianism of these people are unlimited .
One important point to add seems to me to be the position of these &apos; rebels &apos; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of the Chinese and other &apos; j@@ ail@@ s &apos; that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You have not had the pleasure of hearing our Austr@@ ali@@ an friends on this subject .
And where was it in Russia , that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I do not remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time .
In London , they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia , in the 1990s last time , in a market .
The Chinese think of white white .
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou a long time ago , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them who have spoken viol@@ ently anti-@@ Bush .
My father is not happy that his el@@ dest daughter , together with a B@@ lan@@ c .
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and , above all , in recent years : they are increasingly rich , prosperity spre@@ ads outside the large cities , and thanks to that prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live .
From what I have been told , the Russians have , above all , prejudices against temporary workers without qualification from the Caucasus and Central Asia , who work in professions and in areas where they have a great chance of being exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence .
Although I have lived on the shores of the River I@@ en@@ is@@ se@@ i in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
Unfortunately , I have heard the views of the Austr@@ ali@@ ans on the Chinese and the Ab@@ ori@@ genes .
It is really bizarre that a foreign@@ er tells me that I do not support the Chinese , when I met two in my life ( one abroad ) , did not keep a bad memories , all people are worth it and , in fact , those in London were very nice that I remembered that they were Chinese .
Otherwise we do not remember who is meeting , all people are worth , how to remember who was who was .
You know what is bizarre ?
Whether you and the Russian other are talking about the Chinese as a kind of single fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attr@@ action in a zo@@ o .
Yet you always get out of it .
How many Chinese men are with B@@ lan@@ ches in comparison ?
No , because there is a great deal of chance that the parents of these B@@ loc@@ ks will be able to take the initiative .
No measure of fairness in justice .
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that is still being manipul@@ ated by strong groups on the left , such as the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate union ...
It is a question of the exception , but the legal circles are quite frankly right .
When the courts of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate only submit 25 % of the judges .
If a measure of its bias can be made from the rela@@ tivity of the enforcement of laws in the courts , it comm@@ its two obstacles .
W@@ ho@@ ever takes the political view of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the judge .
Then it remains the law enforcement tool to re@@ focus the assessment on the fundamentals .
The measure of its in@@ observe in all the judicial acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , including the public prosecutor , must make a distinction between the error and the partiality of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates .
It would be pointless to claim that justice is not divided between these three groups .
There is no objective analysis and lack of knowledge .
So if all this is not analysed , how then can we say that justice is improving in France ?
If it is only by statistics that implic@@ itly it is a little bit lower .
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio .
The corruption of the judiciary .
A@@ side from the sensitive nu@@ is@@ ance of the nu@@ is@@ ance that is given to the judicial institution capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The area considered is the issue of the issue of the so-called &apos; third-@@ party &apos; segreg@@ ation of inher@@ it@@ ance , which has been committed until such time as there is sc@@ ams in the case of the procedure for the procedure .
This profession gets a good EUR 150 million worth of EUR 150 million while benefiting from the covered coverage of the qu@@ asi@@ -@@ legal impunity of the French volunte@@ er .
For the understanding of their mechanism , part was reported in the comments following the first publication .
Where this is in line with the so-called statistical improvement , which is to be found , in the previous comment , it is that the judicial institution has produced , in many disputes between gener@@ alis@@ ist and reluctant inher@@ it@@ ance , a whole series of legal cases contrary to all the laws that are favourable to he@@ irs .
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria not a form of lies ?
Un@@ doub@@ tedly prohibi@@ tive prices .
There is still material to be used for the disabled .
You can say that , but my bro@@ ther has one of these tri@@ cycles , built on a measure of size and weight , and it has really enabled him to enjoy the full air as never a normal whe@@ el@@ chair , with whe@@ eled whe@@ el@@ chair and ty@@ res .
As we say , g@@ ates and col@@ ours ...
T@@ anz@@ ch@@ ai@@ ri resemb@@ les what Je@@ re@@ my C@@ lar@@ k@@ son could invent for a challenge in To@@ p Ge@@ ar .
T@@ ot@@ ch@@ air looks like E@@ P@@ I@@ Q@@ EU .
I think that the inven@@ tor of the W@@ h@@ ill has never had to clean up a c@@ lic@@ k of dog .
I am sure that my s@@ ister would love the whole area , but it is simply too expensive .
The long-@@ distance whe@@ el@@ chair will be perfect for a disabled person with a pen@@ sion@@ er .
Here there are h@@ ills .
P@@ ric@@ es seem to be high , but there are really people who put such prices in a bic@@ ycle , so &apos; you see &apos; .
I think it is particularly useful .
Not all disabled people are poor .
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available .
Only if they have become disabled .
The bottom line is that the whe@@ el@@ chair market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford to practise high prices for things that they know full well .
We cannot really say that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
This is an example of excessive des@@ ks .
Unfortunately , it is just a draft , it is not intended to make it .
I am CO@@ N@@ IT@@ T that the long-@@ distance whe@@ el@@ chair is not on the market , because apparently there is no way to drive this tru@@ th@@ ful fi@@ g .

C@@ ou@@ ch@@ over@@ g is much more co@@ ol than Airbus .
This is the very definition of the economy of sharing , with no profit .
Many are only looking for a night at C@@ ou@@ ch@@ over@@ g .
So it is to be paid ( or at least hope ) in another way .
It is always much cheaper than a ho@@ tel , if the right addresses are to be sought .
Furthermore , owners and ten@@ ants often stop using Air@@ b@@ n@@ b and treat them directly in cash , thereby by@@ passing Airbus .
Where is the community in all that .
&apos;@@ What does it mean ? &apos;
No problem with the saying , what is the problem with your g@@ ram@@ mar ?
We do not use the words &apos; to l@@ et &apos; in the United States .
The author simply used an American expression .
It is an international newspaper now , if you have not noticed .
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat , ensure that it is 100 % in line with all safety rules and ask those who manage can@@ als and rivers to carry out a commercial activity - what they will certainly refuse to do - and I have a boat and I have tried to find out how to praise it ( in all honesty ) on Airbus , in short , it is really a nightmare ...

Re@@ al and populist action
In fact , we do not know too much what Mari@@ e Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see that ?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I am not sure that S@@ pe@@ e really &apos; refused &apos; to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed safe from the exact strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ sia in his book &apos; C@@ ast@@ le of Ste@@ el &apos; suggests that S@@ pe@@ e quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cu@@ ff@@ é in the area .
The sea was heated at the beginning of the day ; I do not know whether it was still at the end of the battle ?
Similarly , the fight ended after the sun , making any rescue operation more difficult .
Comp@@ are that with the following battle , that of the Mal@@ ou@@ ines , where , on the photo@@ graph@@ s showing the survi@@ v@@ ors of being res@@ cu@@ ed , we see a calm and open sea .
Moreover , the sa@@ vi@@ ors knew that there were no more German combat@@ ants at this stage .
H@@ um@@ m , that does not really correspond to what I remember to read on this battle , so I did a quick research on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a :
&apos;@@ There was some confusion among German vessels about the fate of the two cu@@ ri@@ fied cr@@ us@@ ers , who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped the sho@@ oting , and a k@@ id pursuit .
The L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g is living in the fire , but coming closer to it is that it was only a wrec@@ k .
The N@@ ü@@ r@@ berg , slower than the other German ships , joined the late battle and lives in Mon@@ mouth , which was thought and seriously damaged but still on the move .
After pointing out its spot@@ light on the flag of the ship , the proposal to go to the ship was refused and open the fire , ultimately sin@@ king the ship .
Without reliable information , von S@@ pe@@ e judged that the Go@@ d H@@ ope had to escape and stop research at 10.@@ 15 .
There are reports of a British cu@@ ff@@ é in the vic@@ inity , he went to the north .
So , if that is true , the Germans , in the dar@@ k@@ ness before the ra@@ d@@ ar invention , did not know that a ship had sun@@ k , and therefore could not seek survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also thought that there was a more important k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y in the area that could have damaged them seriously , so in the confusion they disgu@@ ise to take advantage of their advance .
They were far from their base and S@@ pe@@ e was well aware that they should go down a path through many of the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y vessels .
The sacrifice of C@@ rac@@ do@@ k had already caused them to damage them , and had caused them around half of their muni@@ tions , thereby condemning them when they were finally taken .
There are a number of voices in the U@@ M@@ P calling for it to be enshrined in the law that a definitively convicted elected representative is therefore permanently in@@ eligible .
That is a courageous position , which would also affect elected representatives of the left .

When is the ban on trade unions in sectors already protected ?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens ?
In@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed by politicians , whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , always quick to am@@ pli@@ fy those very people who will benefit from their in@@ am@@ ity in order to hinder the actions of real policies , which are really trying to get things moving , not the fine words of which the im@@ mobility is so much as sufficient .
I met them in the me@@ tr@@ o at mid@@ day with their small plac@@ ards &apos; under the heading of justice &apos; they came from province and did not make the difference between Ber@@ c@@ y and P@@ O@@ P@@ B .
It supports the existence of political unions , whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party .
It would not defend the same arguments if right-wing , or even right-wing , trade unions were the target of person@@ alities on their side and led to a judicial and media war .
Your statements are completely free .
If , at the moment , the right dec@@ la@@ res the current court of law , it is simply that it has committed facts .
We do not have an example of a left-wing person who had so much to do with justice but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated in favour .
On the other hand , it should be remembered that the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate union on the left is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and that it is a minority .
Let a minister support the trade unions with so much commitment .
The trade union that you mention is perhaps a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but its influence is great to the Chancellor , it is not a secret .
We are now wondering whether the &apos; mission &apos; of certain judges is not more s@@ ali@@ ent rather than being educated .
You should be satisfied , the S@@ M is a minority .
What are you complaining about ?
This is not the case : you forget that the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates are not officials like others : they are the only ones who have the power to charge and to inc@@ ar@@ c@@ ate everyone .

Good day , K@@ ati@@ m W@@ iss@@ el .
I believe that even the most g@@ lim@@ mer of gl@@ ory is aware that X@@ -@@ F@@ ac@@ tor can only mean the end of a career , so I would be surprised if someone could accept their offer .
Many have used it as a spr@@ ing@@ board to start a successful career .
The O@@ ne Direc@@ torate fill stad@@ i@@ ums throughout the world .
Others then sold a lot of dis@@ cs or went to W@@ est En@@ d .

Even A@@ B@@ B@@ A , O@@ li@@ via New@@ t@@ on-@@ John , C@@ é@@ li@@ ne Di@@ on , C@@ li@@ ff Richard , all made the Euro@@ vision contest , like so many others .

The end of a career
In fact , it is more likely to lead to a career than the typical process of ro@@ ck , even though in your dreams you think that all fo@@ am f@@ ills that smoke from grass in the gar@@ age of their father and swee@@ p three agreements on a po@@ em at primary school will surely become st@@ ars , and that the only question is how much they want to touch even before it comes out of an al@@ bul@@ m .
And worse than lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous : it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples - a distance that comes relatively quickly to racism , because sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t eth@@ no@@ log@@ ists present us with these distant people as infin@@ itely super@@ sti@@ sti@@ ous and pe@@ tty of rit@@ ual bi@@ go@@ try , when most of their ways of doing so are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired , like ours , by practical considerations .
If you look im@@ prud@@ ently in the opposite direction .
Well , but rather than saying that the bu@@ mp@@ y is not sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t , is it not better to admit that our Mari@@ ann@@ e and our olig@@ arch@@ s are not a little sac@@ red ?
It is as though we were reminded of the sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t as a kind of well-@@ defined objective and contained in the religious sphere .
It is very interesting .
It is d@@ ec@@ o ep@@ em@@ em@@ e to m@@ our@@ n the vacuum .

Your contempt for ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists is completely unjustified !
It is thanks to them that trea@@ sures are constantly being discovered , that there are valuable testi@@ monies to rebuild history , to understand societies , and the example here of comparative ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology is exciting .

A great deal .
In view of the am@@ ate@@ ur images , the lack of an image makes it possible , above all , for I@@ IA to avoid troub@@ les@@ ome issues of the kind : how is it that the Commissioner ag@@ it@@ ated a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident ( see the full video after the accident )
No , it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the I@@ IA is blocking the images of the accident , but because one of the Commissioners is clearly seen as a green flag , a sign that the race can normally resume and that we are more under a y@@ el@@ low flag .
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F@@ 1 .
Yes , it is expensive , the race is no longer under a y@@ el@@ low flag , the place of the accident , and hence the green flag .
That is the usual procedure .
The post of comm@@ is@@ er@@ aries just down@@ stream of the accident ( depending on the case , it may be 10@@ m as well as 10@@ 0@@ me@@ ters after the accident ) ag@@ it@@ ated the green to tell the pil@@ ots to take a normal line .
sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism is selling the pu@@ b .

It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism .
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frigh@@ tened and an@@ gu@@ ish ( without getting the hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to get us off when it needs it .
I think it is perfectly logical that , if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency without any attack , why not have an E@@ bol@@ a crisis without any proven case ?
It seems that this government is seeking to save us from crises that it himself has invented .

It is completely unnecessary .
As always when we talk about science .
Not only does the testi@@ mony serve no purpose : it cannot be used as a scientific material .
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts .
It is not a scientific material .
Perhaps that is why it is not possible to put questions to patients in psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry when reliable observations are made from the close .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric dossier mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t is explain that I have been educated tele@@ pa@@ th@@ ically by her mother .
This is therefore an objective symp@@ tom .
When I say that it is the head@@ line , it is a subjec@@ tive subjec@@ tive testi@@ mony .

For Muslims , Mo@@ ham@@ med has been in parad@@ ise from this ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it is M@@ ori@@ ah , where A@@ bra@@ ham is failing to sacrifice his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
From the moment it was taken and cont@@ ex@@ tual , there is no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also has its extremists , it is good to remind them of it regularly , and they are unfortunately reported to the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i Ben@@ net , A@@ vi@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Netanyahu , the latter accepted the plan to 2 states , and has s@@ ounded it up . )
It is also good to show how the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact .
Will God be able to recognise the people ?
The shor@@ test Jewish jo@@ ke : &apos; God is praised ! &apos;
In order to bo@@ ast of tourism in Israel , we are often told by the half-@@ hear@@ ted na@@ ï@@ ve , al@@ an@@ gu@@ ies on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usual , quite different from what advertising shows , as we can see from the picture that illustrates the article .
It is a little afraid .
And this picture is a splendid piece of propaganda !
It is a pity that the photo@@ grap@@ her of Re@@ u@@ ters has not taken into photo@@ grap@@ h the hundreds of Palestinian people who are allowed to r@@ ally on the M@@ oun@@ t M@@ oun@@ t and who prefer to go down the Jewish faithful in contra@@ vention , pra@@ ying to the wall .
If this picture bo@@ thers you , it is right , it is not the newspaper , the photo@@ grap@@ her , but this woman and the ideology she trans@@ poses to us .
This system is not tenable and will end up .
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution .
Since the economy seems to be running out , large companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages , while at the same time , and without hiding , they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the summit .
You are right , that is not tenable , but it will change in that country only when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of r@@ inging and ma@@ m@@ ming when someone else does the strike , support them , show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems , but also about your employer , that you will not get people un@@ punished .
Unless democracy is abandoned , in which case , if it is tenable .
I fully agree .
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
Like China and India , for example .
All this cannot be done well .
It is because we are in democracy that it has been .
Did you vote for the T@@ T@@ IP ?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ I ) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism for investors and states ( IS@@ D@@ S ) proposed by the agreement serves .
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the un@@ imagin@@ able damage that this agreement will have on our lives .
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about it in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ di@@ an World Development is therefore the answer and you will understand what is being negotiated in your backs .
Did Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill not say &apos; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &apos; ?
This is an excellent effect , when digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
This gentle@@ man is right , in the X@@ V@@ III there were trade unions in all the reg@@ im@@ positions of all .
In the highly Catholic French army , there is a dimension sacrificed .
Le@@ a@@ ve it ( finally , its officers , the others , no one knows anything ) believe the co@@ ff@@ er of France &apos;s e@@ ternal values , and it will fight and close its ste@@ am .
Then , with the decline of the country , globalisation , Europe , the crisis of values , in short : the dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this small link , is comfor@@ ting .
Even though it is increasingly un@@ comfortable ...
They still lack the s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot of married men , c@@ ali@@ aries , married women , c@@ ali@@ aries , lost dogs , and I do not know what yet I do not know what yet .
If you do not write the French correctly , I am trade union .
You are warned , it will be your fault .
In order to defend the categor@@ ical interests we already have enough of the protected professions with trade unions , which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens .
We are asked not to lau@@ gh about the fear of a civil serv@@ ant .
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees freedom of expression without trade unions , or even without a right to strike as in Germany , in return for the protection they enjoy .
Otherwise , there is no disaster .
And with the char@@ ts that are preparing , the government welcomes it .
What security are you talking about ?
Indeed ...
I was referring to the military and other officials , because this is the subject that has been mentioned here ...
Let us think &apos; through its delegates &apos; in Article 8 of the preamble to the 19@@ 46 constitution .
It will become &apos; 8 .
Every worker is involved in the collective determination of working conditions and business management .
This is absolutely essential with the erup@@ tion of information .
And yet you have opened , probably read and then commented on a specific article entitled &apos; The Great British B@@ ak@@ e O@@ ff &apos; ?
Look , the section was there .
I thought that the convers@@ ation was needed .
In any case , it is the marriage of J@@ off@@ rey that I have looked at , and I can tell you that some have been well informed .
In the J@@ off@@ rey marriage episo@@ de one of the best moments ( though misleading : it was wine ) in the history of television .
So , of the late m@@ esh ...
G@@ ame of Th@@ ron@@ es !
I love G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
This is the second time in which it is strange that the emissions end with a victory for the least worst b@@ ak@@ er ; no one has done a &apos; mu@@ m &apos; , that is my ca@@ ke .
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has ultimately had an effect on them ?
In previous weeks , all these external people were kept separate .
And there is also the idea of &apos; playing security , there is always next week &apos; , which is disappearing last week .
I love to co@@ ok , but I do not think I am doing that .
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a sup@@ er enter@@ tainment and make us try to try and try and try to get things right .
B@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree , the last challenge last year , the marriage ca@@ ke , was absurd .
Prof@@ es@@ sional professionals usually have days to do so , and they have to b@@ ail it out in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three challenges were really difficult to share , I do not know how they were able to choose a winner .
In the case of Lu@@ is , the only real defec@@ t they could find was a rather dry basis ( although I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that the green ice on the m@@ ill of Richard was not en@@ vy , in any case Richard had already lost at that time ) .
I have to say that several challenges in this series seem to be somewhat artificial because of the time allotted .
There is also cancer , with solar wind .
Clearly , we are all successful at the moment .
It is a bad moment to go to humanity .
You are confusing solar and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys .
The U@@ V is blocked mainly by the ozone layer , which is shaped precisely by the impact of resid@@ ual solar and V@@ V particul@@ ates .
So even if the mag@@ netic field weakened , there would not be enough solar wind to &apos; hun@@ t &apos; the ozone of the str@@ at@@ o@@ sphere .
There would even be more , and therefore less U@@ V and &apos; cancer &apos; .
Fortunately , the ozone layer does not block the U@@ V .
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect .
If we restrict ourselves to man , they have the interest of allowing us to have os ( a syn@@ thesis of vitam@@ in D ) , to heat us ( less than the rub@@ b@@ ish ) , to mod@@ ul@@ ate our immune system and , it seems , to improve our mor@@ ale .
The ozone layer is blocking carcino@@ gen@@ s and leaving the U@@ V@@ A and most of the U@@ V@@ s .
You know that you are not obliged to be pat@@ ron@@ ising and to look at your interlocu@@ tor as a stay when you make a comment ?
Above all , for a minor clarification which was implied in the comment , which itself is intended to be ped@@ ago@@ gical .
Not to say that I am an accustomed to mel@@ ancho@@ m , the U@@ V only makes it a C@@ ED@@ E@@ L@@ R .
They do not have the P@@ RO@@ V@@ O@@ N@@ T .
As proof of this , all the b@@ ron@@ ised people do not necessarily have mel@@ tings .
Either , when a tu@@ bi tells you that we must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a ca@@ ve , it is better not to listen because the U@@ V is necessary for every human being .
Ex@@ tr@@ action , however , is like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
U@@ V causes mel@@ ancho@@ m directly .
Is it possible ?
And , more importantly , can we get it through ?
or to move on to a joint venture ...
I believe that the majority of those concerned have established that everything can be done if there is sufficient force and the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 is perfectly acceptable , for the use to which it is intended .
I believe that the army would need something more resili@@ ent and has not yet adopted the I@@ P@@ hon@@ 6 as a communication material .
But for us ?
That is a good choice .
The majority of those who are interested have established that everything can be done if there is sufficient force to apply sufficient force there .
Sa@@ ve a No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
More specifically , is it already in place ?
This is a jo@@ ke in every discussion .
I have decided to count them .
This is the fourth jo@@ ke on the te@@ eth that I read in the comments today .
It is difficult to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before specific software is inst@@ alled , it is assumed that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain , and it is hard to see how it could return .
So , H@@ um@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The most likely thing is that it is a production unit on which the i@@ O@@ S has not been set up properly and is therefore stuck with the plant test code .
I do not know how they are doing this .
But would they put the test software on all ?
The photo@@ graph@@ s on E@@ bas@@ i clearly show the absence of C@@ C@@ C or EC lo@@ go and the presence of a proto@@ type red link .
That is an excellent article .
We want cheap products , and we are surprised that industri@@ alists produce in &apos; industri@@ alists &apos; , but all the teachers and m@@ asses of small trade are affected by a good b@@ reath , bi@@ o sav@@ a@@ c EUR 16@@ 50 .
But to answer your post , if it is possible to eat it correctly with a small pay .
After everyone is free to put their priorities where he sees fit .
For my part , food is one .
T@@ ry without ran@@ so@@ m ,
You call b@@ ob@@ s , or best b@@ ob@@ lo@@ lo@@ s , people who see the world through an ideological &apos; software &apos; that leads them to dis@@ connect from reality .
It is the total un@@ bund@@ ling .
They are expert experts , for example , claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a show@@ er .
It is also experts in a st@@ agg@@ er , joining the g@@ us@@ -@@ c@@ avi@@ ar , from which they sometimes come , for example , by condemning CO2 emissions while passing their holidays to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mix@@ ture of excessive and st@@ agg@@ ering ideology , as well as being surprised to meet with criticism of them .
Wa@@ h , thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive the@@ or@@ isation , and for all the associated details ( aeroplan@@ e , swe@@ et ... ) .
I would like to be one of them , but I do not find myself there .
The concept is not so complicated .
B@@ ob@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ s are mon@@ ob@@ ous .
You have understood the concept of g@@ au@@ -@@ c@@ avi@@ ar ?
Well , you are able to understand the concept of b@@ ob@@ lo@@ l@@ o .
It is a perfect copy with just an ideological nu@@ ance .
The classification would be more complicated if we were to take an interest in the eco@@ lo@@ s .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ lo@@ l@@ o is a part of that , but it represents only the most visible section of the eco@@ lo@@ s , because it is the one that inf@@ uses the media .
That is a fine sla@@ m .
Ap@@ parently , no one wants to look at it .
It is so badly made that it looks like a female n@@ u .
You are next to the pl@@ ate .
We must be part of the art of art to understand the st@@ agg@@ ering beau@@ ty of the truth of this work .
But you simply do not have any legitimacy to comment , since you have not spent many decades studying and flat@@ tering large artists .
What is important is not the fact that E@@ mi@@ n does not know and seems to be obs@@ essed with the same subject .
What is important is that it has really managed to become a rich and famous person with no artistic capacity .
This is the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue of the Charter .
No , it is co@@ ch@@ y .
The fact that E@@ mit@@ n does not know how to draw up the drawing up of the plan to draw up the design of E@@ mi@@ n .
That is not really a proven fact .
It is rather an opinion .
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs that smoke by playing the fo@@ g .
Jud@@ ging art can be problematic , but not in that case .
It is much more than just representing the real .
If you are looking for that , a photo@@ grap@@ h will do the case .
The author also speaks of E@@ mi@@ n &apos;s ex@@ es@@ sion@@ ism .
Let us look again and let the image speak for itself , without compar@@ ing it with the kind of design you may prefer .
If that is so easy , why do you not ?
There is still a need to make savings : the activities of equi@@ ties , the number of do@@ ses of the Republican guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service ...
The truth is that France is reducing its staff , but as all countries have done , sometimes even more drastically , starting with Britain .
It is only half encouraging ...
Oper@@ ating without support , it quickly finds its limits !
A sing@@ ular approach , as we see the weaknesses , the shortcomings of our defence tool , particularly in the Sa@@ hel .
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned , which are losing a dimension of their activities , or even part of their history .
Where is the promised sanc@@ tu@@ ary ?
This is what I was saying , but look at where to make savings but , above all , not at home , that is really not possible .
That is exactly what you are proposing to do , to look at where there is a certain amount of waste .
Let all those who have come up with a little or no military thing dare to come here and say that there is no money wasted in this per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , and that is not going to bur@@ y .
Let us apply the same po@@ tion to the whole public function and public finances will go a little better .
And for Jo@@ i : look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why the defence can be given a bit of responsibility !
B@@ ine yes , the economies on which everyone agrees that they must be done , must be seen somewhere , not ?
It is a po@@ t of po@@ t , those on whom it falls to murder when it happens at home , the poor .
We should do this but , above all , it does not come above me because , in this case , it is a crime and not an economy .
Yes , it is going !
In what way will the V@@ al de Gra@@ that weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As far as local authorities are concerned , history is repeated at every closing post , maternity , hospital and bar@@ r@@ acks .
But everyone is in favour of savings of course .
This is bizarre , a may@@ or U@@ M@@ P who wants compensation and does not look forward to the savings made in public spending .
This article really is the most astonishing tru@@ c I have ever read !
This embarrassing moment in which the first three people make the same bad jo@@ ke .
It is the de@@ pressing to get rid of its Fac@@ e@@ book thre@@ ad and to see that 80 % of its friends began their stat@@ utes with the phrase &apos; embarrassing moment &apos; .
I believe they will make a film .
It will surely be based on ho@@ ly scenes where someone comes out by chance of his ex ante in the bus by going to work and is only going to see that his j@@ et has returned to his tr@@ ous@@ ers .
It is not embarrassing , it is completely clear .
Not really , in my opinion , the author is taking the role of the British man typical of whom we have always learned to bur@@ y his emotions and keep his te@@ eth .
I am sure that if you are a f@@ an of K@@ ate Bush , the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence has been a strong one .
You realise that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have rights ?
I do not have the Internet .
So I do not think I can comment .
Not having a computer .
My go@@ d , I have to make that film before I die !
I do not believe that this article is the most incredible tru@@ c I have ever read !
Char@@ lie has just demonstrated that he is at the top of the co@@ sm@@ ic uni@@ verse of sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I would like to turn to the reverse !
It is absolutely essential that I agree with all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter so that they finally have the ill@@ um@@ ination and discover the un@@ believ@@ able cre@@ ed and the insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us that j@@ ail@@ ed Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s cl@@ oud as a div@@ ine light .
Well , that was really no .
Above all , if it is not women , nor is it the case .
I am a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive development in democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective associations .
So far , we have been confisc@@ ating the right to save our planet by states that play the st@@ ars at every bul@@ l to save the planet .
We therefore decide , citizens , to take things in hand .
Together with the Commissioner that they have pl@@ anted energy , all these fine recommendations have been stolen ...
T@@ ry : E@@ oli@@ an and solar farms are the R@@ on@@ ds of tomorrow .
All that is financed by the con@@ tri@@ ved .
Please stop this pro-@@ nuclear speech .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
radio@@ activity is much more damaging to the level of its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not fully controlled , it is better to restrict itself to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is our only sal@@ vation , provided , of course , that our consumption is drastically reduced .
Is electricity from renewable to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is in no way concerned .
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and ep@@ sil@@ l@@ on for the other stages .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity by renewable wind or P@@ V is already more G@@ ES in other stages and , above all , gas , or worse coal as in Germany , to offset the inter@@ mit@@ tent .
R@@ emo@@ ving nuclear power by renewable wind or P@@ V would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Chris@@ tine , I am not insul@@ ting to you , I am a State State of State in the physical sciences 198@@ 1 , and I have carried out nuclear physi@@ cs research , and I challenge you to prove contrary to what I have said .
For what I did not say to you , I did not say anything about Germany , but you did not respond to what I was saying and like all the right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ishing the contact I never do .
I would also mention the conclusion of experts man@@ dated by the German Government : the current renewable energy programme is an un@@ profitable and ineffective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and should be stopped .
If you do not count on the extraction of uranium and the construction , and if you do not count on the ste@@ am of greenhouse gases with less effect than Co@@ 2 , it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is in ste@@ am water and a little in rivers .
I stopped reading when you spoke about Pakistan as a &apos; giant of South Asia &apos; !
Last time , Pakistan won against H@@ im@@ stan .
I am not surprised , most Indi@@ ans who make comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan .
In fact , that shows your mind@@ set .
It would have been such if they had described the giant India of South Asia ...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved , but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply be opening a full P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box of corruption and ma@@ fia .
As for the I@@ SL , the opening match of today has been surprisingly interesting , the A@@ le@@ ti@@ co de K@@ ol@@ ata , which is imposing 3@@ -@@ 0 against M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
In comparison with the billions and billions that India de@@ votes to the P@@ LA cr@@ ic@@ ket and now football , how can we ever compete with our &apos; no@@ is@@ y neighbours &apos; ...
The race for the low co@@ o@@ king is paid out .
It is a shame for such a fine project .
In the case of the incident , the possible lack of design can only be seen with too cold a h@@ eli@@ um .
So perhaps it is not a design defec@@ t , but implementation ...
Unlike ari@@ an@@ space that is a private company , it seems that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as it is , it is its own insu@@ rer .
They will be able to pay the satell@@ it@@ e-@@ based satell@@ ites that know .
This is all the more anno@@ ying because many media are hiding the headlines of articles , and many read@@ ers only retain these securities .
All this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself .
I fully agree with you that the title is not appropriate , it is un@@ ju@@ stly calling into question the project , whereas it is only a problem of lan@@ e .
