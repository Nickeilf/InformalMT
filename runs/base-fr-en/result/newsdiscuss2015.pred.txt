UK@@ IP , who reject those who are living with HIV , are a perfect example .
You are talking about when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism , and when , with this in mind , it responds yes when the inter@@ viewing asks specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirable .
First of all , you use speci@@ ous arguments and then dis@@ credit them with barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Wh@@ enever I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we have to qu@@ e@@ ue behind the intoler@@ ant hypo@@ cr@@ ites who think that all is due .
I think you are using speci@@ ous arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the right-wing divide , does not exist practically .
I believe that this is what is called democracy .
No one would be affected by UK@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
It is only in the parallel uni@@ verse of UK@@ IP that Car@@ sw@@ ell can appear as a revolutionary .
A quot@@ ation from a tor@@ ch is proof of this .
Yes , therefore , take the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail did not write the report , it did just comment on it .
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for propag@@ ating such populist propaganda as if it were reality .
I do not think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You know nothing about my personal situation or identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
The Far@@ age sentence was a great surprise , but only because we rarely talk about this problem .
He has made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic remark .
You will have to get you back .
I am not of course where you want to come , but I imagine you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like .
This is so rare because , unlike Far@@ age and his divided follow@@ ers of That@@ cher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of God , not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are something good , not .
Ultimately , the situation is as ro@@ tten in Ireland as in Spain .
With the new crisis in the austerity period , nothing will be done .
To see almost 5 % growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
In Ireland , we were told that the T@@ B@@ R@@ E , the EURO@@ P@@ E , has been bo@@ oming .
We have seen the follow-up !
This has been suggested .
There is an attempt to make the impression that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that a N@@ U@@ U@@ V@@ U@@ U M@@ IR@@ AC@@ E M@@ IR@@ O@@ MI@@ EU is now taking place .
With the Brussels agreement , which is im@@ po@@ tent on the lowest social society in Europe , a flexible work march , an ongoing emi@@ gration .
This is not what the Poles have to say .
In the 1980 ’ s of the twentieth si@@ ec@@ le , the ir@@ relevance of one of the poorest countries of the Euro@@ pa Union , with the Portuguese in view of a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without the inf@@ ants , is always better than it was .
The Gre@@ y was ahead .
The fact that their development is not a long peace river is due to the recent dis@@ closures .
Europe &apos;s lowest im@@ po@@ ts ?
That is not true !
Latvia has an im@@ po@@ t rate of 0 % on companies .
Now there is hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the im@@ po@@ ts paid by the multinationals .
According to a report in 2008 or 2009 , they pay less than 5 % in France .
Only small and medium-sized enterprises are paying their own .
Now I can confirm that the road tra@@ il has become en@@ demic , and there are new cars ( and che@@ re ) all of the street , just as before the 2008 crisis .
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years , the recovery is evident in the daily sheep since the entry .
Is it supposed to be economic news ?
Do not worry , I am sure that the comments will soon get bo@@ gged down .
In another article that they are writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ ha@@ l A@@ str@@ a is involved in a c@@ up on A@@ 140 .
Does R@@ y@@ an@@ air now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way ?
I believe that Mr O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft , so a few bo@@ oms and ra@@ ids on the old will soon be forgotten .
Having said that , I am voting with him next week , so I hope that it will not be on one of these people once they have been reduced .
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot .
Did R@@ y@@ an@@ air pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that they were willing to provide ?
But without this kind of Irish business you could not afford to go on holiday , young man .
I never took R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the last three times I took the plane was with B@@ A .
I prefer the airline to propose a good service .
No , but it is R@@ y@@ an@@ air , so they can be very happy .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air trigg@@ ers dozens of comments from people who would never take R@@ y@@ an@@ air to those who like to take R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay something other than the basic tariff have only to take on themselves , etc .
That is quite transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air is not going to be happy with the additional costs of this incident .
I wonder what the delays will be and whether we will have to compensate passengers and , if so , whether R@@ y@@ an@@ air will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers in the airport .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers have been placed in another plane in less than an hour , they have no right to compensation .
It is a long time to dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to British Air@@ ways , which takes the English SIS in Syria , not as you say .
Good Tra@@ vel
Last Sunday in Paris , the street of the Frank@@ s@@ s@@ is , the Mar@@ sh is a large part of the world , and is literally a group of people .
People do not come into a mass for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( most of them ) or for the magaz@@ ine Sal@@ on in the B@@ lan@@ c@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ es area ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly d@@ ust ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the shops are all open and that the area is incredibly lively and lively .
With many foreigners who spend ...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs ?
G@@ o to Paris R@@ ue of the Fran@@ co Bour@@ ge@@ is , where the shops are opened the Sunday world , with 50 % of tourists .
This !
The only argument that seems to me to be admissible is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they are buying a tax .
The tourist areas lose a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment , exploited on the Sunday , can lower prices .
D@@ omin@@ ical rest is a right which , except exceptions , benefits employees .
That is why it is planned and regulated by the labour code .
Neither the Minister for the Econom@@ y , nor , indeed , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , has any competence to reform the labour code .
Now they are closing it .
The law serves what ?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses that want to work on the Sunday .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al on Sunday I take my small children to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my City of 30@@ ,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal bi@@ o is open four days a week but not the w@@ e !
That is access to culture ...
It is also the regulation of working time .

And if the succession of his daughter was , against her will , used to pay for the costs of succession ?
There are pain@@ ts .
Some are good , others are not terrible .
No doubt his succession would like his share of the ca@@ ke , if you do .
His preference for a victory for nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its F@@ as@@ c@@ ist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
Nor will it .
But for five years , and only for five years , it has been perfect .
In 19@@ 40 , he led the other ar@@ ts of the government who wanted to discuss an “ agreement ” with the Naz@@ is and was very sk@@ il@@ fully won .
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy , he united the country in the idea that combating fasc@@ ists was the only way to win .
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom , France , and Belgium and , ultimately , the whole world , can thank God for having had over these five years , just over the five years , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the hel@@ m and no other .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
That its des@@ c@@ endants sell pain@@ ts on the free market to collect money from inher@@ it@@ ance costs , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to be able to ad@@ mire one in a mus@@ e@@ um , collect money to buy it .
It is as simple as that .
But we could use tax money .
No one can deny that , when it was “ the moment of truth , ” Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill ’ s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A revival of the internal market through public works will only help large companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by avoiding hi@@ ring , with the infrastructure shipyards by definition not renewable .
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister , they clearly reflect the real evil :
Let us return to the pr@@ inc@@ es .
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory .
That the weakest of us is not in need !
Either we support it , either , it has D@@ R@@ ILO in exchange for the services it makes or has made to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H , which I prefer to s@@ mile corresponds to this vision .
There is also the donor who lives on income from his property .
It is necessary to differenti@@ ate the person who in@@ ve@@ sts for a return when he reti@@ res and who lives from his rents .
A good thing to praise , or two for a couple , is vice versa .
The little gen@@ i@@ us of finance is sing@@ ul@@ arly lacking in imagination .
The new deal was a policy of major work , but at a time of great infrastructure defici@@ ency .
Today , in Europe and France , this is not the case .
Develop@@ ed countries are su@@ ffe@@ rers .
The need for infrastructure is marginal , thus in no way a new deal could be a solution .
Especially at a time when the issue of growth is emerging in response to a recession , which is only a brutal sav@@ age de@@ growth , thus brutal de@@ growth .
You would have been right 30 years ago : the more need ( or possibilities ) of dam@@ s , coal mines , motorways ...
But if we want to make the future climate shock worse , then the need for investment is cr@@ ying : isolation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transport and energy storage , etc .
A tax that favours high incomes and r@@ allies .
Who is in power ?
O@@ ut of the s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies .
Charles Ar@@ th@@ ur is really a gal@@ op@@ in .
The benefits of Sam@@ sun@@ g are damaged by the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and its competitors in the same range .
The introduction in mid-@@ September of greater scre@@ en control for i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and 6 Pl@@ us may have attracted bu@@ yers who would otherwise have bought a Gal@@ ax@@ y Gal@@ ax@@ y .
I have tested all of these tele@@ phones and decided for L@@ G@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a customer , but not in favour of Ap@@ ple .
I think we need an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft put this philosophy in place , we had a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google , Ap@@ ple , and the community op@@ en .
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development .
In addition , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
I am inclined to buy Ap@@ ple because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design .
Some people do not attach value to design , for them the options , func@@ tionality and the price .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let us stop looking for &apos; a better platform &apos; .
There is &apos; a better car manufacturer &apos; , not really , they are different but similar .
I would like to see a flour@@ ishing port@@ able industry with radically different approaches to different people and markets .
This is healthier and must be encouraged .
That is in our interest .
I am pleased that you have found exactly what you are seeking and that it is not a Ap@@ ple product , even though I have made a different choice .
Most people I know have i@@ Ph@@ hon@@ es .
Our U@@ p@@ per friends who , according to one of them , are fighting ideas and not men ( on the contrary , well on Dutch b@@ ob@@ go@@ s ) could tell us what ( the author ) is , if they fight gender ideas and tell us what works they rightly intend to combat .
Or are they just about the kind described in the Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te or Val@@ ue A@@ re@@ as ?
Their sources are Ju@@ dic@@ th Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I like you well , and you are an intelligent and cul@@ tured person .
I said this on Ju@@ ith in the F@@ ur@@ us@@ to ve@@ in about Hol@@ ph@@ er@@ ne , which did not come to me ( I do not have his v@@ ag@@ acity ) .
Otherwise , in the &apos; substance &apos; , as you refer to it , this subject is not of interest to me , and I really do not see where the problem is : I had hoped that you and your friends could get out of my back@@ lo@@ g because I am slow , but I fully understand ...
@ Jean : recognise that , cul@@ turally , return Jud@@ ith to Hol@@ ph@@ er@@ ne is doing so .
Who is afraid ?
But what is fear of those who are afraid ?
F@@ ur@@ as@@ to and @ us give us some answers .
The first by invo@@ king the Bi@@ ble of the Bi@@ ble , the second by describing Ju@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler as a very symbolic c@@ at of g@@ or@@ ge .
We can see how in@@ tim@@ ate these studies are at home .
We are , of course , no longer in the debate on the idea .
This is much more profound .
Do you read , Jean , that the Mon@@ de has published an article on the need for the@@ ology ?
@ . With regard to a debate of ideas , I thought it was appropriate to go to sources .
It seems to me not to be very rigorous to claim to be able to combat ideas from the mere statement made by their critics ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ atz@@ inger , inven@@ tor of the Gen@@ e of Gen@@ e or X , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ en ) .
But it is good , as I explained to our friend , U@@ p@@ per , that is the difference between having an enligh@@ tened opinion and a simple opinion .
I am not on the other side of the argument .
I did not read Ju@@ ith , the very symbolic g@@ or@@ ge of g@@ or@@ ge , I was content with the &apos; Second sex &apos; ( which was more of my time ) , which I believe is the source of &apos; source &apos; according to the wishes of L@@ o .
As I watched the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se since M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , I saw red lights when the mo@@ on was briefly shown when the cl@@ ou@@ ds opened up .
This sudden appearance of the red l@@ one had its char@@ m and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by cl@@ ou@@ ds .
This was wonderful here in F@@ N@@ Q .
Yes , last night ’ s cl@@ oud would truly en@@ vy the Co@@ ca@@ tor@@ ia and N@@ S@@ W coast , while most of the rest of Australia had clear time .

But if Labour accepts our unfair budget , we will make it its colour as soon as possible .
Do you not ?
I was in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne then , of course , I saw only cl@@ ou@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne has also been able to cover himself throughout the week of the Per@@ sian me@@ te@@ or@@ ic rain and almost all the astr@@ on@@ om@@ ical phenomena of recent years .
I am beginning to think that there is a bad gen@@ i@@ us whose sole aim is to prevent the inhabitants of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything from the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an observatory , even if things are greatly improved on the other side of the Cor@@ di@@ l@@ ère .
There were periods of 10@@ -@@ 20 minutes where I could not see the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se because of the cl@@ ou@@ ds above the sub@@ ur@@ bs of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
I am going to put a TA@@ X@@ E on this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se .
Q@@ U@@ I@@ K@@ ON@@ EU is looking at this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se .
I be@@ t that your first thought of the day is for Ab@@ bot@@ t , just like the last one before you go .
Who or what will you get when it ends ( necessarily ) by disappeared ?
It seems that you have a long time to read the discussions by seeking messages in which people criticise the Ab@@ bot@@ t government and then accuse them of being obs@@ essed .

There is nothing about stock market and property speculation .

The next time .
O@@ k , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ...
As far as the management of its budget is concerned , the state ’ s time horizon is not comparable to households , because the time horizon of the state is theore@@ tically infin@@ ite , while that of the household is restricted by the life of its members .
Moreover , unless we consider that public spending is un@@ productive , these contribute to financing material and int@@ an@@ gible investments in the growth of tomorrow and thus in future revenue .
A few points of response .
A regrettable decision .
But remember the Hi@@ p@@ po@@ cratic s@@ ister : the health of the global pharmaceutical companies ’ profits must be safeguarded above all .
The p@@ lot theory of p@@ lot .
Unfortunately , the truth is not your fant@@ asy .
Med@@ ical staff would like to use it , but they have the hands of the law as written by the policies .
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions rather than having risky sur@@ gical interventions , safe ho@@ ho@@ ot rooms for drug addic@@ ts rather than having them on the streets , etc .
On these issues , politicians want to please the indic@@ ted m@@ asses .
In fact , doctors do not earn money with medicines .
That is why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors do not earn money with medicines as Liberals want our health system to resemb@@ le that of the United States , you should find out how it works .
Every@@ where in the world doctors are treated in the same way , but it is more or less visible .
It was perhaps wrong to put the blame on the people , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to business profits and research .
So read the few reports on our spending on P@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ its Sch@@ em@@ e and the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ing global prices of medicines everywhere , as well as differences between one country and another on the free sale or only on prescri@@ ption .
This is strengthening a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific process , direct or indirect .
In fact , some companies are currently carrying out tests on mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ ations against on@@ co@@ logical pain , in spite of the laws that hinder them and the costly permits needed .
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as mari@@ ju@@ ana are used , those who reach a version offering good quality products to known do@@ ses will benefit widely .
As you said , but you are wrong , a lot is happening behind the scenes for doctors and pharm@@ acies .
As for this hospital , they were happy to use it until someone put the chi@@ p on the ear of a person who was in this hospital .

If “ researchers ” in social science were research instead of politics and net@@ working , they could be used to use their “ work . ”
An investigation resear@@ cher does not compare one fact with another .
It is not the intention .
Com@@ par@@ ing it is making research not research .
We cannot say ‘ research ’ has to be applied , and then in the same way ‘ we have to experiment with everything ’ .
If your research is successful , why can we experiment ?
If your research is not successful , why are you asking for them to be applied ?
Can I explain how a “ resear@@ cher ” can inf@@ er that a student who cannot equ@@ ate mathema@@ tics alone could as@@ simil@@ ate mathema@@ tics and other matters more easily ?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that pupils learn to use new technologies , but how will they be able to learn new technologies if they cannot learn ?
The gun tests are just an indicator , which is an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us .
What is the point of building an indicator that in@@ forms you of what suits you , a desire for self-@@ promotion , a dec@@ eption ?
One way to train teachers is to move away from the training of S@@ hel@@ ts and ideolo@@ gues and to practi@@ tioners teaching practi@@ tioners .
This re@@ read the paragraph on the tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hi@@ ps ( which , alas , is not very good ) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conser@@ va@@ tism : ‘ It is a mechanism that primarily leads to the reproduction of existing practices , and that does not allow the system to be moved forward ’ .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , it is not possible for practi@@ tioners to teach practi@@ tioners , even if they have their place in modern training of teachers teacher teachers .
Education the@@ or@@ ists must have no place .
The practi@@ tioners must have one .
Would you want to be operated by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and which has never set up the foot in an operating bloc before ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system .
To give more weight to education the@@ or@@ ists is to destroy it definitively .
Your analo@@ gy is completely cra@@ zy : if I do not want to be operated by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has only theoretical training , then I would like to have a sur@@ ge@@ on with a sur@@ ge@@ on that has no theoretical training and has learned on the t@@ ack .

Thank you .
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright , I will have to read an article like this .
In an information economy , the violation of copyright is stolen .
This is the same thing as they must quote their sources correctly .
Often , obtaining a licence costs nothing .
No , it is a violation of copyright .
Not the same thing .
By using content without having the right licence , you deprive the artists of their livelihood .
You can always debate ped@@ an@@ tic assumptions - but it is flight .
And you can repeat it as much as you like , but that will not be true .
This is a violation of copyright .
G@@ o again .
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright law .
Clearly , it does not b@@ other you to deprive artists of their income .
If they think they should be given money for images used in school duties , an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use , then I am happy to deprive them of this shadow income .
I@@ te@@ m 1 should be to show how , if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their fav@@ our@@ ite social networks , they abandon all intellectual property at the site under the general conditions they have passed from a c@@ lic@@ k .

If we could export this resource , which we are full of , the r@@ ash that says that everything is going badly ...

I have two children and when they are about to choose , I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then .
France is pul@@ ling people down by constantly assisting them .
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created .
What is pul@@ ling France down is speeches like yours .
I have always worked in private enterprise .
I had the C@@ H@@ A@@ N@@ CE working in companies run by excellent business leaders : that exists in France , but it is rare .
I am paid because I know that I do not have the competence to lead a company and that choice allows me to sho@@ ot off the nu@@ ts that I frequently encounter .
In my bas@@ ke@@ t@@ les , I fully agree with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : he says the horrific truth !
If you compare with German companies that French business leaders are constantly calling for reforms in France , the companies in Germany have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive , particularly by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French bos@@ ses waiting for ?
Let the state keep them ?
Is this state which they are accused of ?
@ Jacques L@@ .
That is the same b@@ reath that you have taken up .
Rem@@ ember , what have you created as jobs , as added value , to be as severe ?
I understand your reaction .
In fact , France is facing an in@@ trac@@ table problem : the in@@ competence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are bu@@ o@@ king and sha@@ ming while waiting for the permanent state assist@@ ant !
That is terrible !
But they have solutions : abolishing the Lab@@ or Code , employers ’ burdens , taxes , working 4@@ 5@@ th / week paid 35 , and some , wal@@ king on eggs , dare to demand lower wages , if not elimination !
I look forward to all the &apos; negative &apos; comments on this subject .
What is ironic about the way people are always complaining about F@@ ir@@ st Group .
As I see it , L@@ as@@ t has not really been an investment for us taxpayers .
They have tried to stay af@@ lo@@ at rather than transform .
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since L@@ as@@ t is concerned .
But they have also improved with their predecessors , including British R@@ ail .
Unfortunately , we do not have the power to do that , unfortunately .
I tried to have them recently , but I did not succeed .
But it is good that Labour is going to get bo@@ gged down .
It is an international subsidiary .
They already operate trains in Germany .
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in ten@@ ders .
But it seems that we are not very good in management , most of our priv@@ ati@@ sed services end up being managed by a foreign operator .
I still remember the scandal and criticism when F@@ ir@@ st won the Vir@@ g@@ in contract , so that the decision was finally cancelled .
And there is better : M@@ T@@ R , a Hong Kong company has won the railway contract of the Cro@@ at for 8 years .
Well , the Labour L@@ ower , as they told us during the referendum campaign , is totally in favour of po@@ oling and sharing and believes that workers must all help themselves across borders .
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision .
It is perhaps because Dutch management is on good track when the British are not .
What S@@ co@@ t@@ R@@ ail needs is not just a change of ownership but , above all , new ideas .
A@@ bel@@ li@@ o may be the least bad choice , but the real problem is the ridiculous system of crossing , not the cross .
&apos;@@ He was a bat@@ tered gir@@ l &apos; .
I was in favour , but I really had such an expression .
As@@ sum@@ ing that being &apos; bat@@ ting &apos; is a higher quality than many others , the concern of others , intelligence and listening , for example , to being &apos; bat@@ ting &apos; has nothing to do with that of survi@@ ving a disease : &apos; bat@@ tered canc@@ ers &apos; , which are no less dead , I know of them .
It has nothing to do with merit .
G@@ o and start again .
I say to you that it is a condition for adminis@@ tering , I say to you .
Nothing has any merit ...
When you look at your life , you can judge them .
I repeat .
It is quite simply mon@@ str@@ ous that we should not be able to get away from a disease , if only for a moment .
The body follows or does not follow .
A body that cowar@@ dly , everywhere , despite the will , despite the confidence in medicine , has a vague idea of what it is .
N@@ a@@ ve to think otherwise , if there is no doubt that having a solid mor@@ ale makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it , to seek experimental treatments like this one , and not to refuse them out of fear .
Some@@ one who is in medicine is primarily someone who tru@@ sts medicine .
But if you prefer to get back to the &apos; l@@ ord &apos; is something else .
Neither with deserved credit nor with courage .
These considerations are specific to the mor@@ alists .
When you catch a sal@@ t , a true , you are d@@ wind@@ ling to the point of becoming just a z@@ om@@ bi@@ e .
Personally , I have caught two , sal@@ v@@ ines , big , and if I have been &apos; beaten &apos; as they say these psycho@@ log@@ ists have completely escap@@ ed me .
Unless this fight is merely to s@@ cra@@ p the te@@ eth , to suffer the hell and to bur@@ n the b@@ lows .
I believed that the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised a decade ago .
I have not seen this name in the newspapers since at least that time .
What is happening ?
It is an anniversary .
A forgotten anniversary .
His trial was conducted &apos; quickly &apos; and then swept away under the car@@ pet .
Is this the story that we were told at the time ?
Is the Communist , who have unle@@ ashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade , that have unle@@ ashed three wars in the Balkans ?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
So please ask what was voluntarily left behind : 1 .
How could the NATO bombing be legal under L@@ A M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ E rule of international law ?
What country has Serbia attacked ?
On R@@ DR@@ s ( Rad@@ i@@ o-@@ Tele@@ vision Ser@@ bi@@ a ) , why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target ?
Milosevic had no way out : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , he would be cru@@ ci@@ fied as a tra@@ itor .
If he defended him , he would be sw@@ ay@@ ed by the Western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
The W@@ ester@@ ners used a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en to de@@ t@@ ach part of a sovereign state that subsequently declared independence and was pres@@ tly recognized by Western states that later li@@ ed to the ground on the ground .
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed .
Z@@ or@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time .
In the end , the Guar@@ dian should not describe Milosevic as a ty@@ rant ( even if we do not like ) .
As far as I am aware , there is only a method of predic@@ ting earthquakes in Greece , by measuring the peak levels in the Quartet .
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results .
So a hope , but caution has nothing to do with the H@@ A@@ T@@ -@@ P-@@ 1@@ 1@@ b ex@@ po@@ sures , located around 1@@ 24 years of the earth in the C@@ y@@ g@@ us con@@ st@@ ellation , which would be “ the smallest and the co@@ ol planet to present detec@@ table water m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules ” , according to a study conducted by the D@@ rak@@ a D@@ ing and J@@ on@@ a@@ than F@@ ra@@ ine team of the University of Mar@@ y@@ land .
So let us follow it .
Just as those involving animals that pose a threat .
Thank you , Mr P@@ ass@@ er , for the fact that we often have the experience of these experimental achievements in the world .
How can animals be ( in advance ) ?
There is no doubt that the perception of other elements of the rate is changing .
Like ra@@ don , for example .
A pri@@ ori gas is an insult to man but perhaps dec@@ el@@ able by animals .
All these methods are in@@ trac@@ table for humans , but not for the measuring instruments at its disposal .
We do not have a reliable result on these paths …
It has repeatedly been observed ( and for centuries ) that some animals are acting in a strange way hours with an earthquake , particularly the h@@ ens , cows , dogs , but above all fish and s@@ wa@@ thes .
I had seen a re@@ treat from the struggle of two scientific teams , a Califor@@ n@@ ian , the other Japanese , to recognize the validity of their work that focused on the sensitivity of animals to land mag@@ netic fields , and in particular to their change before a sea .
Well , I am not a scienti@@ st , but their assumptions had convinced me !
Or is this research ?
Why so much contempt for this approach ?
We should learn to listen to nature ...
If we look at things cal@@ m@@ ly and rigorously , we are publishing it in a serious jour@@ nal , and no one mis@@ understands .
As soon as we talk about the ‘ signs ’ given by animals , we are faced with the same way : everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake was a red fish turned out bizarre in circles .
I do not understand why Bor@@ is would be a good leader for the Conservatives .
He has done too much as May@@ or of London .
When we listen to the L@@ BC programme we cannot help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he is always trying to dis@@ tract with a jo@@ ke .
It never responds directly to anything .
He also said that he was in agreement with Far@@ age , and then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari has asked him what .
He was unable to name one point .
He made so many promises to be elected as may@@ or and he did not have one .
It only underlines the extent to which the rest of the Conservative Party is only a ra@@ b@@ ble of mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ e .
Because it is popular .
Because it is fun@@ ny .
He has been in “ H@@ a@@ ve I ” .
Because it is a celebr@@ ity and people have been accused of ad@@ mitting the cele@@ bri@@ ties .
The Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him and the same applies to the rest of the country .
When ( and not if ) he takes the party ’ s leadership , the T@@ ories ’ popularity ratings will c@@ ede the ceiling .
Let God help us .
I am not so sure : people like the jo@@ kes , but do they not want their prime minister to be one of them ?
That is exactly what the Lon@@ don@@ ers said .
He should have brought his friend to his friend , the smar@@ ter he was .
In many respects , I believe that he is trying to copy R B@@ ran@@ son .
The Americans have had one as President .
The French were truly and always dis@@ interested in the history of the Pacific War .
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books ( there is one , including a French and excellent B@@ .

It is understandable that the Austr@@ ali@@ ans , who know ( one of their heavy cr@@ on@@ ies , Austr@@ ali@@ a , always have to be in the bottom since the battle in S@@ avo@@ o ) do not want to return .
Indeed , we have gone ahead with the i@@ l of S@@ avo@@ o in the &apos; Ir@@ on B@@ ot@@ to@@ m Round &apos; .
Even if the mission comes to an end .
It is the small .
But the ec@@ ol@@ o is a total en@@ m@@ ity .
Cal@@ cul@@ o the k@@ er@@ o@@ z@@ ene consum@@ es in order to achieve the objective entirely in the concept .

It is also true for the ec@@ ological message that some people criticise the impact of the investment .
The end justifies the means .

Good evening I think that the red bo@@ y that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this journey is sponsored by the UK region and the V@@ ille de Br@@ rest .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies in any way should not devote a pen@@ ny of our taxes to financing the dreams of a few very nice ad@@ ven@@ tures that are even nice - there !
Are there any players in the current Serbian training that is of Koso@@ van origin ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , once in the Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now in the Fe@@ er@@ b@@ ah@@ ç@@ e , are Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I do not know whether they are still in the team still in the team .
It is Bis@@ ev@@ a@@ c the defen@@ der of L@@ y@@ on , not B@@ aj@@ evo .
B@@ aj@@ ev@@ vic was a land@@ mark or before in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , with many teams in Greece , but I do not know where he is .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic is Mo@@ star in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and he played as an attack on the great team of Vel@@ rez who , under the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary of the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary S@@ ul@@ em@@ an Re@@ ba@@ c , ended twice in the Yugoslav League ( and also saw points like V@@ a@@ hi@@ d H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and the loyal equi@@ val@@ ess of Ar@@ s@@ è@@ ne W@@ eng@@ er , Bor@@ o Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c ) .
Well , thank you .
Of course I know H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c .
What has happened in K@@ ra@@ si@@ c ?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in the Ju@@ ve , he is in Turkey at the moment , but the last time he appeared on my ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en , he was linked to Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n .
I cannot help you here .
I know he lost his place when Con@@ te arrived , then he went to the F@@ en@@ er , and as much as I know he is not .
Perhaps he can do something else , perhaps in the Indian Su@@ per League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Con@@ s@@ is@@ tically , Albania is not afraid .
You should love Albania because you are neighbours .
The s@@ ong is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of real Albania today .
Ap@@ parently it was the flag of the Great Albania , which encomp@@ asses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
A bit of excessive nationalism , in fact .
Fortunately , there was not too much damage ( I know ) .
In fact , it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is known as the Great Albania , but of Albania pre-@@ 19@@ 13 , when the major European powers decided to give the country to neighbouring countries .
How can we have felt &apos; an explosion of joy &apos; by seeing two rounds collapse in the knowledge that women , men and women who are children are inside ?
How ?
What I am somewhat anno@@ ying in this &apos; testi@@ mony &apos; is that the only fact that , at least once , we have been able to rejo@@ ice spontane@@ ously to the horrific death of thousands of people , is a sign of a &apos; limit &apos; personality , all of which &apos; testi@@ monies &apos; should be taken with great care .
There is no doubt that at the moment of &apos; joy &apos; we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted .
We have just thought , for a moment , that , for once , Muslims have been able to make real and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic damage to the great evil S@@ at@@ an in his very heart .
A powerful q@@ q@@ ich .
This is a great deal .
It seems that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims r@@ ounded by their sense of humiliation .
With fil@@ m@@ med testi@@ monies in Palestine .
C@@ l@@ assi@@ que Sch@@ ad@@ en@@ fe@@ u@@ de .
There was some doubt .
The &apos; Christian / white / g@@ au@@ us &apos; West cannot measure the degree of che@@ ese , anger and hatred of mu@@ ster when it con@@ j@@ ures up the he@@ i@@ f@@ ty misery , the social and cultural under@@ development of today &apos;s Muslim Arab@@ -@@ Muslim world .
I am talking about the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not of Dub@@ ai .
The past s@@ len@@ der , which is certainly mag@@ ni@@ fied , is not a cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How can we get the Muslim world out of this di@@ abol@@ ical circle ?
T@@ ot@@ al in phase , 2 po@@ ison po@@ ols irrit@@ ate the Arab world : the bi@@ go@@ try of the power in power and fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common point , the freezing of thought and the expression ( soft or army ) of its critical expression .
Let us have understood that before , we must not put Muslims back .
That is the only way .
Has Ed@@ ward Pl@@ en@@ el read this article ?
I assume that this is true in many countries .
In Britain , however , the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark , we@@ t and de@@ pressing months affecting the well-being and mood of many people .
In addition , everyone falls ill .
seasonal pressure .
I am suffering myself .
When the light goes , it becomes hell for me and those like me .
A do@@ se of vitam@@ in D should help a little for mood and well-being .
The autumn is beautiful in Britain , with or without rain .
The campaign in particular is to be broken in the autumn .
Not as much as the green light of the summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die .
In Britain , if you are lucky , the summer comes at a weekend .
We have had a good summer this year , do not make your gr@@ in@@ ding gre@@ en@@ er .
Not everyone .
I rarely fall ill in winter .
But now I am reti@@ ring and I am not going to develop immunity for the spr@@ ings of the outside world , that may change , I suppose .
It is not about to die , it is just a step in a cycle ...
A mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous phase full of bo@@ gg@@ ling o@@ ders , with a fe@@ u@@ per@@ ity that culmin@@ ates in f@@ es@@ tivities like H@@ all@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , the risks of en@@ qu@@ iring and full of other wonderful words .
Let us not stop doing things !
Those are my recommendations for you .
Yes , these dark and grey months actually make me much happ@@ ier and more rela@@ xed .
For the fis@@ sion of children ’ s inc@@ rements , it is the amount paid by the state that comes mainly from dec@@ im@@ ation 8 to 10 .
But when it comes to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result , it is the dec@@ im@@ al 4 and 5 decisions that are affected ( medi@@ an income ) according to grap@@ h 2 .
The removal of half a share of the wid@@ ows , above all , is not dealt with at all in the article , or rather its impact is complete under assessment : EUR 2@@ 30@@ M is a jo@@ ke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is in@@ dol@@ ent .
And it is not prepared to get things right .
Well , we are not on the stra@@ w , certainly , but on the other hand .
For once the P@@ PS has a rather lef@@ t-@@ lean@@ ing policy , we will not cr@@ ush ...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20 % have to bear far more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let us continue to do so , and you will encourage this 20 % less to work or leave .
Well , I know it is not politically correct , but I say it anyway .
L@@ ong live Tro@@ ika and O@@ C@@ Is in the S@@ PS : they have understood everything .
You can see what you are looking at .
The proportion is still the same , here or in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population has 80 % of wealth .
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from am@@ assing as much as it can .
Beyond a certain amount of money , money is losing all its value .
And once the money has been exceeded , the money is no longer used to make money , that is to say , to make the most of it .
We are among the richest 20 % .
There is no doubt that the 20 % of households that work most ( and create wealth , part of which is logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts .
Or , if we have social housing , it will be a drop in the arm and a social minimum .
Fortunately , the ut@@ op@@ i@@ as of the heads of the h@@ at to the red k@@ h@@ mer have lived .
I have done two Airbus in Norway recently .
There is no problem .
In one of the two , we have had things that we would not have had in a 5@@ 0-@@ star ho@@ tel , and we did not have to come to the recei@@ pt or face any trace .
You only have to go to someone , to sle@@ ep there , to go back and go and go back .
Now that will be my first option when I travel .
The lo@@ go has changed , people ...
Please take your assurance before you praise your house .
In most cases you will need a kind of ownership insurance .
Will you use a service with the right lo@@ go !
A@@ h , 6@@ th too late .
I love Airbus .
‘ It is very dangerous and highly risky ’ , it is not true .
You just missed the chance .
According to the link in the article :
To its discharge , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to T@@ em@@ an was quick , almost absurd .
In the 24 hours , after an e-mail supplied to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b sent a ro@@ ri@@ er to change the r@@ acks , made provisions to spend a week on the ho@@ tel and transferred 23 8@@ 17 ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b is assured , but nonetheless ) .
Why , then , does this article contain T@@ em@@ an complain that it has received no support from Airbus ?
A@@ IR@@ E A@@ IR@@ B@@ B
I am looking for people who have already used b@@ n@@ b just to reassure me .
I am planning to pay an ac@@ ross-@@ the-@@ board rate and a month &apos; s time , but I am rather afraid to send £ 1 600 to a site which I have never really heard .
But where are we going ?
“ Sup@@ ply the troops , ” s@@ ang the $ B@@ u of all .
That is why I am not .
I am sure that it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurdish people who died in hal@@ ab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends have succum@@ bed to anything other than to the chemical bombing of S@@ ad@@ ha@@ r in the cold .
Unless the content of the article was radically amended by the author , your comment is in@@ ept ( to remain pol@@ ite ) .
Moreover , how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
The author ’ s style should not be hy@@ per@@ me@@ ted : “ To seek weapons of mass destruction . ”
We agree .
You believe that it is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education .
This is never the time to increase education , because we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively , it is TO@@ U@@ J@@ O@@ UR@@ S the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war .
There would already be a lot of education , if ‘ the ’ were to work 35 hours instead of 17 .
Today , our teachers are gaining more than engineers .
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme .
But that does not happen , because National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college / school with its pro@@ s , so they bo@@ w home .
A kind of forced tele@@ labour , except that the employer does not pay the computer , the Internet connection , or supplies .
Moreover , it is so much the 17@@ th per week and four months of holiday that we are not able to fill the CA@@ P@@ S of m@@ th@@ s , you have come to expect .
How do you not want you to col@@ late poorly educated chi@@ ves whose parents c@@ ling to you in dealing with them ?
I believe that the priority in this area is to dis@@ arm the ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts so that the k@@ ne@@ e population can better flourish .
Where the Bush administration has done absolutely everything .
My first gradu@@ ate job was in the sale in London to earn three times nothing , yet it was a job for which a diplom@@ a was needed .
A year later , I saw an announcement to be working for the London me@@ tr@@ o , that was GBP 5 000 per year , and not even the patent was called for .
I have never regret@@ ted .
In this respect , please do not do this if you do not find a gradu@@ ate job , try to find something or pay for it , or you like to do it .
If I had stay@@ ed for gradu@@ ate jobs , I would still have to pay my student student .
I do not like the work in business so much , so I hope in the long term to go through the civil service either in the academic world .

How best to reduce the number of unemployed gradu@@ ates ?
To get rid of the b@@ is@@ light networks as art / letters / theat@@ re / media / philosophy / political science is to say what is known as the unemployed .
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished production .
It turned out that the important thing was not a diplom@@ a but , as the article says , a good professional journey , starting at school and throughout the university .
Admittedly , the starting wage was lower , but the level is rapidly rising , because in the real world what matters is results more than knowledge .
This debate has been going on for years .
Scienti@@ sts cannot solve all the problems , it is more important to be able to rise in the morning , to get to work and to inter@@ act with people in order to achieve results .
Poli@@ tics , philosophy and art are b@@ is@@ wel@@ t networks ?
That is ridiculous .
I assume that you are talking about the type of study that is carried out by the media or whatever else you have gone to .
Poli@@ tics , philosophy , political science and art are real networks .
We need people who can explain the big questions to pupils , who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature , art , etc . , and value them .
Would it not be better to have a real territorial policy to dis@@ rupt Paris and to boost the rest of France ?
Personally , I do not see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Es@@ s@@ ne and the V@@ al-@@ d ’ O@@ ise doing 8@@ 0@@ km aller@@ gies every day to come to Paris .
In@@ tra@@ -@@ me@@ at@@ os and the small bel@@ t already have many different forms of public transport in a different way ( me@@ tr@@ o , buses , tra@@ ms ) .

Good .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ alised by the 2@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , we hope that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark .
So much for their great experience in the field .
There was no room for U@@ U S@@ E@@ U@@ L to c@@ ling bic@@ yc@@ les .
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ d Del@@ an@@ o@@ e … .
Well , that is not at all .
When we talk to pedestri@@ ans and other public transport users for reasons why they do not ped@@ dle it , I think the main reasons are : 1 / c is hy@@ per@@ -@@ hazardous with all these bul@@ l@@ doz@@ ers , these tr@@ uc@@ ks , those co@@ o@@ ters that drive fast and look at the survival of bic@@ yc@@ les 2 / one are getting to the bottom of the road , we need to reduce the speed of road congestion , to be able to keep the code of the route written for 100
H@@ ur@@ ricane paths are apar@@ theid , we must co@@ exist , but re@@ balance the occupation of urban areas .
Nothing about bic@@ yc@@ les in the big Paris ?
Not a word about cyc@@ ling in public transport ?
EF@@ EL@@ V is right .
The target of 15 % in bic@@ yc@@ les is ridiculous .

It is not Russia .
Not to love the way in which the world is developing .

My children are not a financial asset .
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the EC@@ HR , but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been lod@@ ged .
In addition , they should submit complaints first in Germany or Ukraine .
I also expect these cases to be postponed until the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the resulting criminal investigation .
O@@ ut@@ side , however , Libya has not b@@ reached P@@ an A@@ m 103 either .
Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a Air@@ lines is not wrong , the fault lies with the airspace security authority , in this case the Ukrainian Government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had been slaughtered before , Ukraine launched an air attack on the rebels , and all aircraft could of course be considered as a possible and immediate threat .
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat , or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people in order for airlines to pay the right to over@@ flight land ?
Where all of the pro-@@ Ki@@ ev out@@ cry are defending their u@@ sur@@ ping government / ultra-@@ nation@@ alists in Western Ukraine – and who want to demonstrate in large terms that Putin has shot M@@ H@@ 17 flight .
As far as I know , there is already a complaint against the Ki@@ ev Government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sk@@ ies .
The precedent : a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Con@@ tra@@ s in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions .
No chance that Russia will leave this matter to the IC@@ J .
It is fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t wants to tell Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia .
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations .
So far , the investig@@ ators have said nothing about this .
To call it Ric@@ ardo and to be such a baby , it is appalling !
To call it P@@ ol@@ ary is a good thing .
There is only one question : is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday ?
I cannot fail to point out that those who are most critical of the Pi@@ ke@@ tty book have not read it !
It is easy to read , I put it a few days .
It shows the statistical evolution of res@@ titu@@ tion , res@@ ale capital , unequal concentration , inequality of labour income , capital ownership , deserves and inher@@ it@@ ance in the lo@@ g .
It shows that the concentration of today &apos;s capital is in line with the beginning of 20 ° before 19@@ 14 , shows that it was the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital , from 19@@ 14 to 1945 , and then the concentration resumed after ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : you do not .
I would like to ask you how long it took you to read this pa@@ v@@ é in the knowledge that an individual &apos;s capacity for concentration has some limits .
Secondly , the question is not whether it is easy to read .
The question is whether the summary of the central theory of the press is right or not .
If it is right , we can debate it without having read the book , the most important of which is to make a one-@@ way street .
No , it is easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : how long have you put to read it ?
Is the central theory of its pa@@ v@@ é summar@@ ised by the press wrong ?
I have not read and will read it out .
I am therefore relying on the summary of his central thesis , and that is what seems to me to be a fu@@ tu@@ re-@@ proof matter .
The notion of gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Has humanity not generally enriched itself ?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ ai is an impressive figure and deserves no doubt .
But remember that it is only 17 years old .
An age in which most people are just starting to find their place in the world .
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the young gir@@ l and will find her way to a happy life .
The problem is not the price , but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old ad@@ age that col@@ our@@ ful per@@ ver@@ ts are the embo@@ di@@ ment of evil .
My best wishes to Mal@@ ala , but she must realise that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the work@@ places of Britain !
Some@@ one thought that his speech was a little strange .
She than@@ ked her father for giving him a great deal of freedom but mentioned that , if she was not where she is now , she would have been married to 14 years .
Is Mal@@ ala herself not part of these “ col@@ our@@ ful per@@ ver@@ ts ” ?
You should not have &apos; time of an@@ ten@@ ne &apos; on this site .
You yourself are a horri@@ ble perverse .
That is absolutely appalling .
No , his father was not going to mar@@ ry him to 14 years .
She was 15 years old .
His father leads a school where girls are in school and it is in favour of equal rights for women .
It is , and has always been , for it to receive higher education and for it to have the right to decide its marriage itself .
But it is someone who is unusual in Pakistan , because he believes that women are equal to men .
What she said is that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 years , without having her say .
It has not been so eloqu@@ ently stated for you that it has not been so eloqu@@ ently formulated .
This may seem contradictory , but perhaps it would say that , if her father had not given her freedom , she would have been married to 14 years .
Rather than this entry into the season 4 , and especially by J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , which clearly has little difficulty finding his so@@ y character of Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ tri@@ ich .
I have just looked at the two very different seas@@ ons that are quite different , but I have to admit that it is one of the best of horror , one of the most successful .
The first fascin@@ ating episo@@ de .
The achievement is close to perfec@@ tion , and J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ’ s S@@ ho@@ w s@@ ang the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on Mar@@ s de Bow@@ ia .
I have not yet looked at this new season ( which will be the last to me , without beef beef ) .
In the case of American H@@ ory St@@ ory , I would have preferred to have seen 13 episo@@ des from 3 to 4 months .
One thing , however , apart from the extraordinary J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange , is the risk of the scenes and of the mountains that have taken place .
In A@@ H@@ S , there is an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans that makes it difficult to make a mo@@ ck@@ ery of today ’ s production .
It is a little escap@@ ing me to see you throw the way ahead for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting for the quality of the day .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but , as you say so well , there is much more besides .
It is quite simply that , for me , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ( and , above all , his path and the way in which it is used ) is really U@@ U ’ s pillars outside of the technical qualities .
It is a good ba@@ g for me .
Then I think it is a matter of writing .
The season 3 was slightly below , in 2 it was too dis@@ per@@ sed despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I see them as having 10 seas@@ ons from American H@@ ory St@@ ory or it will end up as 24 hours .
But everyone is doing what they want .
It is by what I say ‘ I will no longer look ’ that everyone is obliged to do that !
I simply agree with my point of view , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , J@@ E believes it will be fatal .
Now , however , that is my opinion .
Let us talk less about tax increases , please - let us go down in government spending .
No , increase spending please .
Those who wanted to sab@@ otage spending failed .
Dis@@ par@@ ting po@@ le@@ m@@ ics about relatively small items of expenditure , such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for , and for all that time some , in every camp , pretend that these nu@@ ances are much larger and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them in bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of expenditure .
The “ debt ” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country .
The “ debt ” is nothing to worry about .
I would not see any problem with the government approaching a third of my income ( even before talking about consumer taxes ) if I thought that it would use it properly .
But that is not the case , and many taxpayers have the same feeling .
It is said that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age has not been quite honest about how to cut taxes but , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development aid , Hi@@ gh S@@ pa@@ ed 2 , subsidies to wind tur@@ b@@ ines , and nuclear power stations that cost twice as much as they should , you come to a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Li@@ br@@ -@@ De@@ m a great lau@@ gh .
The first £ 10 000 is not tax@@ able .
This means that someone who ear@@ ns £ 35 000 a year will pay about £ 5 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone with £ 50@@ ,000 would pay around £ 10 000 ( a fifth ) , etc . , and someone with £ 200 000 pays about GBP 70 000 ( just over a third ) .
And social contributions ?
The greater the social security contributions , the more local taxes , the more par@@ king charges and the car stic@@ ker , and it is before VAT .
Almost exactly 30 % of my money is deduc@@ ted from the source before local taxes and car stic@@ ks .
I am paid in a decent but not extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant way .
This is not a problem , of course , I am happy to pay my taxes .
But let us not pretend that the money falls from the sky , or that it is not important to know where billions of tax p@@ ounds are going .
How can an unemployed person who seeks work at the door prove this ?
Even so , 20 % of the unemployed would not seek , that is to say 80 % are seeking and are not finding .
Since I am unemployed , I have more interest in what others are seeking or not .
Whether a potential recru@@ it@@ er receives 10 or 20 C@@ V .
Indeed , I have not had any news from Po@@ le Employment for months , does that mean that the agents are more engaged in monitoring operations than really getting employment announ@@ cements back ?
I do not see interest .
Because it is not up to the state to provide work .
If Po@@ le Employment does not provide enough jobs , then we must move from Po@@ le Employment .
What is a sensitive issue ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case it is ensured that the unemployed do their homework in return for their rights .
Just as a contro@@ ller calls for their transport title to users of a means of transport , a service leader or employees of their work , etc .
No one is sh@@ ou@@ ting the scandal in these cases .
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights : the only two times I had a case at Po@@ le Employment , my rights to the ARE had been poorly established , and on one of the dossiers , cut by 40 % , we had to fight hard .
It takes time !
I am not an expert .
P@@ lan@@ ning and control are taking precedence at the moment , while the status of a state Po@@ le Employment is , in fact , close to being an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees , they are the ones who pay for them .
Un@@ employed politicians and French are granting rights that they do not actually have !
That is not normal .
I would add that dignified unemployment insurance is involved in the recovery of wage work .
More than waiting for the mur@@ der@@ ous tw@@ ins in Arab@@ ic ...
In fact , there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop I@@ sis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would then appear to be the spread of the black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with the war and population movements at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is had the spirit of banning H@@ ad@@ j from M@@ ec@@ ca this year to Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms from the three countries affected .
El P@@ is reports that 7 400 have seen their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or their recent journeys .
In fact , there was the case of a pil@@ gri@@ m in Bosnia that contr@@ acted the M@@ ec@@ ca vari@@ ant during the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980 ’ s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m@@ in coming from Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same spirit of mind .
Is it the case that it is very much to propose that the people of E@@ bol@@ a should be prevented from flying for Europe ?
I thought it was just common sense , but apparently those &apos; who know &apos; decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people ...
These West African countries in which E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be kept strictly quar@@ ant@@ ine .
No one is left out .
Only health workers can enter .
It is 21 days after having treated patients before they can go .
If they take on the E@@ bol@@ a virus while they are there , they stay there until they are cu@@ red .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Only last week people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa , although they took &apos; all necessary precautions &apos; .
This disease can be stopped .
It is spreading mainly by the airlines .
Let us ban them from flying to these countries .
Furthermore , customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of E@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be immediately put into quar@@ ant@@ ine .
Let us get the message from the first and the group ( including religious ) second , and he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt whether he is capable of creating a dogma of God &apos;s image of the total cor@@ tex of the planet .
It is still a long way from this .
It is only 20 years since the information came into being as the given premium of humanity , while religion , which was born of the brain , runs our actions since Lu@@ c@@ y .
What is the point of becoming yet another Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who have not noticed , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely a minority in France today , no one is forced to join .
Those who critici@@ ze do not , in any case , stand up to the Church , but only to the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France .
What is the next step , what is the notion of sin , too much &apos; an@@ xi@@ gen &apos; ?
&apos;@@ O@@ ren@@ ad@@ ise : S@@ or@@ ry the church does not have a limited vision for France .
And in the world , this can be done to reach more world ...
@ Mar@@ ine E , to be honest ( as usual ) , respect for others , as you see it , existed in the chair .
H@@ ill@@ el a century before he said : &apos; do not do others what you do not want you to do , that is the whole Tor@@ ah and the rest is only a comment : go and study ! &apos;
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity , but it is introduced .
Your &apos; advance justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity &apos; but without God ?
It is a return to communism .
It is a step in the right direction .
Je@@ sus will remain the her@@ o who has upset moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be prepared to play their part in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity .
Not very Catholic ?
I think I remember that the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France is mainly due to the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and then converted into immigration a few centuries ago .
I hesitate to buy that , the new A@@ link game , or W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 .
And the new E@@ li@@ te game will soon come .
That is not the case .
Personally I would choose So@@ M .
I like W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 ( I even took part in his campaign to raise funds ) , but I do not think that this is going to be £ 30 .
If it is the P@@ C version that is of interest to you , Green M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is currently selling S@@ M at £ 30 and also proposes a good 20 % reduction .
Green M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is currently selling S@@ M at £ 30 and also proposes a good 20 % reduction .
I will look at it .
Of course , it is not at work .
The joy of the computer department is blocking all the sites .
Is it a good day that it is £ 30 and 20 % reduction , or is the GBP 30 a 20 % reduction ?
But let us be careful : the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
It took me by surprise , I bought it , but cannot play it .
In addition , I bought him on Ste@@ am , so no re@@ payment is zero .
It is time to buy a new video card .
It is a Brazilian site , but you get a valid Ste@@ am , I believe .
I have not used it myself .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ on £ 30 for P@@ C , £ 35 for X@@ bo@@ x 3@@ 60 and P@@ S@@ 3 , £ 44 for X@@ bo@@ x and P@@ S@@ 4
Thank you , I would be afraid that one day they would remove it from your libr@@ ary if they decide to cr@@ ack down on people who buy it there when they are out of the region .
So look at the B@@ et@@ te version of E@@ li@@ te : D@@ ang@@ er@@ o .
For example , was France in 19@@ 40 a “ pu@@ ri@@ al ter@@ rain ? ”
Therefore , this Nobel Prize is all very well for me .
We need to love France with 40 , that of &apos; the strange defeat &apos; .
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature , one won@@ ders whether P@@ rou@@ st or Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
The Nobel lau@@ reate is not even an event ; it is not even a matter of reading the authors .
Are Brazili@@ ans , Chinese , or Austr@@ ali@@ ans going to read Mo@@ di@@ ano , who is already hard to read in French , and who describes such a limited uni@@ verse and bar@@ gain ?
I hope that the others are more credible but , frankly , I doubt .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , Mus@@ s@@ o is only a distant report with literature .
Have you read it at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
That would be better to judge .
The Chinese , Brazili@@ ans and others do not worry for them .
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture .
They
Mo@@ di@@ ano , if they are not familiar with it already !
On your side , continue to attend L@@ é@@ ory and Mus@@ s@@ o .
I agree with you .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me Mus@@ sa@@ o all have their chances .
So let us see who won the Nobel Prize for literature : H@@ . H@@ .
P@@ ut in 2005 , D@@ .

Since I have led one in Iceland , I will stop seeing K@@ ia S@@ ports everywhere .

Mr Dan@@ ra , always the hatred ?
Good day D@@ Q - no , not today , I took my med@@ als .
That is Wednesday !
I have had a few days of rest .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the celebration of beer and the ci@@ der of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was a matter of course .
I managed to disgu@@ ise 19 different beer , W@@ ob@@ b@@ y We@@ af@@ t being one of my fav@@ our@@ ites .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mix@@ ture of people there , but there were not just some of the few fana@@ tics ( not to be confused with cam@@ era fana@@ tics ) .
Con@@ tro@@ lling on the return of Sunday was really tough .
On Monday evening we went to the grand@@ father of a po@@ t to play the n@@ ann@@ y .
Thanks to a real chance of beginning , I have been able to go back to several decent points .
I hope that if I come to 95 years I will be as keen as it is .
Last night I went to a chi@@ p bar in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my be@@ ver@@ ages has arrived with a fo@@ g of te@@ eth .
I ad@@ mire Mr .
Re@@ ad a little Bou@@ d@@ d@@ ha and you will understand how wrong you are , Mr Christian .
Having said that , without wishing to upset you , I believe that you are moving a little further away from the subject .
This is all very well , and it prohibits qu@@ e@@ ues for ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts from the mo@@ squ@@ es .
It is immediately indicating the arms trade .
Either we have a great deal of open eyes like Med@@ de@@ b and Tai@@ pa or Bou@@ b@@ ker , and we have a big eyes .
We have to choose .
It is not by keeping our eyes closed that we have the light .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , dear Christian , but once again you make a monu@@ mental nonsense : all the authorities , organisations or representative associations , Muslim or otherwise , having formally condemned the IS and its crimes , the French , Muslims or not , have nothing to add to these formal official convictions .
Who does not say a word .
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims , Arab or African .
Not like French .
Unfortunately , dear K@@ en@@ o@@ ch Mer@@ v@@ el , there is doubt for everyone .
As I have said a thousand times , there are doubts about the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be fool@@ ish and fool@@ ish to accuse them of a pri@@ ori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong .
In my view , this principle is the neg@@ ation of the re@@ public and can only help to undermine French society .
There is no doubt , so to speak .
Who does not say a word , but what do we do ?
A close proximity to E@@ I or the conviction of E@@ I .
The silence is a practical one , and it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the go@@ ats and the ch@@ ick@@ ens .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but pragmatic .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , during the elections , “ take reven@@ ge ” from the parties represented in West@@ min@@ ster because a huge gap has increased between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence .
Cameron must be che@@ ated with the idea of losing all these seats in West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must lau@@ gh .
What are these threats ?
The Conservatives are completely f@@ ond of Scotland , since they have no basis .
They can do what they want with electoral impunity .
I do not think that even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Lab@@ or losing seats in West@@ min@@ ster to the S@@ N@@ P is a good thing for him and the Conservatives .
Who is going to pay a gun for the Labour Party .
They are going to get rid of the S@@ N@@ P and UK@@ IP completely in Scotland , which will cut their heads in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ band joined the &quot; P@@ RO@@ M@@ ES@@ SE &quot; thinking that he saved his party but did not realise that he signed the death sentence for his Scottish Members .
Not surprisingly , some Labour MEPs are asking their leader .
If the S@@ N@@ P gains 20@@ -@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives , they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralisation .
I think that is the important thing .
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected in England one day .
C@@ losing the 8 % p@@ um@@ ps to the detriment of 85 % is not an electoral super-@@ strategy .
In addition , once Scottish Members are unable to vote on matters relating to England , the Conservatives will win all the votes .
O@@ h , I think it is .
Cameron may not have much to lose , but M@@ ili@@ band .
It did so with the Ul@@ ster Uni@@ onists , and it was successful .
Yet he is still in li@@ e@@ u to be prime minister in 2015 , and since he won the Labour Party .
So , basically , these bo@@ xes will be virtually behind each read@@ er to look over his shoulders and see what he says , how he reads , and to the end .
It is “ the life of the others ” of East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B applied to the world of the F@@ R@@ I@@ C …
There is also the same fasc@@ ination for surveillance techniques .
In the long term , this will at least have a ster@@ il@@ ising effect .
I look forward to the next ticket : A@@ ma@@ z@@ on produces V@@ O@@ T@@ ER@@ E according to V@@ O@@ T@@ E , and this automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of its secrecy !
It is like the world .
For@@ give it .
Thank you for the article .
As under this system , the management of the D@@ R@@ M@@ s is not im@@ pl@@ anted , it is left to me to read the pir@@ ated files , the public domain books or purchased with a few publ@@ ish@@ ers who have the intelligence to offer files without a lot .
Given the price I have paid for the K@@ ob@@ o , it is without regret .
I am amazed at the widespread ab@@ dic@@ ation of users in the face of widespread ownership of their privacy .
You will always see that everyone is giving their loyalty card ( f@@ an , of the French public , of the French public ) .
There are also demanding ma@@ ster@@ pieces whose opening and completion rates are probably der@@ is@@ ory .
For example , “ Fin@@ ne@@ g@@ ans W@@ ak@@ e ” from James Jo@@ y@@ ce .
@ Thomas : In the age of Bi@@ g D@@ ata , the facts do not really need to be personal to be relevant .
We must be careful not to put all the literature into the same b@@ reath .
The collection of an@@ onymous data when there is a profile …
The harvest is not an@@ onymous .
It is the data published by K@@ ob@@ o that are , not allowing read@@ ers or authors .
But K@@ ob@@ o has all that information .
There have been so many exaggerated , er@@ ron@@ eous and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government over the last few days that the country seems to be led by a mother class full of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ran@@ kings .
This is even worse if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Er@@ dog@@ an .
It is interesting that some of Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s supporters believe that Islamic is such an insult that they delete your comment , but not mine .
Of course , Turkey does not want to sho@@ ot itself in the foot unless it gains anything .
If it attacks I@@ SIS , I@@ SIS will come up , then it is actually sho@@ oting itself out .
A retirement diplom@@ at writ@@ es on his blo@@ g : “ The A@@ P reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to over@@ throw the Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad , because that would endanger Israel ’ s security .
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious re@@ pris@@ als or whether it was simply advis@@ ing caution .
This second option is more likely and , in any case , what is really surprising is that , today , the Iranian and US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria , Israel and the security of the region .
Indi@@ an P@@ un@@ ch@@ line ’ s reading is to be strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the n@@ in@@ e-@@ min@@ e@@ age of traditional media , and the short article you provide is important and should be read , bearing in mind earlier realistic and warnings from Iran to Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980 .
Who are these “ moder@@ ates ” who seriously fight the horrific secular Assad and , at the same time , the per@@ ver@@ ts of I@@ SIS ?
The pipelines policy is pushing the world into the ab@@ ys@@ s , and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “ moder@@ ates ” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War .
“ Is it even worse if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Er@@ dog@@ an ” there are other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?
I have one in mind .
There should be a N@@ u@@ rem@@ berg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks .
What is needed ?
Do you realise that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of still being alive ?
A little late for that , my po@@ t ...
Would the criminals not be barely old now , such as 120 years ?
A little late for that , not ?
Particularly with regard to the C@@ U@@ P tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate , which planned and led the genocide , Tal@@ a@@ at and D@@ j@@ em@@ al , killed just after the 1@@ st World War on reven@@ ge by the Armen@@ ians , and En@@ ver killed by the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks in a brea@@ th@@ less place of Central Asia at the same time , when there was a dream of building a Turkish empire .
What a s@@ ore !
There is an impressive ma@@ ster@@ y of the fall@@ acy of the fatal pen@@ sion@@ er , but apart from that , we are looking in vain for real contact .
There is no room for argument .
The fo@@ e@@ us will always hear a heart that is even fighting in the wom@@ b of a bearing mother .
F@@ les@@ bian couples can simply be a child &apos;s desire and not a desire to be accepted .
This is also true .
Children !
What a shame to designate them as future psychological dis@@ equilibrium .
One day they will have the age to defend themselves , to say that they are happy to live , to earn their living and to pay for this lad@@ y ( ? )
The G@@ PA is no doubt a temporary &apos; solution &apos; in the development of medicine in our world .
It is not today .

This is still the case , so we are being made ...
The important thing here is that this practice should be regulated so that the body &apos; s &apos; commerci@@ alisation &apos; is limited .
But cosmetic sur@@ ger@@ y , cosmetics are not as commerci@@ alised as the bodies .

It is , of course , more e@@ leg@@ ant to get a good country off the ground via the Internet and P@@ ay P@@ al than to shoulder its responsibilities and to avoid scandal in another centuries close to home without sh@@ ou@@ ting it at that time on all the ro@@ of@@ s !
This was not done in the name of the church !
There are not only Christians and beli@@ ever@@ s who reject these practices ...
Nevertheless , the exploitation of bodies is a real problem .
O@@ h , this man is passionate about something .

I do not know why there are so many cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ous comments here about what Paul Ma@@ son says , perhaps they are put by people who have never been co@@ ol@@ ed , even for a few years !
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the football that awa@@ its your comments .
That is true .
Since the film of Tony Par@@ son , there is a shortage of reports that really reflects the reality of the culture of the north of England .
It is no wonder that Paul Ma@@ son has gras@@ ped the social and political context , he understands things .
The Northern Nor@@ ther@@ n still lives , but it has been fu@@ elled by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon .
Having said that , you can look at it if you are in the region of London in November : 9@@ 9@@ p@@ s@@ sou@@ l is going to go back from sou@@ ls , including full Northern Nor@@ ther@@ n , on Saturday 15 November in B@@ et@@ se@@ y Tro@@ t@@ wood in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .

The Palestinians have no partner for peace .
Unfortunately , Netanyahu never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace .
@ J@@ on@@ a@@ than : Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy occup@@ i@@ ers ( indeed , that was the case of R@@ ab@@ in ) .
It is clear that R@@ ab@@ in , Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred the peace settlement to peace .
He removed his clo@@ thes , the post on the ro@@ ck and entered water .
An Israeli had stolen them .

The Palestinian representative ( UN ) s@@ miles and added : and now that things are clearly set out clearly .
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bi@@ polar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not drop the guard ...
It is obvious that this is not the intention of the anti-@@ Israelis .
An@@ tic@@ on@@ ist : I have replied to you , I am saying : the global geopolitical report ...
This has always been the case since politics is glob@@ alized ...
E@@ vi@@ dently , avoided ...
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , for the creation of the Palestinian state , that is certain .
To create Israel you do not answer .
What power report has allowed the creation of Israel ?
An@@ tic@@ on@@ ist : the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force of strength today !
You are in doubt !
Moreover , it is not just about Rus@@ sell B@@ and , but the Guar@@ dian ’ s journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything that he does not have to say .
Much of what he says is nothing more than p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ists written in writing .
This shows that you do not understand what Rus@@ sell B@@ and says , or what No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky says .
It is just a continuation of personal attacks and ins@@ in@@ uations ( my 13@@ -@@ year-old daughter likes it well , which means that this is a question of im@@ maturity ) .
A truly vicious burden , with just a suspicion of awareness that Rus@@ sell B@@ and says some tru@@ ths , perhaps tru@@ ths which you prefer not to think .
T@@ ell us , this feeling is going to be increasingly widespread !
I can understand why B@@ r@@ and horri@@ fies some : sometimes he speaks in a pre@@ ten@@ tious way , and after all the absur@@ dities of t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids , he does give the impression that he is a starting populist , but the whole story of not voting has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my view .
The general consensus seems to be that it is right to say to people not to vote and to sit back and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview of Pa@@ x@@ man and other articles and vide@@ os he has put forward , he says that voting once every five years for Labour or the Conservatives ( or the Li@@ b D@@ ays I suppose ) , and to limit the democratic commitment to this is completely useless , for the two parties , to say that , rather than just voting and
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution ( because I believe that being politically active by presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting , as politicians are a sla@@ p in the face if they really risk losing the elections ) , but it is to be seen that all these con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding responses that make Je@@ sus say to young people are telling young people not to take the trouble to vote and just to hope that everything will go better .
Its solution is extremely questionable , and it would be good if people were to debate what it actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind .
Yes , thank you .
The rig@@ ging of the vote was completely distorted .
I am deeply irrit@@ ated by the fact that a bul@@ le@@ tin has been sli@@ pping into a ballot every five years , as my vote really does not count for anything .
I want more referendums , electronic voting , direct democracy and Members who report back to their voters locally .
In addition , I dispute the idea that the words of Rus@@ sell B@@ and are not the@@ irs ( written by others ) .
He is cle@@ ver enough to have his own words and ideas , even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-@@ establishment thin@@ kers and schol@@ ars from the counter-@@ culture that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne would like to combine under the &quot; p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ist &quot; label .
I am rather convinced that in a debate it would succeed in convincing Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne .
Perhaps that is what the Guar@@ dian could do , that Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e would do as Pol@@ ly To@@ y@@ n@@ be@@ e and inter@@ viewed Rus@@ sell on a v@@ er@@ anda , even with the h@@ all@@ marks of top heads of the world .
Like Ma@@ x K@@ e@@ is@@ er , who at the beginning attacked R@@ ous@@ el but eventually became one of his f@@ ans and invite him in his programme , it is all too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come .
It is a political speech that has existed for generations , but has been margin@@ alized by traditional media - including the Guar@@ dian - for generations .
In my view , this “ fron@@ t@@ loading ” reveals , above all , that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the history of history in which professional histor@@ ians have become a minority , and the exchanges of specialists have become poorer for the benefit of the kind of Science P@@ o .
I , for my part , had seen the intellectual attitude of Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ e@@ u as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need for a cul@@ pri@@ t , a scapego@@ at .
They develop some of the very rational reasoning , but this ration@@ ality is based on these scapego@@ ats , which are the ke@@ y@@ stone of their thinking .
I believe that for F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult the state was indispensable as guilty .
This is a very ar@@ cha@@ ic thought , the thinking behind it , which is also mag@@ ical .
The problem of the report is solved by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ ist , neo-@@ li@@ b and / or liber@@ tarian pen@@ sion@@ er ( both of which mark a tightening of the desire to eradicate the state , the first knowing how to look for the state ’ s rescue for its markets ) in the sense of less state / not state in F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult .
The old dream of the basis that is self-@@ organizing itself .
Its thinking is built on the guilt of the state : without this guilt , it does not stand up .
It says guilty , it says elimination , murder and sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
There is no support .
The totalitarian left remember the good old time , that of his go@@ d , Stalin , the small father of the people .
O@@ ul@@ ala , you may have read a ch@@ un@@ k too quickly if you took F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult &apos;s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apo@@ logy of K@@ home@@ ini .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ ent would no longer be am@@ used to attack Michel in this way ...
There is a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective , on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether we agree or not , it is an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
It is quite lau@@ g@@ hable to see the cab@@ in or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by scientists in the human sciences of the left who do not bear the br@@ unt of the al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ as .
The nar@@ c@@ iss@@ is@@ me and the author@@ itarianism of these people are un@@ restra@@ ined .
One important point to add seems to me to be the post@@ uring of these &apos; rebels &apos; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of Chinese and other “ y@@ el@@ low ” in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You did not have the pleasure of hearing our Austr@@ ali@@ an friends on this subject .
And where was it in Russia , that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I do not remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time .
In London , and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia , in the 1990s last time , in a market .
The Chinese think of the white people !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou a long time ago , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them speak viol@@ ently anti-@@ B@@ lan@@ cs .
My father is not happy with his el@@ dest daughter with a B@@ lan@@ c .
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and , above all , in recent years : they are becoming increasingly rich , prosperity is spreading outside the big cities , and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live .
As I have been told , the Russians are above all prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia , who work in professions and in areas where they have a great chance of being exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence .
Although I have lived on the shores of the I@@ en@@ is@@ se@@ i River in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
Unfortunately , I heard the views of the Austr@@ ali@@ ans on the Chinese and the Ab@@ original .
It really is bizarre that a foreign@@ er tells me that I am not shoul@@ dering the Chinese , when I met two in my life ( including one abroad ) , did not keep a bad memory , all people are worth and , in fact , those in London were very good that is the only reason I remember they were Chinese .
Otherwise we do not remember who is meeting , all people are worth , how to remember who was who was .
You know what is bizarre .
That you and the other Russian are talking about Chinese as a kind of unique fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attr@@ action in a zo@@ o .
And yet you always come out with B@@ lan@@ c .
How many Chinese men are with white men , by comparison ?
No , because there is a great deal of chance that the parents of these B@@ lan@@ ches will aggres@@ sively attack them .
No measure of the im@@ partiality of justice .
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that remains manipul@@ ated by groups strongly left on the left such as the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate ’ s trade union …
It is a for@@ gi@@ veness , but the legal circles are frankly entitled .
When the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate , he re@@ pres@@ ses only 25 % of judges .
If a measure of its bias can be made from the rela@@ tivity of the law enforcement in the courts , it comm@@ its two obstacles .
W@@ ho@@ ever has an observer ’ s political vision like that of the judge ’ s factual interpretation .
Then there is the forced tool of the law to re@@ focus the evaluation on fundamentals .
The measure of its in@@ observance in all judicial acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , including public prosecu@@ tors , forces to distinguish between the error and the bias of the judges .
It would be pointless to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups .
The claim and the lack of knowledge are not an objective analysis .
And if all this is not analysed , how can we say that justice is improving in France ?
If it is only through statistics that implic@@ itly show that it is going down well .
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio .
The corruption of the judiciary .
As a proportion of the amount of nu@@ is@@ ance power that is given to the judicial institution that is capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The area that is considered to be the treatment of he@@ irs committed to the method of fraud in the case of non-@@ gener@@ al@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ gy@@ ists being sc@@ attered by the no@@ tar@@ ies of no@@ tar@@ ies .
This profession is getting EUR 150 million a year , while benefiting from the hedge cover provided by the virtual judicial impunity of French no@@ tar@@ ies .
For understanding their mechanism , part of it was reported in the following comments .
Where this acc@@ ords with the so-called moderate statistical improvement in the previous comment , it is that the judicial institution has produced , in many disputes between gener@@ al@@ o@@ g@@ ists and he@@ irs that are reluctant to do so , a whole set of legal cases that are contrary to all the laws of the inher@@ itors .
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring these kinds of rational criteria not in the form of a form drawn up ?
P@@ rice prices are certainly totally prohibi@@ tive .
There is still material to cover up the disabled .
That can be said , but my bro@@ ther has one of those tri@@ ps on the ground , built on the size and weight of it , and it really has allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal whe@@ el@@ chair , whe@@ el@@ chair@@ s and con@@ ge@@ sted ty@@ res .
As we say , the g@@ ates and col@@ ours ...
T@@ an@@ k@@ ai@@ ri resemb@@ les what Je@@ re@@ my C@@ lar@@ k@@ son could invent for a challenge in To@@ p Ge@@ ar .
T@@ an@@ k@@ air is the E@@ IP@@ Q@@ EU .
I believe that the inven@@ tor of the W@@ h@@ ill has never had to clean a dog over a ch@@ ink .
I am sure that my s@@ ister would love the tri@@ angle on the ground , but that is simply too expensive .
The whe@@ el@@ chair of ul@@ tr@@ a long distance would be perfect for a handic@@ ap with a pen@@ sion@@ er for the long run .
Here there are h@@ ills .
The prices seem to be high , but there are really people who put such prices in a bic@@ ycle , so &apos; you see &apos; .
The tri@@ angle on the ground seems particularly useful to me .
Not all disabled people are poor , however .
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available .
Only if they have become disabled .
The s@@ cra@@ p is that the whe@@ el@@ chair &apos;s market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford to practise high prices for things they know full well .
It cannot really be said that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
This is an example of excessive design .
Unfortunately , it is just a draft , and it is not intended to produce it .
I am CO@@ NT@@ N@@ T that the whe@@ el@@ chair whe@@ el@@ chair is not coming onto the market , because apparently there is no way to conduct this rig@@ ged fi@@ g .
Almost 20 000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza , in intensive bombing of den@@ sely populated residential areas .
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 ( Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory , not Egypt ) .
Hal@@ f are children and young people who are under 18 .
The children of eight years have lived through Israeli blockade .
The unique situation in the world , which is unacceptable , is also illegal , since the blockade of a &apos; collective punishment &apos; has all the civilians in Gaza .

It would be better to have good insurance for the ship , ensure that it is 100 % in line with all the safety rules and ask those who manage and rivers the authorisation to carry out a commercial activity ( which they certainly refuse ) ; I have a boat and I have tried to see how to praise it ( in all honesty ) on Air@@ b@@ n@@ b .

Pri@@ ority and populist action
In fact , we do not know too much what Mari@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see this ?
Because the Germans have refused to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I am not sure that Spe@@ e really has “ refused ” to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed safe from the true strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ sia in his book “ C@@ ast@@ le of Ste@@ el ” suggests that Spe@@ e quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British co@@ ff@@ er in the area .
The sea was hard at the beginning of the day ; I do not know whether it was still the case at the end of the battle .
Likewise , the fight ended after the sun@@ sh@@ ine , making any rescue operation more difficult .
Comp@@ are that with the next battle , that of the Mal@@ ou@@ ines , where , on the photo@@ s showing the survi@@ v@@ ors that are being res@@ cu@@ ed , you see a calm and full sea .
Moreover , res@@ cu@@ ers knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this stage .
H@@ m@@ m , that does not really correspond to what I remember when I was reading this battle , so I made a quick research into Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia :
“ A degree of confusion among German ships about the fate of the two co@@ o@@ ked cr@@ on@@ ies , who had disappeared into the black after they stopped the sho@@ oting , and a k@@ ne@@ e-@@ jer@@ k continuation .
L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g lives on a fire , but by getting closer to it , it is just a wrec@@ k .
The N@@ ü@@ r@@ n@@ berg , slower than the other German ships , is in the late battle and is living in Mon@@ mu@@ th , pen@@ ned and seriously damaged , but still on the move .
Having pointed out its spot@@ light on the flag of the vessel , the proposal to go to the vessel was refused and it opened the fire , ultimately leaving the vessel .
Without reliable information , von S@@ pe@@ e judged that the Go@@ o@@ od H@@ ope had to escape and stopped research at 10.@@ 15 p.m.
Re@@ qu@@ ests of a British co@@ ff@@ er in the vic@@ inity , it has gone to the north . &apos;
So , if that is true , the Germans , let us try in the dark before the invention of the ra@@ d@@ ar , did not know that a ship had sun@@ k and therefore could not seek survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also believed that the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y had a larger co@@ al@@ gre@@ ed in the area that could have seriously damaged it , so in the confusion they disgu@@ ised to take advantage of their advance .
They were a long way from their base , and they were well aware that they should find a way through many Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y vessels .
C@@ ra@@ do@@ k ’ s sacrifice had already caused them harm , and they cut around half of their am@@ muni@@ tion , condemning them when they finally took .
There are a number of voices in the U@@ M@@ P calling for it to be enshrined in the law that a permanently condemned elected person is permanently in@@ eligible .
This is a courageous position , which would also affect left-wing elected representatives .
But no@@ o@@ on is a jo@@ ke .

When does the trade union ban in sectors already protected ?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens ?
A@@ ge@@ sted by politicians , whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , always quick to am@@ pli@@ fy the very people who will benefit from their in@@ sigh@@ tedness in order to obstruc@@ t the actions of real policies , which are really trying to make things move , not the fine words whose im@@ mobility is commensurate with their complac@@ ency .

It supports the existence of politic@@ ised trade unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party .
It would not defend the same the@@ ories if right-wing , or even extreme right-wing , trade unions were targeted at person@@ alities on its side and led to a judicial and media war .
Your statements are completely free of charge .
If , at the moment , the right is missing the legal news , it is simply that it has committed the facts that come under the law !
There is no such thing as a left-wing person who has had so much to do with justice , but all those who have received his attention have not had a favourable treatment .
On the other hand , it should be remembered that the union of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate , which is left-wing , is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and that it is minority .
Whether a minister supports the trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be .
The trade union that you refer to is perhaps a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but its influence is great to Chancellor , it is not a secret .
It is now won@@ dered whether the &apos; mission &apos; of some judges is not more s@@ ali@@ ent rather than being educated .
@ gu@@ us - you should be satisfied , the S@@ M is minority .

The end of a career
In fact , it is more likely to lead to a career than the typical ro@@ ck journey , even if in your dreams you think that all the gu@@ ys that smoke from grass in the gar@@ age of their father and swee@@ p three agreements on a po@@ em of primary school will surely become st@@ ars , and the only question is how much they want to reach .
What is worse than ridiculous is that it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that is rapidly coming to racism , because the sac@@ red eth@@ no@@ log@@ ists present us with these remote people as infin@@ itely super@@ sti@@ tious and pe@@ tty bi@@ go@@ try , while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired , like ours , by practical considerations on a daily basis .
Unless you interpret the other way around .
Or , rather than saying that the bu@@ ff@@ er is not sac@@ red , is it not better to admit that our Mari@@ ann@@ e and our M@@ DGs are not too sac@@ red ?
Our way of doing this is to see the sac@@ red as a kind of well-@@ defined object and circum@@ vent the religious sphere .
That is very interesting .
It is the de@@ ec@@ o E@@ ec@@ h@@ em@@ ere to m@@ our@@ n the vacuum .

Because what applies to ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology also applies to the interpretations of other discipl@@ ines .
This would provide a do@@ se of healthy mode@@ sty .
Your contempt for ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists is completely unjustified !
It is thanks to them that trea@@ sures , valuable testi@@ monies to rebuild history , understanding societies , and the example of comparative ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology are exciting .
This method is not a very old one , and the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists have previously relied on their “ inst@@ inc@@ ts ” and their knowledge , and could be wrong .

Let us do it then .
If you are so shocked by these &apos; pu@@ ri@@ fication b@@ ars &apos; , you are not obliged to participate , is it not ?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and E@@ bol@@ a , and that it is perfectly possible to do both and publish an article on gender .
Is this the subject that is shocking to you , or the fact that people are in the k@@ nees ?
Nevertheless , there is the am@@ ate@@ ur video of the crash .

But soon before the typ@@ ho@@ on , we knew that it came , but for which the F@@ O@@ M did not see fit to move the time of departure ( television , pu@@ b , money … ) .
But , apart from that , they protect the pil@@ ots well .
I also agree with that .
But there is also the fact that if the great F@@ O@@ M comes into the S@@ GP , it will allow Ni@@ co Ros@@ berg to have a chance to beat the English that then led ...
You give up on this blo@@ g my dear Dayton .
This is not serious , however , and I have a little time to start with all of your 10@@ -@@ 30@@ .@@ 00 .
No , it is not .
There have been many con@@ spir@@ acies in F@@ 1 , but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of a pilot victory at the expense of another .
It is not the F@@ O@@ M that comes out of the ba@@ it because it is the F@@ I@@ F .
It is important .
In the light of am@@ ate@@ ur images , the absence of an image makes it possible for the I@@ IA to avoid troub@@ les@@ ome issues : How is it that the Commissioner has a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident ( see the complete video after the accident ) ?
No , it is not because video is deemed too violent that the F@@ I@@ F is blocking the images of the accident , but because there is clearly one of the Commissioners with a green flag , a sign that the race can normally take place and that you are more under a y@@ el@@ low flag .
Some comments show a dark knowledge of F@@ 1 .
Yes , Mr E@@ hold , the race is no longer under a y@@ el@@ low flag , the place of the accident , hence the green flag .
That is the usual procedure .
The post of comm@@ is@@ aries just down@@ stream of the accident ( depending on the case , it may be 10@@ -@@ me@@ tre after the accident ) is the green light to tell pil@@ ots to resume a normal pace .
sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism is selling the pu@@ b .
Before I thought the media were part of the government &apos;s &apos; patri@@ otic &apos; propaganda offensive , but I am afraid that , ultimately , it is just for money .

In@@ os do exactly the same .
C@@ reat@@ ing the bu@@ z@@ z with inf@@ an@@ try , which we really do not need to care about , is right to continue to fear people so that they can continue to control them .

In view of the medical reference , “ tou@@ ching ” is much better said in this context than “ der@@ ail@@ ing . ”
I wonder whether all the people who are star@@ ving that E@@ bol@@ a might be able to spread by air realise that they now believe in developments .

A short and conc@@ ise article which makes a la@@ ugh@@ ing stock of this des@@ pic@@ able p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ journ@@ alism .
It has done me well .
It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism towards it .
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frigh@@ tened and frigh@@ tened ( without getting to the hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to get us off the ground when it needs it .
I think it is perfectly logical that , if we have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack , why not have a crisis in E@@ bol@@ a without any evidence ?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has itself invented .
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear ?

This is completely unnecessary .
As always when we talk about science .
Not only does the testi@@ monies serve no purpose : in isolation they cannot serve as a scientific material .
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts .
@ traffic : testi@@ monies cannot be used as a scientific material .
That is perhaps why we are abstaining from putting questions to patients in psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry when we have reliable observations from relatives .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric file mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t is an explanation that I have been educated tele@@ ph@@ ically by her mother .

Are you putting fan@@ ci@@ ful the@@ ories and facts at the same level ( which give rise to veri@@ fiable testi@@ monies ) ?

His summit , or a Ro@@ cher ’ s d@@ ust , is ri@@ fe in the middle of the Om@@ ar mo@@ s@@ que .
For Muslims , Mo@@ ham@@ med has risen to parad@@ ise from that ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it was M@@ a M@@ ori@@ ah , where A@@ ra@@ ham failed to sacrifice his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
At the moment it was taken and cont@@ ex@@ alised , there is no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also has its extremists , and it is worth rec@@ alling it regularly , and , unfortunately , they are reported to the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i Ben@@ net , A@@ vig@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Netanyahu , the government had accepted the plan to 2 states , and has repeatedly raised it ! ) .
It is also good to show how the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact .
Will God be able to recognise their own ?
The shor@@ test Jewish jo@@ ke : &apos; God is lau@@ ded ! &apos;
In order to bo@@ ast about tourism in Israel , we often have a half-@@ hear@@ ted na@@ ï@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ve , al@@ an@@ gu@@ ies on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usual , quite different from what advertising shows us , as we can see from the picture that illustrates the article .
There is a little fear .
This pho@@ to is a wonderful piece of propaganda !
It is a shame that the photo@@ grap@@ her of Re@@ u@@ ters did not look into the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to go to the M@@ oun@@ le M@@ oun@@ tain and who would prefer to c@@ ling the faithful Jews into a bar@@ rel , inviting the Wall to the wall .
@ M@@ at , if this photo@@ grap@@ h distur@@ bs you , it is right and proper , it is neither the newspaper nor the photo@@ grap@@ her , but this woman and the ideology that she is trans@@ mitting .
This system is not tenable and will end up in the w@@ ings .
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution .
E@@ ver since the economy appears to be s@@ mil@@ ing , large companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They have managed to convince their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages , while at the same time , and without hiding , they have given ever greater salaries to the small elite at the top .
You are right , it is not tenable , but it will only change in that country when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of going back and sle@@ eping when someone else is on the strike , supporting them , showing a bit of solidarity and understanding that their strike is not just about their problems , but also about your employer that we do not take people with impunity .
If we abandon democracy , in which case it is tenable .
I fully agree .
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
For example , China and India .
All this cannot be done well .
It is because we are in a democracy that has been held .
Have you voted for the T@@ T@@ IP ?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ IP ) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and states ( IS@@ D@@ S ) proposed by the agreement serves .
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people to the un@@ imagin@@ able damage that this agreement will have on our lives .
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about this in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ an World Development is therefore looking at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back .
Did Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill not say &apos; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &apos; ?
These are excellent effects , while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
This gentle@@ man is right , in X@@ V@@ III there were trade unions in all the govern@@ ors .
In the highly Catholic French army , there is a sacrificed dimension .
Le@@ a@@ ve it ( finally , its officers , the others , no one knows anything ) would believe that France ’ s e@@ ternal values are strong , and it will fight and will close its fur@@ y .
Then , with the decline of the country , globalisation , Europe , the crisis of values , in short , the dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this small re@@ lic , is comfor@@ ting .
Even if it is increasingly un@@ comfortable ...
They are still lacking the s@@ crip@@ t of married men , c@@ ali@@ br@@ aries , married women , c@@ ali@@ br@@ ates , lost dogs , and I do not know what yet yet .
If you do not write the French correctly , I am trade union .
You have been warned , that will be your fault .
In order to defend categor@@ ical interests , the protected professions with trade unions are already well enough , which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens .
We are asked not to lau@@ gh about the fear of risk by an official .
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees freedom of expression without trade unions , or without the right to strike as in Germany , in return for the protection they enjoy .
Otherwise , there is a disaster .
And with the car@@ t@@ els that are preparing , the government welcomes it .
What safety ?
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance indeed ...
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance for ignorance , I was referring to the military and other officials , since this is the subject here .
Let us assume that &apos; through its delegates &apos; in Article 8 of the preamble to the constitution of 19@@ 46 .
It will become &apos; 8 .
Every worker is involved in collective determination of working conditions and corporate management .
This is absolutely essential with the arrival of informa@@ tive power .
Yet you have opened , probably read and then commented on a specific article entitled “ The Great British B@@ ak@@ e O@@ ff Review ? ”
Wa@@ it , the section was there , every vacuum .
I thought we had to start talking .
In any case , it is the marriage of J@@ off@@ rey that I have looked at , and I can tell you that some people have been s@@ ounded .
In the case of J@@ off@@ rey ’ s marriage , one of the best ( though misleading ) moments was in the history of television .
So the late m@@ m@@ m@@ h ...
G@@ ame of Th@@ ron@@ es !
G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
This is the second time that , stran@@ gely enough , the programme ends with a victory for the least worst b@@ ak@@ er ; no one has acted as a &apos; but@@ ton ; that is my ca@@ ke now . &apos;
Perhaps the additional pressure from friends and relatives outside has finally had an effect on them ?
In the past few weeks , all those outside were kept out .
And there is also this idea of &apos; playing security , there is always next week &apos; , which dis@@ appears the last week .
I like co@@ o@@ king , but I do not imagine that I will do that .
I am grateful to those who do it and thus give us a super-@@ enter@@ tainment and push for new things .
Before G@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree , last year &apos;s last challenge , the marriage ca@@ ke , was absurd .
Prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als usually make days to do so , and they had to co@@ ok one in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three challenges were really difficult to share , I do not know how they were able to choose a winner .
In Lu@@ is , the only real defec@@ t that they were able to find was a little dry ( though I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that the green ice on Richard did not en@@ vy , in any case Richard had already lost at that time ) .
I have to say that several of the challenges of this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time available .
There is also the cancer that dri@@ ves , with solar wind .
There is no doubt that everything is successful at the moment .
This is a bad time for mankind , hopefully .
You confuse solar and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radiation .
The U@@ V@@ s are blocked mainly by the ozone layer , which is made up precisely by the impact of resid@@ ual solar and U@@ V par@@ ticles .
So , even if the mag@@ netic field were to weaken , there would not be enough solar wind to “ hun@@ t ” the o@@ z@@ o@@ sphere ozone .
There would even be more , and thus less U@@ V and “ canc@@ ers . ”
Fortunately , the ozone layer is not blocking the U@@ V .
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect .
If we limit ourselves to human beings , they have the interest of allowing us to have b@@ ones ( syn@@ thesis of vitam@@ in D ) , of heating ( less than in@@ tric@@ acies ) , of mod@@ ul@@ ating our immune system and , it seems , of improving our mor@@ ale .
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic U@@ V@@ s and leaves the U@@ V@@ A and most of the U@@ V@@ B .
You know that you are not obliged to be pat@@ ron@@ ising and to regard your interlocu@@ tor as a stay when you make a comment .
Especially for a minor prec@@ ision which was implied in the comment , which itself intends to be ped@@ ago@@ gical .
Without saying that I am a accustomed to mel@@ ting , the U@@ V only AC@@ C@@ L@@ E@@ R has its development .
They are not P@@ RO@@ V@@ O@@ Q@@ U@@ N@@ T .
The evidence is that not all b@@ ron@@ ze@@ es have mel@@ t@@ down .
Either , when a tu@@ b tells you that we must avoid the sun and live in a ca@@ ve , it is better not to listen because the U@@ V is necessary for every human being .
Ex@@ c@@ essive , however , is like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
U@@ V directly causes mel@@ ting .
Is it possible ?
And , more importantly , can we move on to the mixed ?
or switch to the mix ...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be pl@@ anted if there is sufficient force and the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 is perfectly acceptable .
I believe that the army would need something more resili@@ ent and has not yet adopted i@@ P@@ hon@@ e@@ 6 as communication material in the first line .
But for us , the others ,
It remains a good choice .
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be pl@@ anted if sufficient force is applied there .
A No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
In particular , is it already in force ?
This jo@@ ke is being made in every discussion .
I decided to count them .
It is the fourth jo@@ ke on the pl@@ ate that I read in the comments today .
It is difficult to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before specific software is inst@@ alled , one imag@@ ines that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain , and it is hard to see how it could come back .
So , m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ... .
The most likely is that this is a production unit on which the O@@ O@@ S has not been properly inst@@ alled and is therefore stuck with the plant test code inst@@ alled .
I do not know how they are doing these things .
But would they put test software on all ?
The photo@@ graph@@ s on E@@ b@@ ay clearly show the absence of F@@ C@@ C or EC lo@@ go and the presence of a red tape of proto@@ type .
The article for b@@ ob@@ o par excellence .
We want cheap products , and it is ama@@ zing that industri@@ alists produce “ industri@@ alists , ” but all teachers and small trade are concerned about how good it is , bi@@ o a@@ c € 16@@ 50 ( average ) .
However , in response to your post , if it is possible to eat with a small salary correctly .
After all , it is free to put its priorities where it sees fit .
For my part , food is one .
S@@ ome without ran@@ so@@ m
It is called b@@ ob@@ s , or better b@@ ob@@ lo@@ lo@@ s , of people who see the world through ideological “ software ” that leads them to dis@@ connect from reality .
That is the total un@@ bund@@ ling of thinking .
They are experts , for example , trying to save the planet because they have avoided taking a show@@ er .
He is also experts in st@@ ars , joining the g@@ au@@ a@@ avi@@ ar , which they sometimes come from , for example , by condemning CO2 emissions while travelling to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not bear this mi@@ xing of red and st@@ ren@@ te@@ ous ideology as well as being surprised to meet often with criticism about them .
W@@ ater@@ h , thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive the@@ or@@ isation and for all the associated details ( plane , swe@@ et … ) .
I would like to be a member of it , but I am not there .
The concept is not so complicated .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ lo@@ s are mon@@ ob@@ lo@@ c .
You understood the concept of lef@@ t-@@ ca@@ vi@@ ar ?
Well , you can understand the concept of b@@ ob@@ o@@ eco@@ l@@ o .
It is a perfect copy with just one ideological nu@@ ance .
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the eco@@ lo@@ ads .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ ch@@ o is one of them , but only the most visible part of the eco@@ lo@@ ads , because it is the one that inf@@ ers the media .
That is a fine game .
Ap@@ parently nobody wants to look at this game .
It is so bad that it is just like a female n@@ u .
You are next to the ca@@ p .
We must be part of the micro@@ co@@ s@@ m of art to understand the astonishing beau@@ ty of the truth of this work .
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not spent countless decades studying and pan@@ dering to great artists .
The important thing is not that E@@ mile does not know what to do and seems to be obs@@ essed with the same subject .
The important thing is that she has really managed to become a rich and famous country with no artistic capacity .
It is about the fact that the art of the art is over .
No , it is co@@ o@@ king .
The fact that E@@ mile does not know how to map out the car@@ pet
That is not really a proven fact .
It is rather an opinion .
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs that smoke by playing on the b@@ ail .
It may be problematic , but not in that case .
It is much more than just representing the real .
If you look at this , then a pho@@ to will do the business .
The author also speaks of E@@ mile &apos;s ex@@ es@@ per@@ ation .
Look again and let the picture speak for itself , without compar@@ ing it with the kind of design that you may prefer .
If that is so easy , why do you not ?
There is still a need to make savings : equi@@ ties , the number of public custody hor@@ ses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service ..@@ .@@ .
Un@@ honesty means that France is reducing its workforce , but as all countries have done , sometimes even more drastically , starting with Britain .
It is only half encouraging ...
Oper@@ ation without support , it quickly finds its limits .
A sing@@ ular approach , at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses , the shortcomings of our defence tool , especially in the Sa@@ hel .
This is a bad blow for the local authorities concerned , who lose a dimension of their activities , or even part of their history .
Where is the promised sanc@@ tu@@ ary ?
@ ed@@ mon@@ d : that is what I was saying , look elsewhere in the way of making savings but , above all , not in my own , in my own country that really is not possible ...
That is exactly what you are proposing to do , to look elsewhere where there is a certain amount of waste .
Whether all those who have come together or pro@@ lif@@ er@@ ate the military situation dare to come here and say here that there is no money wasted on this per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , and this without any s@@ ore ...
Let us apply the same po@@ tion to the public service as a whole and public finances will go a little better .
And for Jo@@ i : really : look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries , and you will understand why the defence can be a little charged !
Yes , the economies on which everyone agrees that they have to be done must be done , even though it is somewhere , not ?
Man@@ i@@ que of po@@ t , those on whom it falls victim to murder when it happens to them , the poor .
We should do this but , above all , it does not fall beyond me because , in this case , it is a crime and not an economy .
Gu@@ n@@ ul@@ ls !
How can we close the V@@ al de Gra@@ ce weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As for the local authorities , history is repeating itself to every closing post , maternity , hospital and bar@@ r@@ acks .
But everyone is for the economies of course .
It is bizarre , a May@@ or U@@ M@@ P , who wants compensation and does not look forward to savings in public spending .
This article is really the most st@@ agg@@ ering s@@ ister that I have ever read !
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who make the same bad jo@@ ke are doing the same .
It is the de@@ pressing to challenge his Fac@@ e@@ book thre@@ ad and to see that 80 % of his friends began their stat@@ utes with the phrase “ this embarrassing moment . ”
I believe they will make a film .
It will surely be based on ho@@ ly scenes , where someone comes into the bus by chance on the bus , going to work , and only realis@@ es that his judge has returned to his tr@@ ous@@ ers .
It is not embarrassing , it is completely .
Not really , in my view , the author adopts the role of British man who has always been taught to bur@@ y his emotions and s@@ wa@@ p te@@ eth .
I am sure that if you are a f@@ an of K@@ ate Bush , the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence has been a strong thing .
Do you realise that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have rights ?
I do not have the Internet .
I therefore do not think I can comment .
Not having a computer .
My go@@ d , I must make this film before dying !
I do not believe that this article is the most un@@ believ@@ able tr@@ ick I have ever read !
Char@@ lie has just shown that it is at the top of the co@@ sm@@ ic uni@@ verse of sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I would like to turn to the reverse .
It is absolutely essential that I agree with all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter so that they finally have the ill@@ um@@ inating and un@@ believ@@ able g@@ ul@@ f@@ s and the insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us that j@@ um@@ ped to Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s li@@ fel@@ ine as a div@@ ine g@@ ill .
Well , it really was no .
In particular , if it is not women , nor is it the case .
I am a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive development in democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective associations .
So far , we are taking away the right to save our planet from states that play the st@@ ars at every meeting to save the planet .
We are therefore deciding to take things in hand .
Together with the Commissioner that they have pl@@ anted energy , all these fine recommendations have taken place ..@@ .@@ .
Th@@ ink : E@@ oli@@ an and solar farms are tomorrow &apos;s R@@ on@@ ts .
That is all financed by the pay@@ able .
Please stop this pro-@@ nuclear speech .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
Rad@@ i@@ o@@ activity is far more damaging in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety , it is better to limit it to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is our only sal@@ vation , provided , of course , that our consumption is drastically reduced .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able electricity to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is not involved .
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions from production and ep@@ sil@@ sil@@ on for other steps .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity by wind or P@@ V is already more G@@ H@@ G on other stages and , above all , gas , or worse coal as in Germany , to compensate for inter@@ mit@@ tent .
Re@@ placing nuclear power with wind or P@@ V renewables would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
I am not insul@@ ting you , I am a physical scienti@@ st in physical sciences 198@@ 1 , I have done research into nuclear physi@@ cs , I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said .
For what I did not say it was you who gave me ideas , I did not say anything about Germany , but you did not respond to what I was saying and like all the right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ish the interlocu@@ tor I never do .
Furthermore , I quote from the experts man@@ dated by the German Government : the current programme of renewable energy is an un@@ profitable and inefficient way of reducing G@@ H@@ G emissions and should be stopped .
0 emissions if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction , and if you do not count the lower greenhouse gas v@@ ap@@ our of greenhouse gases than Co@@ 2 is a reminder of two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant in water v@@ ap@@ our and a little in river water .
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a &quot; South Asian giant &quot; ... !
Last time , Pakistan won against H@@ indu@@ stan .
It does not surprise me , most Indi@@ ans who make comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan .
In fact , that shows your mind@@ set .
It would have been the same if they had described the giant India of South Asia ...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are taking part , but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply open a P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box of corruption and ma@@ fia .
With regard to the I@@ SL , today &apos;s opening match has been surprisingly interesting , with the A@@ le@@ ti@@ co of Kou@@ k@@ ata imposing 3-@@ 0 against M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
Com@@ pared to the billions and billions that India de@@ votes to the I@@ PL and now football , how could we ever compete with our &apos; no@@ is@@ y neighbours &apos; ...
The race for the lo@@ w co@@ g is paying off .
That is a fine project .
In the case of the incident , the possible lack of design is manife@@ sted only with too cold an e@@ eli@@ um .
So it is perhaps not a lack of design , but implementation ...
Unlike ari@@ an@@ space , which is a private company , it seems that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insu@@ rer .
They are likely to pay the satell@@ ites on a f@@ us@@ s that knows .
This is all the more regrettable because many media are re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed by articles of articles , and many read@@ ers are only holding these securities .
In total , this creates a false impression of the content of the article itself .
Quite in agreement with you , the title is not appropriate , it is un@@ ju@@ stly calling into question the project , when it is only a problem of lan@@ dings .
