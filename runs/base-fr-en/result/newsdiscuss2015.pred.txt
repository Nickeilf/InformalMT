UK@@ IP , who deny those living with HIV , is a perfect example .
You are talking about when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism , and when , with that in mind , it is a yes when the inter@@ view@@ er asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in un@@ desi@@ ra@@ bles .
First , you use speci@@ ous arguments and then dis@@ credit them with barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Wh@@ enever I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we have to qu@@ e@@ ue behind intoler@@ ant hypo@@ thes@@ es who think that they are all due .
I think it is you who use speci@@ ous arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the c@@ ash@@ -@@ g@@ ates of the right , does not exist practically .
I believe that this is what we call democracy .
So no one would be affected by UK@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
It is only in the parallel uni@@ verse of UK@@ IP that Car@@ s@@ well can appear as a revolutionary .
A quot@@ ation from a tor@@ ch does not provide evidence .
So please draw on the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail has not written the report , it has only been commen@@ ting on it .
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should have been shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality .
I do not think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You know nothing about my personal situation or about my identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
The Far@@ age phrase was a great surprise , but only because we so rarely talk about it .
He made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic remarks .
You will have to put your money where your mouth is .
I am not , of course , where you want to go , but I imagine that you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like .
So rarely do we talk about it because , unlike Far@@ age and That@@ cher ’ s sc@@ attered follow@@ ers who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of go@@ d and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are a good thing , then not .
Finally , the situation in Ireland is as ro@@ tten as in Spain .
With the new crisis that is coming to the end of the austerity period , nothing has been done .
S@@ pec@@ king almost 5 % of growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
In Ireland we have been told by the E@@ T@@ U@@ C , we have been told by the European Union for Europe of the Nations Group .
We have seen what is going on .
It recommended that the article should be read .
At@@ temp@@ ts are being made to make the impression that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that a UN N@@ O@@ U@@ V@@ E M@@ IL@@ O@@ MI@@ MI@@ E is in the process of taking place .
With the agreement of Brussels , which is sha@@ ken by the lowest society in Europe , flexible work on the ground , and which continues to be so .
With these in@@ consisten@@ cies , at the moment , they are pa@@ ving the way for the Polish people to come .
In the 8@@ 0s of the twentieth century , the country ir@@ ic@@ ked it into one of the poorest countries of the European Union , with the Portuguese having to consider a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter without the new@@ com@@ ers , the situation is still better than it was .
The Greek was in front of us .
That their development is not a long quiet river is on the basis of the recent dis@@ d@@ ain .
Is it the lowest in Europe ?
That is not true !
Latvia has an im@@ po@@ t rate of 0 % on companies .
Now there is an hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the sha@@ m paid by the multinationals .
According to a report which came out in 2008 or 2009 , they pay less than 5 % of their gener@@ ics in France .
It is only the SMEs that are paying a great deal of money .
Now I can confirm that road traffic has once again become en@@ demic , and there are new and new cars ( and che@@ at ) all the cor@@ ners of the street , just as before the crisis of 2008 .
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years , and the recovery has been evident in the daily d@@ ust since the return .
Is this supposed to be the economic news ?
Do not worry , I am sure the comments will soon be inf@@ lam@@ ed .
In another article that they are in the process of writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ ha@@ l A@@ stri@@ a is involved in a st@@ oring of the A@@ 140 .
Does R@@ y@@ an@@ air now intend to transfer the passengers from one flight to another in this way ?
I believe that Mr O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft , so a few bul@@ l and bul@@ lets on the old will soon be forgotten .
Having said that , I will vote with it next week , so I hope that it will not be one of these people once again .
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot .
Has R@@ y@@ an@@ air paid extra passengers for the additional fear that they were willing to provide ?
But without this kind of Irish business , you could not allow you to go on holiday , a young man .
I never took R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the three last time I took the plane with B@@ A .
I prefer when the airline offers a good service .
No , but it is R@@ y@@ an@@ air , so they can give us a great deal of joy .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air trigg@@ ers dozens of comments from people who would never take R@@ y@@ an@@ air to those who like to take R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have to attack themselves , and so on .
That is quite transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air is not going to be happy with the extra costs involved in this incident .
I wonder what the delays are and whether it is going to be necessary to compensate passengers and , if so , whether R@@ y@@ an@@ air will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake for air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers at the airport .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers were placed in another plane in less than an hour , and they have no right to any compensation .
S@@ or@@ ry to dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to the British Air@@ ways flight from British Air@@ ways in Syria , not true as you say .
Good vo@@ y@@ age
Last Sunday , in Paris , street street in Frank@@ en@@ gh@@ ur@@ ge@@ is : the Mar@@ is is largely pedestri@@ an , and is literally the world &apos;s group .
People do not come en m@@ asse for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( for the most part ) , nor for the Sal@@ on of the B@@ lan@@ c@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ au ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly du@@ sty ) Sal@@ on .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the shops are all open and that the neigh@@ bor@@ hood is incredibly lively and lively .
With many foreigners who spend ...
Do you believe that the opening up of Sunday will create jobs ?
G@@ ue a Paris R@@ ue R@@ ue from the Bour@@ geo@@ is , where the shops are opened on the Sunday , full of the world with 50 % of tourists .
@ al@@ o@@ es F@@ als !
The only argument that would appear to be admissible is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists , and it is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they are buying the tax .
The tourist areas are losing a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons .
There is the industry where expensive equipment , which is exploited on the Sunday , makes it possible to lower prices .
Sunday as a day of rest is a right that employees , apart from exception , enjoy .
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code .
Neither the Minister responsible for the economy nor , moreover , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , have the slightest authority to reform the Labour Code .
At a time when they are coming to a close .
The law is for what ?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses that want to work on the Sunday .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al , Sunday ap@@ m I take my small children to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my V@@ ille of 30@@ ,000 inhabitants , where I live in France , the municipal bi@@ b@@ li@@ o is open four days a week , but not the one !
That is what access to culture ...
And it is also the regulation of working time .
The lifestyle he defended with ten@@ acity against fascism

And if the succession of his daughter was , against his will , used to pay for the inher@@ it@@ ance costs ?
There are pain@@ tings .
Some are well , others are terrible .
Perhaps his succession would like his share of the ca@@ ke , if you will forgive the expression .
His preference for a victory for the nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole , and also to its well-known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
Nor do I .
But for five years , and only for five years , it has been perfect .
In 19@@ 40 , he held up to the government ’ s other ar@@ dent ar@@ tos who wanted to discuss an “ agreement ” with the Naz@@ is , and he had very sk@@ il@@ fully won .
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy , he united the country in the idea that fighting F@@ as@@ c@@ ists was the only way to win .
The people of the United Kingdom , and of France , and Belgium and , ultimately , the whole world , can say thank you for having had over these five years just over five years , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the hel@@ m and no one else .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
Whether its des@@ c@@ endants sell free market pain@@ ts to collect money from inher@@ it@@ ance costs , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to be able to ad@@ mire one in a mus@@ e@@ um , they get the money to buy it .
It is as simple as that .
But we could use tax money .
No one can deny that , when it was “ the moment of truth , ” Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill ’ s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A revival of the internal market by public works will only serve to promote large companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by avoiding hi@@ ring , as infrastructure y@@ ards are , by definition , not renewable .
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister , they reflect the real bl@@ under : mistrust of dialogue .
Re@@ turn to rec@@ eptive values .
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory .
The weakest of us are not in need !
Either we support its aid , or it has D@@ R@@ ILO in exchange for the services it makes or has made to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H , which I prefer to do with this vision , is in line with this vision .
There is also the donor who is living in the income of his or her property .
There is a need to differenti@@ ate between those who invest in a return when they reti@@ re and the person who lives from their ren@@ ts .
A good or two for a couple to get to the top , vice versa .
The gen@@ i@@ us of the finance is sing@@ ul@@ arly lacking in imagination .
The new deal was a policy of major works , but at a time of major infrastructure defici@@ ency .
Today , in Europe and in France , this is not the case .
Develop@@ ed countries have been side@@ lined .
The need for infrastructure is therefore marginal in no way could a new deal be a solution .
Especially at a time when the issue of de@@ growth is emerging in response to a recession that is only brutal de@@ growth .
You would have been right 30 years ago : more need ( or opportunities ) for dam@@ s , coal mines , motorways ...
But if we want to make the future climate / energy shock less tough , then the need for investment is glar@@ ingly obvious : isolation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transport and storage of energy , etc .
A tax that favours high-@@ income and ru@@ le-@@ making .
Who is in power ?
Ob@@ s@@ well by the s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ es .
Charles Ar@@ th@@ ur is really a run@@ op@@ ian .
Sam@@ sun@@ g ’ s profits are being undermined by i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and his similar competitors .
The introduction in mid-@@ September of higher scre@@ en control for i@@ Ph@@ one 6 and 6 Pl@@ us may have attracted bu@@ yers who would otherwise have bought a Gal@@ ax@@ y .
I tested all these tele@@ phones and decided on L@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a customer , but not for the benefit of Ap@@ ple .
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft put in place this philosophy , we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google , Ap@@ ple , and the optional community .
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development .
In addition , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied with a single manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
For me , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple , because I like their underlying philosophy , and I appreciate design .
Some people do not value design , for them the options , func@@ tionality and price above .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let us stop seeking a better platform .
There is &apos; a better car manufacturer &apos; , not really , they are different , but similar .
I would like to see a flour@@ ishing port@@ able industry with radically different approaches to different people and markets .
It is healthier and must be encouraged .
That is in all our interests .
I am pleased that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that it is not an Ap@@ ple product , even though I have made a different choice .
Most of the people I know have i@@ Ph@@ one .
Our U@@ ph@@ on friends who , according to one of them , are opposed to ideas and not to men ( on the contrary , from Paris to Paris ) could tell us what the author is ( e ) if they fight ideas of the kind and give us the works that they intend to combat .
Or are they just about the kind of work described in the Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te or A@@ qu@@ it Val@@ ue ?
Their sources is Ju@@ de@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I love you , and you are an intelligent and educated person .
I said that on Ju@@ de@@ ith in the Fo@@ us@@ to ve@@ in , referring to Hol@@ ph@@ er@@ ne , a rapprochement that I did not come ( I did not have his vi@@ vac@@ ity ) .
Otherwise , in the &apos; fund &apos; , since you refer it back , I am not interested , and I really do not see where the problem lies : I hoped that you and your friends might get me out of my back@@ war@@ dness , because I am very slow , but I understand ...
@ Jean : Do you recognise that , cul@@ turally , sending Jud@@ ith to Hol@@ ph@@ er@@ ne , this is the case .
Who is afraid of the world ?
But what is the fear of those who are afraid ?
F@@ ur@@ as@@ to and @ us give us some answers .
The first by invo@@ king the Bi@@ ble of the Bi@@ ble , the second by bran@@ ding Ju@@ de@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler as very symbolic tren@@ ch@@ ment .
It is clear how in@@ tim@@ ate these studies affect them .
Of course , we are no longer in the debate on ideas .
That is something else , much deeper .
Have you read , John , that the Mon@@ de has published an article on the need for the@@ ology ?
As for a debate of ideas , I thought it was appropriate to go to sources .
I do not believe that it seems to me to be very rigorous to claim to be fighting ideas from the only way that their critics ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ at@@ z@@ in@@ ger , the inven@@ tor of the Gen@@ e of Gen@@ re or X , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ en , are inven@@ tors of the The@@ ory of Gen@@ re ) .
But a good thing , as I explained to our U@@ ph@@ on friend , is the difference between having an enligh@@ tened opinion and a simple opinion .
I am not , moreover , on the fact that it is understood to be a nu@@ ance .
I have not read Ju@@ de@@ th , the very symbolic tren@@ ch of g@@ or@@ ge , I have confined myself to the &apos; second sex &apos; ( it was more than my time ) which is , I believe , the source of &apos; the source &apos; according to the wishes of L@@ o .
As I watched the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se since M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , I saw red lights when the mo@@ on was shown when the cl@@ ou@@ ds opened .
The sudden on@@ set of the red mo@@ on had its char@@ m and compensated a little for the disappointment that it sometimes had the view blocked by the cl@@ ou@@ ds .
It was p@@ lo@@ y here at F@@ N@@ Q .
Yes , last night ’ s cl@@ oud would really en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ate the Vic@@ tor@@ ia and N@@ S@@ W coast , while most of Australia ’ s rest had a clear time .

But if Labour accepts our unfair budget , then we will get her true col@@ ours as soon as possible .
You are obs@@ essed with it , not ?
I was in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , then , of course , I saw only cl@@ ou@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne also managed to cover himself during the entire week of the ra@@ inf@@ all of the Per@@ sians and almost all of the astr@@ on@@ om@@ ical phenomena of recent years .
I am beginning to think that there is a bad gen@@ i@@ us whose sole aim is to prevent the inhabitants of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything of the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an observatory , even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cor@@ di@@ ill@@ er .
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se because of the cl@@ ou@@ ds over the sub@@ ur@@ bs of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
I am going to put a TA@@ X@@ E on this ec@@ li@@ p@@ se .

There is nothing about stock market and housing speculation .

The article says too much or too little .
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given .
No hy@@ per@@ -@@ text link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made .
Today , on Tuesday 15 October , you will see the results of mirac@@ les : in Spain , exports have been at an all-@@ time low for five years .
In Greece , the stock market is collap@@ sing .
However , it seems to be the case that there are examples to follow .
The reform of the no@@ tar@@ ies would generate a compensation application of the order of EUR 8 billion .
The Ministry of Econom@@ ics tells us that these claims for compensation are unfounded .
What about the failure of the Ministry of the Econom@@ y ?
Will policymakers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the brave attack of no@@ tar@@ ies have the same courage when submitting the bill to the state budget ?
The follow-up in its time .
O@@ k , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ...
@ lo@@ l No the state is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget , because the government ’ s time horizon is theore@@ tically infin@@ ite , while that of the household is confined to its members ’ lif@@ es@@ p@@ an .
In addition , unless public spending is un@@ productive , they contribute to the financing of material and im@@ material investment in the growth of tomorrow &apos;s growth and thus of future revenue .
I have a few points to make .
A regrettable decision .
But remember the sac@@ red o@@ ath of Hi@@ p@@ po@@ crates : the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first .
Jo@@ lie theory of con@@ spir@@ acy .
Unfortunately , the truth is not your fant@@ asy .
The medical staff would like to use it , but they have the hands of the law as written by politicians .
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions rather than risky sur@@ ger@@ y , safe s@@ lots for drug addic@@ ts rather than having them on the streets , and so on .
On these questions , politicians want to please the m@@ asses inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ated .
In fact , doctors do not earn money with medicines .
That is why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors do not earn money from medicines that the Liberals want our health system to resemb@@ le that of the United States , you should find out how it works .
Do@@ c@@ tors around the world are being cour@@ ted in the same way , but they are more or less visible .
It may have been wrong to put the blame on all of them , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to corporate profits and research .
So read the few reports on our spending on P@@ harm@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ ed@@ its Sch@@ em@@ e and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ing the world prices of medicines everywhere , as well as the differences between countries on what is on sale or only on prescri@@ ption .
This is strengthening this is a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific process , direct or indirect .
In fact , some companies are currently carrying out tests on mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ ations against on@@ co@@ logical pain , despite the laws that hinder them and the on@@ erous permitted permits .
Although the manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy to use alternatives such as mari@@ ju@@ ana , those who reach a version offering good quality products to known do@@ ses will benefit greatly .
S@@ or@@ ry to tell you , but you are wrong , a lot of things are going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharm@@ acies .
As for the hospital , they were happy to use it until someone put the chi@@ p to the hospital .
We cannot have D@@ E@@ T@@ EN@@ R patents on the grass ...
If &apos; researchers &apos; in social sciences were doing research instead of politics and net@@ working , they could be used .
A resear@@ cher investigating , he does not compare one fact to another .
To do so is not to seek .
Com@@ par@@ ing is not about educ@@ ating research .
We cannot say ‘ research is the end of the story ’ , and then , on the same j@@ et , ‘ we have to experiment with everything ’ .
If your research is successful , why do you experience it ?
If your research is not the end of your research , why do you ask you to apply them ?
Can I explain to me how a “ resear@@ cher ” can deduc@@ t that a pup@@ il who cannot as@@ simil@@ ate mathema@@ tics alone could equ@@ ate mathema@@ tics with other matters more easily ?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on condition that pupils learn to use new technologies , but how would they manage to learn new technologies if they don ’ t know how to learn ?
The tests are merely an indicator that makes it possible for us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us .
What is the point of building an indicator that in@@ forms you of what suits you , a desire for self-@@ promotion , a dec@@ e@@ it ?
There is only one aven@@ ue to train teachers : to move away from training the sophis@@ ts and ideolo@@ gues , and to teach practi@@ tioners to practi@@ tioners .
Let us read the paragraph on tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hi@@ ps ( which unfortunately is not very well argued ) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most in@@ effec@@ tual conser@@ va@@ tism : ‘ it is a de@@ vice that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of existing practices , which does not allow the system to be moved forward .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , one cannot hope that only practi@@ tioners teach practi@@ tioners , even if they have their place in modern teachers ’ training .
Education the@@ or@@ ists must have no place .
The practi@@ tioners must have one .
Would you like to be operated on by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and which has never set foot in an operational block ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system .
To give education the@@ or@@ ists more weight would be to destroy it once and for all .
Your analo@@ gy is completely cra@@ zy : if I do not wish to be operated by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has only theoretical training , I would like to make even less use of a sur@@ ge@@ on which has no theoretical training and who has learned on the whole .
Mi@@ hail We@@ a@@ ther@@ ley , the Conservative MEP for the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why does Cameron not say , quite simply , to stop ?
Some@@ one should arrest popular arrest .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
If one day I feel guilty of violating copyright , I will have to read an article like this .
In an information economy , the violation of copyright = flight .
That is the same thing as they have to name their sources correctly .
In many cases , obtaining a licence does not cost anything .
No , it is a violation of copyright .
Not the same thing .
By using content without having the right licence , you are depriving artists of their livelihood .
You can always talk about ped@@ an@@ tic assumptions - but it is about rob@@ ber@@ y .
And you can say as much as you like , but that will not be true .
This is a violation of copyright .
G@@ o and say again .
If one day , I feel guilty of violating copyright , I am beginning to feel guilty of violating copyright .
Obviously , it does not bo@@ de well for you to deprive artists of their income .
If they believe that they should receive money for pictures used in school duties , an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be , then I am happy to deprive them of this shadow income .
lesson No 1 should be to show how , if children themselves create anything and publish it on their fav@@ our@@ ite social networks , they abandon all intellectual property at the site under the general conditions that they have passed from a c@@ lic@@ k .
Perhaps if they share the head@@ phones of their 2@@ 3@@ r@@ d bal@@ lo@@ on with a cop@@ ier on the school bus , they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way .
If we could export this resource that we are full of , the r@@ ally who says that everything is going wrong ..@@ .@@ .

I have 2 children and when they are of choice , I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then .
France pul@@ ls people down by constantly assisting them .
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created .
What is pul@@ ling France down is speeches like yours .
I have always been a private company in private enterprise .
I have had C@@ H@@ A@@ N@@ CE for working in companies run by excellent entrepreneurs : it exists in France , but it is rare .
I am sal@@ u@@ ted because I know that I do not have the skills to lead a company , and that choice enables me to sho@@ ot the nu@@ ts that I frequently meet .
In my water@@ shed , I fully share the post of Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ j@@ ju@@ z@@ an : he says the horri@@ ble truth !
If we compare with German companies that French entrepreneurs are constantly quoting to demand reforms in France , in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric in order to make it competitive , particularly by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French bos@@ ses waiting for in order to do so ? ? ?
Let the state hold its hand to them ?
What is the state that they are acc@@ using of their in@@ competence ?
@ Jacques L@@ .
All the same , this f@@ low@@ ed number of business leaders on your part !
Rem@@ ember , what has you created as a job , as an added value , to be so severe ?
@ P@@ at I understand your reaction .
In fact , France is facing an in@@ solu@@ ble problem : the in@@ competence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs , and who move and min@@ t while waiting for permanent state assistance !
This is terrible !
But they have solutions : the abolition of the Lab@@ or code , employers &apos; burdens , taxes , work 4@@ 5@@ h / week paid for 35 , and some , who walk on eggs , dare to call for wages to be cut if they do not do so !
I look forward to all the negative comments on this subject .
What is ironic is how people always complain about the F@@ ir@@ st Group .
From my point of view , L@@ as@@ t was not really an investment for us taxpayers .
They have tried to stay af@@ lo@@ at rather than transform .
It does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since L@@ as@@ t is dealing with it .
But they also improved with their predecessors , including British R@@ ail .
Unfortunately , we do not have the power to do this , unfortunately .
I tried to have them recently , but I did not succeed .
But L@@ ab@@ our is going to get us into trouble , is it not ...
It is an international subsidiary .
They already operate in Germany .
There is nothing to prevent people in the United Kingdom creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in inv@@ itations to tender .
But it seems that we are not very good in management , and most of our priv@@ ati@@ sed services end up being managed by a foreign operator .
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when it won the Vir@@ g@@ in contract , all so that the decision was finally cancelled .
And there is better : M@@ R@@ R , a company in Hong Kong has won the contract for the growth of the C@@ R@@ T for eight years .
Well , Labour , as they told us during the referendum campaign , is fully in favour of po@@ oling and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across the borders .
It may therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision . )
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on the right track when that of the British is not .
What S@@ co@@ t@@ R@@ ail needs is not just a change of owner but , above all , new ideas .
A@@ bel@@ li@@ o is perhaps the worst possible choice , but the real problem is the ridiculous system of fran@@ ch@@ ise , not the individual .
&apos;@@ He was a be@@ ating gir@@ l &apos; .
I was not happy , but I really was ha@@ ven by this kind of expression .
As@@ sum@@ ing that being &apos; be@@ ating &apos; is superior to many others , concern for others , intelligence , listening , for example , being &apos; be@@ ating &apos; has nothing to do with the survival of a disease : &apos; beat &apos; canc@@ ers , which are no less so . I know of some people who have died .
B@@ rea@@ king off a disease has nothing to do with merit .
G@@ o on again .
I say to you not that it is a condition for ger@@ r , I say to you .
Nothing has been done with any merit ... !
When the examples of your life , there are only you to judge them .
I would like to start again .
It is simply mon@@ str@@ ous to in@@ sti@@ l , if only for a moment , that we can have merit in getting out of a disease or not getting out of it , is simply mon@@ str@@ ous .
The body follows or does not follow .
A cowar@@ dly body , from everywhere , despite the will , despite the confidence in medicine , you have a vague idea of what C ?
If we do not think otherwise , if there is no doubt that having a strong mor@@ ale will make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it , then try to seek experimental treatments , as this woman did , not to refuse them out of fear .
Some@@ one who is in medicine is first and foremost someone who tru@@ sts medicine .
But if one pref@@ ers to rely on the &quot; l@@ ord &quot; is something else .
Neither the deserved merit nor the courage .
These considerations are unique to mor@@ alists .
When you catch a sal@@ t , a real , you will put you to the point of only becoming a z@@ om@@ bi@@ e .
Personally , I have caught two of them , the sal@@ th , the large ones , and if I have been &apos; beaten up &apos; as these psycho@@ log@@ ists are saying , I have completely escap@@ ed that .
Unless this fight is to close the te@@ eth , to suffer hell , and to collect the sho@@ ts .
I thought that the indic@@ tment against Milosevic was decided and finalised ten years ago .
I have not seen this name in the newspapers since at least that time .
What is happening ?
It is an anniversary .
A forgotten anniversary .
His trial was conducted “ quickly ” and then swept under the car@@ pet .
Is this the story that was told at the time ?
The communist who became a nationalist that unle@@ ashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade ?
Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ?
So please ask what has been deliberately left behind : 1 .
How can NATO bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment be legal under the international law of L@@ A M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ R@@ E ?
Which country did Serbia attack ?
With regard to R@@ DR@@ s ( Rad@@ o-@@ Tele@@ visi@@ on-@@ Ser@@ bi@@ a ) , why do you not mention that NATO has destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then seen it as a valid target .
Milosevic had no way of doing this : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , he would be cru@@ ci@@ fied as a tra@@ itor .
And if he defended him , he would be sw@@ am@@ ped by the Western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
The West used a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en to post part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally declared its independence and was virtually recognised by the Western states that subsequently li@@ ed about the situation on the ground .
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , died politically after his first term of office for failing to understand the situation that had developed .
Z@@ or@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time .
In the end , the Guar@@ dian should not call Milosevic a ty@@ rant ( even if we did not like it ) .
To my knowledge , it is only in Greece that there is a method of predic@@ ting earthquakes , measuring the pi@@ dest@@ -@@ electric level in the quar@@ tz .
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results .
So there is hope , but caution has nothing to do with that of the ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et named HA@@ T@@ -@@ P-@@ 1@@ 1@@ b , located around 1@@ 24 light years of the Earth in the C@@ y@@ na@@ us con@@ st@@ ellation , ‘ the smallest and most col@@ our@@ ful planet to present De@@ tec@@ table water m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules ‘ , according to a study carried out by the D@@ rak@@ e D@@ ing and J@@ on@@ a@@ than F@@ ra@@ ine team of the University of Mar@@ y@@ land .
So we have a great deal to do .
Just like those that make animals feel a threat .
Thank you very much for the science to regulate the experimental pro@@ w@@ ess that is being carried out in the world .
How would animals be j@@ um@@ ped ( in advance ) ?
Perhaps through the perception of other elements , the rate of which is changing in the case of earthquake .
Like the ra@@ don , for example .
A pri@@ ori is a od@@ our@@ less gas for man , but it may be found by the animals .
All these methods are in@@ tec@@ table for man , but not for the measuring instruments that he has .
We do not have a reliable result on these courses of action ...
It has been observed many times ( and for centuries ) that some animals are acting strange in a few hours with an earthquake , including h@@ ens , cows , dogs and , above all , s@@ na@@ kes .
I had seen a report on the fight by two scientific teams , the Califor@@ n@@ ian , the other Japanese , in order to acknowledge the validity of their work , which related to the sensitivity of animals to land mag@@ netic fields , and in particular to their modification before se@@ is@@ ers .
So I am not a scientific , but their assumptions have convinced me !
Or is this research ?
Why do we have so much contempt for this course of action ?
We should learn to listen to nature ...
If you look at things cal@@ m@@ ly and rigorously , it is published in a serious jour@@ nal , and no one is mis@@ led .
As soon as we talk about the animals ’ ‘ signs ’ , the same is true : everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the red fish was stran@@ ded in circles .
I cannot understand why you might think that Bor@@ is would be a good leader for the Conservatives .
He has done too much as a may@@ or of London .
When you listen to the L@@ BC programme , one cannot help but think that this man knows nothing and always tries to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate with a jo@@ ke .
It never directly answers anything .
He also said that he was in agreement with Far@@ age , then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari , the presen@@ ter , asked him about what .
He could not appoint just one point .
He made so many promises to be elected as may@@ or and he did not have one .
It merely underlines the extent to which the rest of the Conservative Party is only a ra@@ g@@ ba@@ g of mer@@ ch@@ ant , no ?
Because it is popular .
Because it is fun@@ ny .
He was in &apos; H@@ a@@ ve I Go@@ s Ne@@ ws &apos; .
Because it is a celebr@@ ity and people have been charged with the ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tions of cele@@ bri@@ ties .
Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him , and the same applies to the rest of the country .
When ( and not if ) he takes the party ’ s leadership , I am sure that the popularity ratings of the T@@ ories will go back to the ca@@ p .
May God help us .
I am not so sure : people like jo@@ kes , but do not want their prime minister to be one of them .
That is what Lon@@ don@@ ers were saying .
He should have brought his friend , with him , a cle@@ ver , cle@@ ver way forward with him .
In many respects , I think it is trying to copy R

Good evening I think that the red b@@ oun@@ ce against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brit@@ t@@ any and the City of Br@@ rest .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote our taxes to the dreams of a few ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rers who are as nice as they might be .
Are there players in the current Serbian training of Koso@@ van origin ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , once in the Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now in the Hen@@ er@@ ba@@ ha@@ e , are from Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I do not know whether they are still in the team .
It is Bis@@ ev@@ a@@ c &apos;s defen@@ der of L@@ y@@ on , not B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic was the middle ground or before in the 1970s and 1980s and led to many teams in Greece , but I do not know where he is .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic is Mo@@ star , Bosnia-Herzegovina , and was the attack on the great team of Vel@@ ez , who , under the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary Su@@ le@@ man Re@@ ba@@ c , ended twice second place in the Yugosla@@ vian le@@ ague ( and also with V@@ a@@ hi@@ d H@@ Al@@ s@@ è@@ d@@ z@@ ic and the faithful match of Ar@@ s@@ è@@ ne W@@ eng@@ er , Bor@@ o Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c .

I cannot help you here .
I know that he lost his place when Con@@ te came , then he went to Men@@ er , and as far as I know he is not the holder of it .
Perhaps he can do something about it , perhaps in the Indian Pre@@ mi@@ er League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Ser@@ iously , Albania is not afraid .
You should love Albania because you are neighbours .
The tr@@ ick is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of today &apos;s real Albania .
Ap@@ parently it was the flag of the Greater Albania which encomp@@ asses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
There is a bit of excessive nationalism , in fact .
Fortunately , there has not been too much damage ( as far as I am aware ) .
In fact , it was an Albanian flag with the map not for what is known as the Greater Albania , but for Albania before 19@@ 13 , when the major European powers decided to give the bu@@ ts from the country to neighbouring countries .
How can we have felt &apos; an explosion of joy &apos; by seeing two tow@@ ers collap@@ sing in the knowledge that women , men and people who are un@@ sure of children are inside ?
How ?
What bo@@ thers me a little in this &apos; testi@@ mony &apos; is that the only fact that , if only once , it was able to rejo@@ ice spontane@@ ously of the horrific death of thousands of people , testi@@ fies , in my view , to a &apos; line line &apos; , all of whose &apos; testi@@ monies &apos; should be taken with the greatest possible caution . I would like to make a comment .
Perhaps in the short term &apos; joy &apos; , we will not have thought about the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted .
We will have just thought , for a moment , that , for once , Muslims had managed to really and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tically hurt the great vil@@ la@@ in S@@ at@@ an in his very heart .
To do so is a powerful “ Q@@ q@@ ch . ”
It is gr@@ an@@ di@@ ose .
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been ero@@ ded by their sense of humiliation .
With fil@@ med testi@@ monies in Palestine .
C@@ l@@ assi@@ que S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ ude .
There was some doubt about that .
The &quot; Christian / white &quot; West cannot measure the degree of che@@ ating , anger , hatred of the mu@@ d , when it weather the he@@ f@@ ty misery , social and cultural under@@ development of the Arab Muslim world .
I am talking about the Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers sub@@ ur@@ bs , not the Du@@ ba@@ i tow@@ ers .
The past s@@ cri@@ pt , certainly mag@@ ni@@ fied , is not cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How can we get the Muslim world out of this di@@ abol@@ ical fun@@ nel ?
T@@ ot@@ ally in step , two major po@@ ols are ir@@ rig@@ ating the Arab world : bi@@ go@@ try powers in power and fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common position , the freezing of thought and ex@@ communications ( f@@ res@@ h@@ ness or army ) of its critical expression .
Let us have understood this before , we must not force the Muslims back on their feet .
That is the only way .
Has Ed@@ y Pl@@ us read this article ?
I suppose that is true in many countries .
In Britain , however , the autumn marks the beginning of six long , dark , we@@ t@@ ish and de@@ pressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people .
In addition , everyone falls ill .
This is seasonal pressure .
I am suffering from this myself .
When there is light , it becomes hell for me and for those like me .
A do@@ se of vitam@@ in D should help a little for the mood and well-being .
The autumn is beautiful in Britain , with or without rain .
The campaign in particular is brea@@ th@@ taking in the autumn .
Not as much at the same time as the summer green when everything is living instead of being on the ver@@ ge of dying .
In Britain , if you are lucky , the summer falls a weekend .
We have had a good summer in this year and do not do your bit , which re@@ sto@@ res c@@ lic@@ h@@ és !
Not everyone .
I am rarely sick in winter .
But now I am reti@@ ring and I am not going to develop immunity for the ger@@ ms of the outside , that may change , I suppose .
It is not about to die , it is just one step in a cycle ...
A mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous step with en@@ ra@@ ged sm@@ ell@@ s , with a fe@@ tish that culmin@@ ates with cele@@ bra@@ tions like H@@ all@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , din@@ ner risks full of other wonderful words .
We need not stop doing things !
These are my recommendations for the f@@ es@@ tive f@@ es@@ ti@@ val .
Yes , these dark and grey months are making me much happ@@ ier and more rela@@ xed .
In the case of the taxation of children , it is the state that comes mainly from the 8 to 10 countries .
But , with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the dec@@ im@@ als 4 and 5 that are affected ( medi@@ an income ) according to grap@@ es 2 .
The deletion of the half part , above all , as regards wid@@ ows , is not dealt with at all in the article , or rather its impact is con@@ scienti@@ ously assessed : EUR 2@@ 30@@ M of euros is a jo@@ ke which does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is in@@ dol@@ ate .
And that is not the right thing to do .
Well , we are not on the do@@ le of stra@@ w , it is true .
For once , we are not going to m@@ our@@ n a policy that is on the right side of the House .
It is obvious that those of the richest 20 % have to bear more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let us continue with this , and you will encourage this 20 % to work or leave .
Well , I know it is not politically correct , but I say it all the same .
L@@ ong live Tro@@ ries and O@@ IC@@ s recyc@@ led to the PS : they understood everything .
You do not see what you are looking at .
The proportion is still the same , here or in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population holds 80 % of the wealth .
A fair tax is when it forbi@@ ds anyone to am@@ ass as much as it can .
Over and above a certain amount of money , it loses all its usefulness .
And , once more than the usefulness of money , the money is no longer used only to make money , it is ) to say to make the greatest number of people .
We are among the richest 20 % .
There is no doubt that the 20 % of households that work most ( and create the wealth of which part of it is logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of part of their efforts .
Or , at the same time , let us give up and live with the minimum social conditions , especially if we have social housing .
Fortunately , the ut@@ op@@ i@@ as of the cutting edge in the Kh@@ mer Rou@@ ge have lived .

A@@ h , 6@@ th too late .
I love Air@@ b@@ n@@ b .
&apos;@@ It is very dangerous and highly risky &apos; is not true .
You have really missed a good chance .
According to the link provided in the article :
In his discharge , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to T@@ em@@ an was quick , almost absurd .
Within 24 hours , according to an e-mail supplied to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b sent a ser@@ ge@@ er to change the greenh@@ ouses , made arrangements to spend a week at ho@@ tel ho@@ tel , and transferred $ 23 8@@ 17 ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b is in@@ sured , but Even so ) .
So why is this article quoting T@@ em@@ an complaining that he has received no support from Air@@ b@@ n@@ b ?
W@@ OR@@ E A@@ I@@ R@@ B@@ N@@ B , to receive as well as travel
I am looking for people who have already used the air b@@ b just to reassure me .

I am sure that this will please the families and close to the thousands of Kurds who died at hal@@ ab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends have succum@@ bed to something other than the chemical bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ments of H@@ app@@ y sad@@ ness .
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author , your comment is un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly ( to remain pol@@ ite ) .
Moreover , how would this mass crime in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
It is not hy@@ per@@ -@@ sk@@ inned : ‘ in search of weapons of mass destruction .
We are in agreement .
You believe that this is the time to weaken the army in order to strengthen education .
This is never the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively : it is TO@@ U@@ J@@ O@@ UR@@ S that is the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war ?
There would already be a great deal more education if you ‘ ’ were ‘ ’ to work 35 hours instead of 17 hours .
At the moment , our teachers earn more than engineers .
And let us not pretend that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme .
But that is not the case , because National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college / ly@@ ric@@ s to its pro@@ s .
A kind of , in short , enforced tele@@ working , except that the employer pays neither the computer , nor the Internet connection , nor supplies .
In fact , it is so much the floor at 17@@ .@@ 00 a week and 4 months of holiday that the CA@@ P@@ S of me@@ a@@ hs , come , you are waiting for you .
How , then , do you have no desire to col@@ late mis@@ educated chi@@ gg@@ ers whose parents are sp@@ ur@@ ring you on them when you deal with them ?
I believe that the priority in this area is to dis@@ arm ji@@ ha@@ d@@ is so that the k@@ hur@@ ry population can flourish better .
Where it can be seen that the Bush administration has done everything in its own right .
My first job was in the sale , in London , of three times nothing , and yet that was a job for which a diplom@@ a was needed .
One year on , I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London underground , it was GBP 5 000 more per year and you were not even asking for the patent .
I have never regret@@ ted .
In this respect , do not worry if you do not find a gradu@@ ate job , try to find something that pays , or that you like to do .
If I had stay@@ ed with the jobs that were gradu@@ ated , I would still be paying my student loan .
I do not like doing business so much , so I hope in the long run to be in the civil service either in the academic world .
Mr L@@ O@@ L L@@ O@@ L , this article really comes late !
Ex@@ ac@@ tly , when I obtained my qualification in 2011 , there was already a three-year back@@ lo@@ g .
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed gradu@@ ates ?
To get rid of the &apos; b@@ is@@ ou@@ gh@@ s &apos; as art / letters / theat@@ re / theat@@ re / political philosophy / philosophy / political sciences is what is known as the &apos; unemployed &apos; diplomas .
I have one of these diplomas and I have ended up as the production director .
It turned out that the important thing was not the diplom@@ a , but , as the article says , a good career path , starting at school and throughout university .
Of course , the starting wage was lower , but we are rapidly clim@@ bing the lad@@ der , because in the real world , what counts is more than knowledge .
This is an engineering / artistic debate that has been going on for years .
Scienti@@ sts cannot solve all the problems , it is more important to be able to stand up in the morning , to get to work and to inter@@ act with people in order to achieve results .
Le@@ t@@ ters , philosophy and art are b@@ is@@ cu@@ it sectors ?
That is ridiculous .
I assume that you are talking about diplomas study in the media , or whatever you look at where you have gone .
Le@@ t@@ ters , philosophy , political science , and art are true channels .
We need people who can explain the major issues to school students , who understand the importance of the foundations of culture , such as literature , art , etc . , and highlight them .
It would not be better to have a real territorial policy in order to dis@@ congestion Paris and boost the rest of France .

A number of secure par@@ ks that are closed down and closed down , as already exists in the cities of northern Europe , in Di@@ j@@ on or L@@ y@@ on , will be inst@@ alled in the ve@@ ts .
Good idea .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ alised by the 2@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , it is hoped that the V@@ ille of Paris is working with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark .
They have a lot of experience in this area .
Well , no place has been found for U@@ N S@@ U@@ L .
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ and Del@@ ano@@ e … .
Well , it is not at all .
When we talk with pedestri@@ ans and other users of transport by the reasons why they do not ped@@ dle it , I believe that the main reasons are : 1 / c is hy@@ per@@ -@@ dangerous with all of these b@@ ars , lorries , and the sco@@ o@@ ters that drive quickly and are f@@ ob@@ bed off . The survival of bic@@ yc@@ les 2 / one is full of pollution in my head for cycle paths , and the need to reduce car traffic ( urban type toll charges ) , reduce the speed ( Paris = 30 area ) , ensure compliance with the road code by systematically complying ( even the bic@@ yc@@ les ) ( even the bic@@ yc@@ les ) ( even the bic@@ yc@@ les ) . Be@@ g@@ inning with the be@@ ref@@ t that we need to adapt the written road code for a hundred years ago to bic@@ yc@@ les , to gener@@ alise bu@@ ff@@ er zones after the c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine pass@@ ages , not before , if not b@@ agno@@ le , and sco@@ o@@ ters are not getting bo@@ gged down .
The cycle of cycle paths is apar@@ theid , it is necessary to co@@ exist but to re@@ balance the occupation of the urban area .
What about bic@@ yc@@ les in the big Paris ?
Not a word on the place of bic@@ yc@@ les in public transport ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .

Before rac@@ ke@@ te@@ ering begins , it would be better to find who really is behind this massacre .
It is not Russia .
There is no certainty that the way the world is developing is like the way in which the world is evolving .
It looks horrific .
My children are not a financial asset .
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the matter to the EC@@ HR , but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been lod@@ ged .
In addition , they would have to lo@@ dge a complaint in Germany or Ukraine first .
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the subsequent criminal investigation .
O@@ ut@@ side , but Libya has not explo@@ red P@@ an A@@ m 103 either .
Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a Air@@ lines is not mis@@ ta@@ k@@ enly the fault of the airspace safety authority , in this case the Ukrainian Government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had previously been slaughtered , Ukraine launched air attacks on the rebels , and any aircraft could , of course , be regarded as a possible and immediate threat .
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat , or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay for over@@ flight rights ?
Where are all the pro-@@ Ki@@ ev tro@@ ll@@ ers who defend their u@@ sur@@ ped government / ul@@ tran@@ ation@@ alists in the West of the West - and who want to demonstrate as much as possible that Putin has shot the M@@ H@@ 17 the@@ ft .
As far as I am aware , there is already a complaint against the government in Ki@@ ev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sk@@ ies .
The precedent : a 1986 ruling of the International Court of Justice , which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Con@@ tra@@ ys in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions .
There is no chance that Russia will leave this case to the IC@@ J .
It is fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t wants to tell Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia .
I hope that he can present evidence to support his allegations .
So far , the investig@@ ators have not said anything like this .
To call Ric@@ ardo and be like such a y@@ o@@ tian as an ec@@ o , is dist@@ ressing !
To call Pol@@ ar is to lose the north is rejo@@ ic@@ ing .
Just one question from y@@ o@@ tian : is today ’ s poor poor poorer than yesterday ’ s poor ?
I can only point out that those who are most critical of the p@@ ound Pi@@ ke@@ tty &apos; s book have not read it !
It is easy to read , I took a few days .
It shows the statistical evolution of res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , res@@ titu@@ tion , unequal concentration , inequality of labor income , the property of capital , merit , and inher@@ it@@ ance in the lo@@ g .
It shows that today &apos;s concentration of capital coinci@@ des with the beginning of 20 ° before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital , from 19@@ 14 to 1945 , and then the concentration resumed after ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ ju@@ z@@ an : you do not know what .
I ask you how long it has taken you to read this , knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has a few limits .
Secondly , the question is not whether it is easy to read .
The question is whether the central thesis that the press has given is right or not .
If it is right , it can be debated without having read the book , the most important of which is a one-@@ way argument in favour .
No , it is easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ ju@@ z@@ an : how long did you have to read it ?
Is the central theory of the press sum@@ med up by the press wrong ?
I have not read and will not read it .
I am therefore relying on the summary of his central thesis , and that is what I believe to be a jo@@ ke .
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Has humanity not generally enriched itself ?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ f@@ z@@ ai is an impressive personality and certainly deserves the price .
But remember that it is only 17 years old .
An age to which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world .
I hope that this price will not be a burden on the young gir@@ l and that she will find her way to a happy life .
The problem is not the price , but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old ad@@ age that col@@ our@@ ful per@@ ver@@ ts are the embo@@ di@@ ment of evil .
I wish you happiness in Mal@@ ala , but she must realise that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else – not even in Britain ’ s popular neigh@@ bor@@ hoods !
Some@@ one thought his speech was a little strange .
She than@@ ked her father for giving him a great deal of freedom but mentioned that , if she were not where she is now , she would have been married to 14 years .
Is it not the case that Mal@@ ala itself is part of these &apos; col@@ our@@ ings &apos; ?
You should not have an &apos; an@@ ten@@ na &apos; on this site .
You yourself are a dreadful perverse .
It is absolutely revol@@ ting .
No , his father was not going to mar@@ ry her to 14 years .
She was 15 years old .
His father runs a school in which girls are in school and is in favour of equal rights for women .
It is , and has always been , for it to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide for itself of its marriage .
For all that , it is someone who is unusual in Pakistan , because he believes that women are equal to men .
What she said was that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 , without having a say .
S@@ or@@ ry that she did not say it eloqu@@ ently for you .
This may seem contradictory , but perhaps she would say that , if her father had not given him freedom , she would have been married to 14 years .
Instead of the entry into the 4 season , and particularly by J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , it is difficult to find his own s@@ ister of Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ tr@@ ich .
I have just looked at the two seas@@ ons that are quite different , but I have to admit that it is one of the best , one of the most successful , horror stories .
A first fascin@@ ating episo@@ de .
The achievement is close to perfec@@ tion , and the show of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange sing the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on M@@ ars in Bo@@ y is quite simply top@@ pling .
I have not yet looked at this new season ( which will be the last for me , without beef beef ) .
In the case of American H@@ or@@ ar C@@ or@@ ary , I would have preferred to have looked at 13 episo@@ des of 3 to 4 months .
One thing , however , is that , apart from Ex@@ tra@@ ordinary J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , it is , above all , the risks of scenes and mountains that find me .
There was an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans in A@@ H@@ S , which makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of today ’ s san@@ i@@ tisation of today ’ s produc@@ tions .
It escap@@ ed me a little from you that you would throw you out in advance for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting to be able to carry the quality .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange is certainly a pillar of this package , but you say so well , there are many more things .
No , it is quite simply that , for me , J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ( and , above all , his way and the way she uses it ) is really U@@ .@@ N@@ . P@@ ill@@ ar of the series outside the technical qualities .
I am very much looking to her for good .
Then I find that the series is written in writing , it wants to do too much at the same time .
season 3 was slightly below that , in the 2 that was too dis@@ per@@ sed , despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I do not see them at 10 seas@@ ons from American H@@ or@@ ar St@@ ory or it is going to end up as 24 hours chron@@ ically what .
But everyone is doing what they want !
It is by what I say ‘ then I shall not look later ’ that everyone is obliged to do the same !
I simply share my point of view , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , J@@ E , believes that it will be fatal .
But then that is my opinion .
Let us talk about less tax hi@@ kes , please - let us rather pay in state expenditure .
No , let us increase spending .
Those who wanted to cut spending have failed .
Deb@@ ating po@@ le@@ m@@ ics over relatively small items of spending , such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to want , and for all this time some of us , in both sides , pretend that these nu@@ ances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see their game and find them out of their own . This is bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of expenditure .
Deb@@ t is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country .
&quot; Deb@@ t &quot; is nothing to worry about .
I would see no problem with the government ne@@ aring a third of my income ( even before talking about consumer taxes ) if I thought it was going to make good use of it .
But that is not the case , and many taxpayers have the same feeling .
It is said that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age has not been entirely honest about how to cut taxes , but how good it is , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development aid , Hi@@ gh Spe@@ ed 2 , about ne@@ edless wind subsidies and nuclear power stations that are twice as expensive as they are . You should arrive at a figure that makes the tax of L@@ ab@@ our and Li@@ br@@ -@@ De@@ m a very lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous figure on the most lux@@ uri@@ ous homes .
The first £ 10 000 is not tax@@ able .
This means that someone who ear@@ ns £ 3@@ 3@@ ,000 a year will pay approximately £ 5 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone with £ 50 000 would pay around £ 10 000 ( a fifth ) , and someone with £ 200 000 pays about £ 7@@ 0@@ ,000 ( slightly more than a third ) .
And social security contributions ?
The more social contributions , the more local taxes , the more par@@ king fees and the car stic@@ ker , and it is before VAT .
Almost exactly 30 % of my money is levi@@ ed at source before local taxes and the car stic@@ ker .
I am paid in a decent way , but not in an extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant way .
Not that this is a problem , of course , I am happy to pay my taxes .
But let us not pretend to believe that money is coming from the sky , or that it is not important to know where billions of p@@ ounds are spent .
How can an unemployed person looking for work prove it ?
Even if 20 % of the unemployed were not seeking , this means that 80 % are looking for and not finding .
Since I am an unemployed person , I am more interested in what the others are seeking or not ?
For a potential recru@@ it@@ er to receive 10 or 20 C@@ V@@ s , this bo@@ des my chances all the same .
Indeed , I have not had any news of the Po@@ le Employment for months ; that means that the agents are more busy carrying out checks than they really are going to get back from job announ@@ cements .
I do not see the interest .
Because it is not up to the state to provide work .
If Po@@ le Employment does not provide enough posts , then Po@@ le Employment must be dispen@@ sed with .
What is a sensitive subject ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case ensuring that the unemployed do their homework in return for their rights .
Just as a contro@@ ller asks for their transport title for users of a means of transport , a service Head or employees of their work , etc .
Nobody is cr@@ ying out for scandal in these cases , no ?
It is indeed worth pointing out that the unemployed have rights : the only two times I have had to deal with office in office , my rights at the ARE have been poorly established , and on one of the dossiers , cut by 40 % , it has had to be fought hard .
It takes time !
I am not an expert in law .
P@@ iling up and monitoring is taking over , while it is close to being an insurance company , as a matter of fact .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees , it is the employees who pay for it .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans and French non-@@ employees are giving themselves rights that they have not , in fact , been able to do !
That is not normal .
I would add that dignified unemployment insurance is a contribution to the enhan@@ cement of paid work .
More than waiting for mur@@ der@@ ous tw@@ e@@ ets in Arab@@ ic ...
In fact , there is a need to have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop coming to an end so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would thus resemb@@ le the spread of the black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with war and population movements at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is had the mind to ban H@@ ad@@ j in M@@ ec@@ ca this year on Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms from the three countries affected .
El Pa@@ is reports that 7 400 have seen their visa request refused due to their country of origin or their recent journeys .
In fact , there was a pil@@ gri@@ m from Bosnia who contr@@ acted M@@ ec@@ ca in M@@ ec@@ ca during the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980 ’ s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m from Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same spirit of mind .
Is it un@@ hear@@ ty to propose that the sick people of E@@ bol@@ a should be prevented from taking an aeroplan@@ e for Europe ?
I thought it was just common sense , but apparently those &apos; who know &apos; have decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people ...
These countries in West Africa where E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be forced into quar@@ ant@@ ine .
No one is going .
Only health workers can enter .
21 waiting days after having treated patients before they could leave .
If they contract the E@@ bol@@ a virus while they are there , they stay there until they are heal@@ ed .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Last week alone , people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa , although they took &apos; all the necessary precautions &apos; .
This disease can be stopped .
It is spreading mainly by the airlines .
Let us ban them from being able to fly to these countries .
In addition , customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical symptoms of E@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be put in quar@@ ant@@ ine immediately .
Let him get the message from the first and the group ( including religious ones ) second , and he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt whether he will be able to set in the dogma the image of God characterised by the total functioning of the world &apos;s cor@@ tex .
It is still a long way from that view .
It is only 20 years since information appeared like the premium given to humanity , while religion emerged from the brain leading our actions since Lu@@ c@@ y perhaps .
What is the point of becoming yet another Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who did not notice , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely a minority in France today , no one is forced to join .
Those who critici@@ ze the Church in any case would not , in any case , see the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France .
What is the next step , what is being removed from the concept of sin , too &apos; anxiety &apos; ?
@ ren@@ se : S@@ or@@ ry does not have a vision limited to France .
And in the world , it may be this that will make it possible to reach more people ...
@ Mar@@ ine E , to be honest ( as usual ) the respect of others as you envisage him .
H@@ ill@@ el a century before he said : &apos; Not to others what you do not want you to do , it is all the Tor@@ ah and the rest is just a comment ! &apos; .
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity , but introduces it .
Your &apos; progress towards justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity &apos; but without go@@ ds ?
It is a return to Communism ? )
Progress is being made : the inc@@ ar@@ nation and the resur@@ rec@@ tion are being removed .
Je@@ sus will remain the her@@ o that has upset moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be ready to play their part in the ethical debates in our societies and bring about justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity .
Is it not a very Catholic ?
I think I remember that the small number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France were mainly due to the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and then turned into force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago .
I am too hesit@@ ant between buying that , the new A@@ li@@ an game , or W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 .
And the new &quot; E@@ li@@ te game &quot; is soon to come .
That is not the case .
Personally , I would choose So@@ M .
I like W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 ( I even took part in his campaign to raise funds ) , but I do not think it is worth £ 30 .
If it is the P@@ C that is interested in you , Green M@@ an M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is now selling S@@ M 30 to £ 30 and is also proposing a good 20 % reduction .
Gre@@ en M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is now selling S@@ M 30 to £ 30 and is also proposing a good 20 % reduction .
I will look at it .
Of course not at work .
The computer de@@ pres@@ sions in the computer department are blocking all sites .
Is it a good day , is it £ 30 or 20 % reduction , or does £ 30 include the 20 % reduction ?
Let us be careful , however , that the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
It sur@@ prises me , I bought it , but it cannot be .
In addition , I bought it on Ste@@ am , and therefore no re@@ payments , it is n@@ ull and void .

So , in 19@@ 40 , was France a &apos; breeding ground &apos; ?
T@@ ell me , this Nobel Prize seems to me to be a pois@@ oned gift .
We need to love it with the 40 France , the &apos; bizarre defeat &apos; ?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature , one won@@ ders whether P@@ rou@@ st or Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
The Nobel lau@@ reate is not even an event ; there is no desire even to read the primary perpetrators .
Brazili@@ ans , Chinese , or Austr@@ ali@@ ans will read M@@ od@@ ano , who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited and eg@@ regi@@ ous uni@@ verse ?
I hope that the other no@@ vel@@ s are more credible , but frankly I doubt it .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , M@@ ous@@ o , has only a distant report with literature .
Have you read it at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
It would be better to judge .
As for the Chinese , the Brazili@@ ans and others , do not worry for them .
O@@ ut@@ siders are very sensitive to French literature and culture .
They will appreciate Mr President of the Commission .
If they are already aware of it , Mo@@ ano is worth it .
On your side , continue to attend L@@ é@@ vy and Mus@@ sol@@ o .
I agree with you .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me M@@ ous@@ o have every chance .

Mr D@@ Q - no , not today , I have taken my med@@ als .
It is on Wednesday !
I have had a few days of rest .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the beer and ci@@ der of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was restricted .
I have managed to disgu@@ ise 19 different be@@ ers , with W@@ ob@@ bl@@ y We@@ a@@ el being one of my fav@@ our@@ ites .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mi@@ xing of people there , but there were no more than the fana@@ tics of CAMBRIDGE ( not to be confused with the cam@@ era fana@@ tics ) .
As a result of the return on the back Sunday , it was really hard .
On Monday evening , you went to the grand@@ father of a po@@ pp@@ y to play a n@@ in@@ e-@@ c@@ ard .
Thanks to a real opportunity for a start , I have been able to go back with a number of decent b@@ ones .

Yesterday evening I went to a chic@@ ken bar in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my drinks has arrived with a ch@@ ard slic@@ e .
I ad@@ mire Mr
Re@@ ad a bit of Bou@@ d@@ d@@ ha , and you will understand how wrong you are , Christian .
Having said that , without wishing to upset you , I believe that you are moving a little further away from the subject .
This all , it bans the qu@@ e@@ ues for the ji@@ ha@@ d@@ is to get out of the mo@@ squ@@ es .
It points to the fact that arms traffic is to be smugg@@ led without delay .
Either you have a great deal of open eyes such as Med@@ de@@ b and Tai@@ w@@ i or Bou@@ b@@ aker , or you have a very close eye .
We have to choose .
It is not with closed eyes that we have come to light .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , dear Christian , but once again you are making a monu@@ mental counter@@ v@@ ail@@ ing point : all the authorities , organisations or associations that are representative , Muslim or not , having formally condemned the IS and its crimes , the French , or indeed the Muslims , have nothing to add to these unanimous condem@@ nations .
There is no mention of a word .
The problem is that people like you see them first of all as Muslims , Arabs or African .
Not as in French .
Unfortunately , Mrs Mer@@ v@@ el , there is a great deal of doubt about everyone .
As I said a thousand times , there are doubts about the approval by French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be fool@@ ish and improper to accuse them of a pri@@ ori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it .
In my opinion , this principle is the neg@@ ation of the Republic and can only help to break down French society .
There is no doubt about that .
Who does not say a word , but does agree to what ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations to the I@@ As or to the conviction of the I@@ As .
Sil@@ ence is practical , it is the main weapon of those who want to keep the go@@ at and the h@@ at .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but pragmatic untenable .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , in the elections , “ reven@@ ge ” parties represented in West@@ min@@ ster , because a huge gap has wi@@ dened between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence .
Cameron must be pe@@ tri@@ fied to lose all these seats in West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must lau@@ gh .
What are these threats ?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland &apos;s eyes because there is no basis for them .
They can do what they want with electoral impunity .
I do not think that even Cameron is fool@@ ish enough to believe that the L@@ ab@@ our loses seats in West@@ min@@ ster to the S@@ N@@ P ’ s advantage in the long run for him and the Conservatives .
Who is going to make a mo@@ ck@@ ery of the Labour Party .
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the S@@ N@@ P and UK@@ IP , which will lead their heads in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ band joined the &apos; P@@ RO@@ M@@ ES@@ SE &apos; thought that he was res@@ cu@@ ing his party , but without realising that he was signing the death sentence for his Scottish MEPs .
No wonder some Labour Members are asking their leader to be held to account .
If the S@@ N@@ P ear@@ ns 20-@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives , then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised to do for Ma@@ x@@ imum decentralisation .
I believe that this is the most important thing .
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected in England one day .
To put the p@@ um@@ ps of 8 % at the expense of 85 % is not a sup@@ er electoral strategy .
In addition , once Scottish MEPs will no longer be able to vote on matters relating to England , the Conservatives will win all votes .
O@@ h , I think it is .
Cameron may not be much to lose , but M@@ ili@@ band may be .
Mag@@ gi@@ e did it with the Ul@@ ster Uni@@ onists , and it did well .
Yet he is still in a position to be a prime minister in 2015 , and he has been in the same position since he won the Labour Party ’ s leadership .
So , broadly speaking , these bo@@ xes will be virtually behind each read@@ er to look beyond his shoulders and see what he reads , how he reads , and to the end .
It is “ the life of others ” from East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B to F@@ R@@ I@@ C .
The same fasc@@ ination with surveillance techniques .
Ultimately , this will at least have a ster@@ il@@ ising effect .
I await the next ticket : Ama@@ z@@ on manufactured V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E in accordance with V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E , and this automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of its secrecy !

Quite the reverse , in fact .
Thank you for the article .
As in this system , the management of D@@ R@@ M@@ s is not imp@@ aired , I have to read the pir@@ ated files , public domain books or purchased from a few publ@@ ish@@ ers who have the intelligence to put forward files without a mus@@ c@@ le .
In view of the price I have paid the K@@ ob@@ o , it is without regret .

There have been so many exaggerated , er@@ ron@@ eous and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government over the last few days that the country seems to be led by a nur@@ ser@@ y class full of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic gambling .

It is interesting that some supporters of Er@@ dog@@ an believe that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment , but not my own . )
To be sure : – Turkey does not want to sho@@ ot itself in the foot unless it gains something .

A reti@@ red diplom@@ at writ@@ es on his blo@@ g : “ The A@@ P reports that Iran has warned the US that it would be a mistake to seek to over@@ throw Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad , because that would endanger Israel ’ s security .
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious re@@ pris@@ al warning or whether it merely advised caution .
The second option is more likely and , in any case , what really sur@@ prises what is really surprising today is that Iran ’ s and the US ’ s diplomatic engagement concerns Syria , Israel , and the region ’ s security . ”
Indi@@ ans P@@ un@@ ch@@ line &apos;s reading is to be strongly commen@@ ded to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the mainstream media of the traditional media ; the short article you give is important and should be read , bearing in mind the earlier observations / warnings from Iran about Afghanistan around the world . In 1979 - 1980 .
Who are these “ moder@@ ates ” who seriously fight the horrific secular Assad and , at the same time , the I@@ SIS per@@ ver@@ ts ?
The policy of pipelines is pushing the world towards something , and I would suggest to those who refer to the non-existent ‘ moder@@ ates ’ to pay more attention to the facts and to the alternatives before sending the children of the others to fight in the Third World War .
&apos;@@ It is even worse if you take into account Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism &apos; , &apos; Are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?

I can understand why Br@@ and horri@@ fies some people : it sometimes speaks in pre@@ ten@@ tious terms and , after all the absur@@ dities of the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids , it does give the impression of being a beg@@ g@@ ar-@@ th@@ y-@@ neighb@@ or populism , but I think that this whole story of not voting has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my view .
The general consensus seems to be that he is just telling people not to vote and rather to cross the entire political process , but if you look at Pa@@ x@@ man &apos;s interview and other articles / vide@@ os that he has put up , he says that voting once every five years for the L@@ Ab@@ use or the Conservatives ( or Li@@ b D@@ as ) , and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary , the two parties ( to slightly different degrees ) govern essentially in favour of special interests , multinational companies and the rich , at no time does he say that he simply ignores the policy because these parties are on the receiving end of the process . We do not govern on our behalf : it insists that rather than just voting and dis@@ connec@@ ting for five years , people should become much more politically active at local level , organise movements , demonstrations , petitions , no matter and try to influence the policy from that point of view .
I do not say that I necessarily agree with his solution ( because I believe that being politically active by presenting his demands may go hand@@ -@@ in-@@ hand with voting , given that politicians are gi@@ fts that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections ) , but it is a failure to see all these answers . They are con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding who say that Je@@ sus says Je@@ sus tells young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it really is distorting his arguments .
His solution is extremely questionable , and it would be good if people were to debate what it actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people who have been left out .
Yes , thank you .
The vote on the vote was completely distorted .
The un@@ desi@@ ra@@ bility of sli@@ pping into a bul@@ le@@ tin every five years makes me deeply anno@@ yed that my vote really does not count for anything .
I want more referendums , electronic voting , direct democracy and Members who report to their voters locally .
In addition , I dispute the idea that Rus@@ sell Br@@ and &apos;s words are not their own ( written by others ) .
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas , even though they are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-@@ culture thin@@ kers and aca@@ demics that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne would like to bring together under the label “ p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ite . ”
I am quite convinced that , in a debate , he would succeed in convincing Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne .
Perhaps that is what the Guar@@ dian could do , that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne is like Pol@@ l@@ ly T@@ y@@ n@@ be@@ e and the Rus@@ sell interview on a bic@@ ycle , even with the r@@ ated ho@@ ops of the world !
Like Ma@@ x K@@ e@@ is@@ er , who initially attacked Rus@@ s@@ sel , but ended up becoming one of his f@@ ans and inviting him into his programme , it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he is coming from .
It has been in a political dis@@ course that has existed for generations , but it has been margin@@ alized by the traditional media - including the Guar@@ dian - for generations .
In my view , this “ fron@@ t@@ line ” reveals , above all , that the intellectual debate has long not been held in history in the history of history in which professional histor@@ ians have become a minority , and the exchange of specialists has become poorer for the benefit of P@@ o P@@ o ’ s S@@ C@@ V@@ s for press records .
For my part , I saw the intellectual attitude of Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ e@@ u as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need to attack a cul@@ pri@@ t , a scapego@@ at .
They develop very rational thinking , but this ration@@ ality is based on those scapego@@ ats that are the ke@@ y@@ stone of their thinking .
I believe , rather , that for F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult the State was indispensable as a cul@@ pri@@ t .
This is a very ar@@ cha@@ ic thought , the thought sacrificed , which is also the magic thinking .
The problem in the report is resolved by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ ic , new , and / or liber@@ tarian han@@ do@@ ver ( the second is a har@@ sh@@ er of the desire to eradicate the state , the first knowing going to seek government relief for its markets ) in the sense of the least state / not at least of the state at home . in writing .
The old dream of the base that is self-@@ organising itself .
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state : without this cul@@ p@@ ability it does not stand up .
Anyone who says that they are guilty , says elimination , murder and sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here .
Nor is there any support .
The totalitarian left re@@ members the good old time , that of his go@@ d , Stalin , the small father of the people .
O@@ u@@ ala , you probably read too quickly , if you took the texts of the F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult on the Iranian revolution for an apo@@ logy of K@@ home@@ ini .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ ent would have no more am@@ using to attack Michel in this way ...
G@@ o away a profound reflection on the contemporary person and the collective , on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether one agrees with him or not , it is an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
Se@@ eing this cab@@ al or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by hard-@@ left human scientists who do not bear the burden of al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ as is lau@@ g@@ hable enough .
The nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism and author@@ itarianism of these people are without limits .
One important point to add seems to me to be the position of these &apos; rebels &apos; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of the Chinese and other ‘ y@@ el@@ low ’ people in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You did not have the pleasure of hearing our Austr@@ ali@@ an friends on this subject .
And where was it in Russia , that a Russian person could meet with a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I do not remember when I saw a Chinese last time .
In London , they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time , in a market .
The Chinese think the same thing about wh@@ ites !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them say violent anti-@@ B@@ lan@@ ks .
My father is not happy with his el@@ dest daughter with a White .
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and , above all , in recent years : they are becoming richer , prosperity is spreading outside the major cities , and thanks to this prosperity , people travel abroad and see how the others live .
As I have been told , the Russians mainly have prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia , who work in occup@@ ations and in areas where they are very lucky to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence .
Although I have lived on the banks of the I@@ en@@ is@@ i River , in Si@@ ber@@ ia , I have lived .
Unfortunately , I have heard the views of the Austr@@ ali@@ ans about the Chinese and the Ab@@ ori@@ genes .
It is really strange that a foreign@@ er tells me that I am not standing up for the Chinese , when I met two of them in my life ( including one abroad ) , who did not have bad memories , all people are equally good and , in fact , those in London were very nice to be the only one . That is why I remembered that they were Chinese .
Otherwise , we do not remember who we meet , all people are equal , how we remember who was .
Do you know what is bizarre ?
You and the other Russian people are talking to the Chinese as a kind of unique fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attr@@ action in a zo@@ o .
And yet you always come out with the B@@ lan@@ c .
How many Chinese men are with wh@@ ites , by comparison ?
None , because there is a great deal of likelihood that the parents of these White B@@ lan@@ ks will bring them to an end .
No measure for the im@@ partiality of justice .
However , it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipul@@ ated by groups that are strong on the left , such as the union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy ...
I would like to apolo@@ gi@@ ze for the fact that I was sorry , but the judiciary is a right .
When the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy , it only re@@ pres@@ ses 25 % of the judges .
If a measure of its partiality can be made on the basis of the rela@@ tivity of law enforcement in the courts , it orders two obstacles to be removed .
It is the observer ’ s political vision such as that of the judiciary ’ s factual interpretation .
It then remains the necessary law tool to re@@ focus the assessment on fundamentals .
The extent to which it in@@ forms in all the judicial acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , including the public prosecutor ’ s office , must make a distinction between the error and the partiality of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates .
It would be pointless to pretend that justice does not spread between these three groups .
The claim and lack of knowledge does not come under an objective analysis .
And , if all this is not analysed , how then can we claim that justice is improving in France ?
If it is only by means of statistics that it is implic@@ itly re@@ minis@@ cent of it .
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio .
The question of the corruption of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy of the judiciary .
C@@ ho@@ o@@ sing in proportion to the power of len@@ i@@ ency that is being given to the judicial institution that is capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The area that is considered to be he@@ irs to he@@ irs , which has been committed to the use of fraud in the proceedings of the success@@ ors , has been followed by no@@ tar@@ ies .
This profession gets a good deal of EUR 150 million , while at the same time benefiting from the se@@ aled coverage by the virtual legal impunity of the French no@@ tary .
In order to understand their mechanism , part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication .
Where this is in line with the previous , moderate statistical improvement , the legal institution produced , in many of the differences between the gener@@ al@@ og@@ ist and the he@@ irs that are reluctant to pull themselves together , a whole set of laws that are contrary to all the laws favourable to the he@@ irs .
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring these kinds of rational criteria then a cra@@ zy form of lie ?
P@@ ric@@ es that are certainly totally prohibi@@ tive .
Another piece of equipment for for@@ ging the disabled is equipment .
One can say that , but my bro@@ ther has one of these tri@@ alogues , which is tail@@ or-@@ made to its size and weight , and it has really enabled him to enjoy the full air as ever a normal whe@@ el@@ chair , with heavy whe@@ el@@ chair and ty@@ pe@@ -@@ ty@@ re , could not .
As they say , g@@ ates and col@@ ours ...
T@@ an@@ k@@ ch@@ ai@@ ri is like what Je@@ re@@ my C@@ lar@@ k@@ son could invent for a challenge in T@@ op Ge@@ ar .

I think that the inven@@ tor of the W@@ h@@ ill has never had to clean up a dog cr@@ ack on a hen@@ ch@@ man .
I am sure my s@@ ister would love the tric@@ ks , but it is simply too expensive .
The long-@@ distance driver would be perfect for a disabled person with a pen@@ bo@@ y pen@@ ch@@ ant .
Here there are h@@ ills that they would like to see .
P@@ ric@@ es appear to be high , but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bic@@ ycle , so ‘ you see ’ .
It seems to me to be particularly useful for the tri@@ alogues to take place .
Not all disabled people are poor , however .
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal .
Only if they have become disabled .
The tr@@ ick is that the whe@@ el@@ chair market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford high prices for things they know they need .
It cannot really be said that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
This is an example of excessive design .
Unfortunately , it is just a draft , there is no plan to manufacture it .
I am CO@@ NT@@ N@@ T that the &apos; long distance &apos; does not come onto the market , because apparently there is no way to drive this fi@@ g .
Almost 20 000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombing of den@@ sely populated residential areas .

Hal@@ f is children and young people who are under the age of 18 .

Pop@@ ul@@ ist and Pop@@ ul@@ ist Re@@ action
In fact , we do not know too much what Mar@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see that ?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I am not sure that Spe@@ e really was &apos; refused &apos; to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed to be sure of the exact strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ sia in his book ‘ C@@ ast@@ les of Ste@@ el ’ suggests that Spe@@ e quickly left the zone because he had received a report indicating a British co@@ oling in the area .
The sea was heated at the beginning of the day ; I do not know whether this was still the case at the end of the battle ?
Similarly , the fight came to an end after the sun was sun@@ k , making all rescue operations more difficult .
Comp@@ are this with the next battle of the Fal@@ k@@ lands , where , on the photo@@ graph@@ s of the survi@@ v@@ ors who are now res@@ cu@@ ed , we see a sea that is calm and in the open .
Moreover , the res@@ cu@@ ers knew that there were no more German fighters at this stage in the area .
H@@ m@@ m , it does not really correspond to what I remember reading on this battle , so I made a quick research on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia :
“ There was some confusion among German ships about the fate of the two co@@ ff@@ ers , which had disappeared in the black after ending the fire , and a continuation started .
The L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g lives in something in fire , but it is just as close to him that it was just a wrec@@ k .
N@@ ü@@ r@@ n@@ berg , slower than other German ships , is re@@ joining the battle be@@ lat@@ edly and living on Mon@@ mo@@ th , pen@@ ned and seriously damaged , but still on the move .
After pointing out its spot@@ light on the ship &apos;s flag , the proposal to go was refused and opened the fire , finally bringing the ship off the ho@@ ok .
Without reliable information , von Spe@@ e judged that the Go@@ od@@ d H@@ ope had escap@@ ed and arrested the research at 2@@ 2.@@ 15 .
Inte@@ rest@@ ingly , reports indicate a British co@@ oling in the surrounding area , and he went to the north . ”
So , if it is true , the Germans , trying to keep the ra@@ d@@ ar in the dark before the ra@@ d@@ ar , did not know that a ship had s@@ ank , and therefore could not look for survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also thought that there was a greater co@@ oling of the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y in the area that could have caused serious damage , so in the confusion they ab@@ ound to take advantage of their advance .
They were a long way from their base and Spe@@ e was well aware that they should find their way through many of the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y vessels .
C@@ ra@@ do@@ k ’ s sacrifice had already done them harm and cost them about half of their am@@ muni@@ tion , condemning them when they finally became caught .
There are a number of voices in the U@@ M@@ P calling for it to be enshrined in the law that an elected person who has been definitively convicted is permanently in@@ eligible .
This is a courageous position , which would also affect left-wing Members of Parliament .

When will there be a ban on trade unions in sectors already protected ?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens ?
The vision of society is limited to these sectors , which are always ready to take advantage of their in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ability in order to hinder the actions of real policies , which are really trying to get things moving , not the beautiful spoken talk . The lack of action is a measure of the extent to which they are complac@@ ent .
I met them in the me@@ tr@@ o at mid@@ day with their little b@@ ann@@ ers &apos; for justice &apos; they came from province and did not make the difference between Ber@@ c@@ y and P@@ P@@ B .
It supports the existence of politici@@ zed trade unions that members place the enormous power they hold at the service of his party .
It would not defend the same views if right-wing , or even right-wing , unions target person@@ alities on his side and run a legal war against them .
Your asser@@ tions are completely free of charge .
If , at the moment , the right is w@@ rest@@ ling with the current situation in the judiciary , it is simply that it has committed the facts .
There is no example of a left-wing person who has had so much to do with the justice system , but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated in favour .
On the other hand , it must also be pointed out that the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy union which is left-wing is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and that it is a minority .
Let a minister with so much commitment to the trade unions show how useful they can be .
At the same time as the trade union you mentioned is perhaps a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but his influence is very much in the hands of the Chancellor , it is not a secret .
We are now wondering whether the &apos; mission &apos; of some judges is more d@@ az@@ z@@ ling rather than liter@@ ate .
Th@@ ink - you should be satisfied , the S@@ M is a minority .
What are you complaining about ?

Good morning , K@@ ow@@ l W@@ ai@@ l .
I believe that even the most star@@ ving deb@@ tor of gl@@ ory realise that X@@ -@@ F@@ ac@@ tor can only sign@@ i@@ fy the end of a career , so I would be surprised if someone could accept their offer .
Many have used it as a spr@@ ing@@ board to start a successful career .
The O@@ D@@ Cs fill stad@@ i@@ ums around the world .
Others then sold many dis@@ cs or left for West En@@ d .
Po@@ st@@ ars , the fore@@ run@@ ner of all these programmes , have launched Ch@@ re@@ l Col@@ le , which is , in fact , part of the ju@@ ries .
Even A@@ B@@ B@@ A , O@@ li@@ via New@@ ton@@ -@@ John , C@@ é@@ é@@ ne Di@@ on , C@@ li@@ ff Richard , all involved the Euro@@ vision , like so many others .
While others like Fr@@ ank Sin@@ at@@ ra and all the rest have participated in the US .
In the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s , New F@@ ac@@ es and opportunities launched most of British television st@@ ars .
Of course , some have been forgotten .
But that is what happens to most of the st@@ ars who do not participate in the competi@@ tions .
Fe@@ w people , after a tu@@ be , manage to do others .
In any case , most s@@ ong@@ s / groups can best expect three al@@ bu@@ ms and b@@ is of .
O@@ ut@@ side , but now Co@@ le , or whatever it may be , has no f@@ ans only in the United Kingdom .
His celebr@@ ity comes partly from his marriage with a foot@@ b@@ all@@ er who is brea@@ thing in his mouth .
Most Americans know who is Je@@ re@@ my C@@ lar@@ k@@ son .
It can only sign@@ i@@ fy the end of a career .
In fact , it is more likely to lead to a career than to the typical ro@@ ck route , even though in your dreams you believe that all the gu@@ ta@@ pe@@ ting f@@ umes from the grass in their father &apos;s gar@@ age and as a whole in three agreements on a po@@ em of primary school will surely become a primary school . St@@ art and the only question is how much they want to touch even before they get out of an al@@ bu@@ m .
And , worse than ridiculous : it sets a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the people studied – dist@@ an@@ cing relatively quickly to racism , because sac@@ ra@@ zing eth@@ no@@ log@@ ists present us with these distant people as infin@@ itely super@@ sti@@ tious and lit@@ eral of rit@@ ual bi@@ go@@ try , while most of them have their own . How to do this is strictly equivalent to our own and , like our own , practical considerations on a daily basis .
Ex@@ cep@@ t that you are interpreting in the opposite direction .
So , but rather than say that the dr@@ ums are un@@ sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t , is it not better to admit that our Mari@@ e and our Mor@@ li@@ ans do not also have a little sac@@ red character ?
Our way is as it should be to see the sac@@ red as a sort of well-@@ defined object and circum@@ s@@ cri@@ be the religious sphere .
That is very interesting in any case .
It is dec@@ o ep@@ e@@ em@@ ere to m@@ our@@ n the vacuum .
Nothing more .
I would like to say a few words of thanks .
The recent Pan@@ the@@ st of the Republic &apos;s illu@@ stri@@ ous figures is an illustration of the fact that the sense of sac@@ red feeling still lives .
Who still believes in the interpretation of ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists !
Any other discipline would be subject to the no@@ ses of any scientific interpretation that har@@ ms the lives of a man@@ dar@@ in , rarely less .
When do we have a comparative cri@@ ti@@ que of discipl@@ ines to make a little jo@@ ke ?
Because what applies to ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology also applies to the interpretations of other discipl@@ ines .
This would provide a do@@ se of sal@@ u@@ tary mode@@ sty .
Your contempt for ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists is totally unjustified !
It is thanks to them that we are constantly dis@@ covering trea@@ sures , valuable testi@@ monies to re@@ plen@@ ish history , to understand societies , and the example here of comparative ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology is exciting .
This method is not very old and previously ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists relied on their “ inst@@ inc@@ ts ” and knowledge , and could be wrong .
Nowadays , there are such effective technical and scientific resources that the inter@@ pre@@ tation of sear@@ ches is better , but can always be called into question by other disco@@ veries !

No , it is not because the video is considered too violent that the I@@ IA is blocking the images of the accident , but because one of the Commissioners ag@@ it@@ ated is clearly a green flag , a sign that the race can resume normally and that you are more under the regime of y@@ el@@ low flag .

Yes , E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , the race is no longer under the terms of a y@@ el@@ low P@@ A@@ P@@ ES flag the place of the accident , and hence the green flag .
That is the usual procedure .
The one-@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ fit@@ s-@@ all comm@@ ander down@@ stream of the accident ( depending on the case , may be 10@@ -@@ me@@ tre after the accident ) ag@@ ite the green to say to the pil@@ ots of a normal allu@@ sion .
Sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism is selling the pu@@ b .
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government &apos;s &apos; patri@@ otic &apos; propaganda offensive , but I am afraid that , at the end of the day , it is just for money .
And gender , let us not forget sex , the fear of not having sex , the pu@@ b and the media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ations are doing exactly the same thing .
Do@@ ing the bu@@ z@@ z with inf@@ os , which we really do not need to care about , is just to continue to be afraid of the people so that they can continue to control them .
“ When t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids on E@@ bol@@ a , we all appeal to fear , ” it should be “ der@@ ail@@ ing , ” not “ s@@ nu@@ ff . ”
In view of the medical reference , ‘ un@@ bund@@ ling ’ is much better said in this context than ‘ der@@ ail@@ ing ’ .
I wonder whether all the w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be E@@ bol@@ a might start to spread by air realise that they now believe in evolution ?
You are giving them too much honour .
They probably think that the end of the world and E@@ bol@@ a is just one of the signs of the apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se that is approaching .
E@@ bol@@ a is the An@@ t@@ ch@@ ris@@ t !
You are confusing E@@ bol@@ a and Mur@@ do@@ ch ...
Sup@@ ple@@ mentary , thank you !
A short and conc@@ ise article that makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of this des@@ pic@@ able p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ journ@@ alism .
That was a good thing for me .
As far as I am concerned , the media are talking about most things with such optimism .
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frigh@@ tened and anxious ( not to get to hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to get us out of business when it needs it .
I believe it is perfectly logical that , if we are to have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack , why not have an E@@ bol@@ a crisis in the absence of any evidence ?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself invented .
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations on this post , and to be as yet in this world almost 35 years later .
In addition , it had to be horrific , given the context of the 198@@ 0-@@ 90 years .
I am g@@ lu@@ ff@@ ed , living with the certainty of going there for years … .@@ . .
There is absolutely no need for this .
As always , when we talk about science .
Not only do testi@@ monies serve no purpose : they cannot be used as a scientific material in isolation .
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts .
@ traffic : testi@@ monies cannot be used as a scientific material .
Perhaps that is why we are refra@@ ining from putting questions to psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry when we have reliable observations from the relatives .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric dossier mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ atric mother explains that I have been educated pa@@ thetic by her mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
This is therefore an objective symp@@ tom .
When I say that it is a crow@@ d , it is a subjec@@ tive testi@@ mony of no importance .
A@@ h , because the at@@ te@@ station of a fact ( such as this testi@@ mony , which testi@@ fies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments ) serves no purpose in a scientific approach ?
What do you base the research on , then ?
O@@ ut of fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es ?
Do you have the same level of fan@@ ci@@ ful the@@ ories and facts ( giving rise to veri@@ fiable testi@@ monies ) ?
“ Re@@ si@@ li@@ ence ” is the word ‘ bi@@ don ’ a@@ mo@@ ted by the grand@@ mothers , from J@@ -@@ L Del@@ ar@@ ue ’ s f@@ ans , who take themselves for large psycho@@ log@@ ists after reading D ’ s anc@@ ill@@ ary .
@ J@@ im : there are empty b@@ ick@@ ering in the psy@@ che .
C@@ r@@ ul@@ ni@@ i@@ k struck us with “ resili@@ ence . ”
As it is a great scienti@@ st , Car@@ ry@@ ul@@ ni@@ k , I hope that he will have co@@ b@@ b@@ led together a reliable scale of measu@@ rement to quanti@@ fy it , this famous resili@@ ence .
I wonder whether the air scienti@@ st could all save us from Far@@ age and company ?
Do you not think about Te@@ am America ?
Ser@@ iously , it is not a good idea to have a good idea of bringing the air from the air ...
So why ?
It was a gen@@ tle series and it would seem that those who stand by it are aware of this .
So let us sal@@ ute the all-@@ powerful who can work mirac@@ les .
But how are they going to make children hun@@ t ?
The only solution that comes to mind is pe@@ anu@@ ts , which would kill the whole package .
It was already a number of children .
Children were hanging .
A@@ h , because it is a number of children ?

It will not be the same if you do not see the s@@ ons and the anim@@ ation is made .
I look forward to seeing this ( though an adult ) , but I hope that this will give the idea of a chain to spread the old .
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia ; it is at least 40 years on Saturday and Sunday at 0@@ 6 h@@ . .
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago , it has been on one of the second-@@ class commercial channels and we can always see it in these hours .
And , in addition to the half-@@ hour episo@@ des , it is now at 05 : 30 , from Monday to Friday !
F@@ ine , I am probably a &apos; sad 60 years &apos; , but I am not looking at it every day !
There is no &apos; M@@ oun@@ t of temp@@ le &apos; in or under the mo@@ s@@ que of the es@@ plan@@ ades ! !
The radical Z@@ ion@@ ists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colon@@ ise Jerusalem .
Moreover , all Israeli crow@@ ds below and around the mo@@ s@@ que of the es@@ p@@ ades for several decades have not helped .
The m@@ oun@@ t of the temp@@ le , if there is any such thing , is somewhere else .
Can it be in Argentina ?
This is not intended for the simple reason that it is the h@@ ill on which the mo@@ squ@@ es of the mo@@ squ@@ es were built .
His summit , or one of the Ro@@ cher , is s@@ lam@@ ed in the middle of Om@@ ar ’ s mo@@ s@@ que .
For Muslims , Mo@@ ham@@ med has risen to he@@ a@@ ven from the ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it was M@@ oun@@ t M@@ oriz@@ ah , where A@@ bra@@ ham failed to sacrifice his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
As long as it has been taken and cont@@ ex@@ tual , there is no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also has its extremists , it is good to remind them of it regularly , and they are unfortunately re@@ located to the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i Ben@@ net , A@@ vig@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Netanyahu , who had accepted the 2 states plan , and s@@ ounded it continuously ! ) .
It is also good to show how peaceful the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is .
Will he be able to recognise his own ?
The shor@@ test of the Jewish jo@@ ke : &apos; God is lau@@ ded ! &apos;
In order to bo@@ ast about tourism in Israel , we often have young na@@ ï@@ ve na@@ ï@@ ve , al@@ anc@@ ies on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usual , very different from what advertising shows us , as can be seen from the pho@@ to that illustrates the article .
Even so , it is a bit frigh@@ tening .
And that photo@@ grap@@ h is a wonderful piece of propaganda !
It is a pity that the photo@@ grap@@ her of Re@@ u@@ ters did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to return to the M@@ oun@@ t M@@ oun@@ t , who prefer to go back to the Jews as counter@@ v@@ ail@@ s , pra@@ ying to the W@@ ail@@ ing Wall .
@ at , if this photo@@ grap@@ h distur@@ bs you , it is right , it is not the newspaper or the photo@@ grap@@ her , but the woman and the ideology it trans@@ mits that must be condemned .
This system is unsustainable and will end up as a la@@ ugh@@ ing stock .
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution .
E@@ ver since the economy appears to be s@@ mil@@ ing , large companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages , while at the same time , without hiding , they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top .
You are right , it is not tenable , but it will only change in that country when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of wasting and ge@@ aring when someone else is on strike , support them , show a bit of solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems , but also shows your employer not to em@@ ul@@ ate people with impunity .
Unless we abandon democracy , in which case if it is sustainable .
I fully agree .
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
For example , China and India .
All of this cannot come to an end .
It is because we are in a democracy that it has held .
Have you voted for the T@@ T@@ IP ?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ IP ) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and states is about .
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the un@@ imagin@@ able damage that this agreement will have on our lives .
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about this in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ ans World Development on the other hand , and you will understand these links , and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back .
Did Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill not say &apos; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &apos; ?
This is an excellent fall@@ acy , while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
This gentle@@ man is right , in X@@ V@@ III there were trade unions in every rule .
In the very French armed Catholic , there is a dimension that is being sacrificed .
Let it ( at last , its officers , others , no one knows anything ) believe that it is the co@@ ff@@ er of the e@@ ternal values of France , and it will fight and shut its back .
Then , with the decline of the country , globalisation , Europe , the crisis of values , in short , the dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this small re@@ lic , is comfor@@ ting .
Even if it is , it is becoming increasingly un@@ comfortable ...
They still lack married men , c@@ ali@@ bre men , married women , c@@ ali@@ br@@ aries , dogs lost and I do not know what is going on .
If you do not write the French correctly , I do .
You have been warned , it will be your fault .
In defence of vested interests , there is already enough protection for protected professions with trade unions , which has created a breach of equality with other citizens .
We are being asked not to lau@@ gh about the fear of risk by an official .
One can imagine a system of freedom of expression without trade unions , or without a right to strike as in Germany , in return for the protection they enjoy .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively , it would be a disaster .
And , with the char@@ ts that are being prepared , the government is pleased about that .
What security are you talking about ?
Indeed , I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance ...
I was referring to the military and other civil servants , since this is the subject of the debate .
Let us read &apos; through its delegates &apos; in Article 8 of the preamble to the Constitution of 19@@ 46 .
It will become &apos; 8 .
Every worker particip@@ ates in collective determination of working conditions and in business management &apos; .
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of informa@@ tive power .
And yet you have opened up a specific article , &apos; The Great British B@@ aker &apos; . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
Wa@@ it , the section was there , there was no vacuum .
I thought that the convers@@ ation had to be started .
In any case , it was the J@@ off@@ rey marriage that I looked at , and I can tell you that some have been well s@@ ounded .
In the J@@ off@@ rey marriage episo@@ de , one of the best moments ( though misleading : it was wine ) in the history of television .
As a result , the sl@@ ump ...
G@@ ame of Tha@@ i !
I love G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
It is the second time in a row that , stran@@ gely enough , the issue is ending with a victory for the che@@ apest b@@ aker ; no one has done a kind of &apos; but@@ am , that is my ca@@ ke now and you are going to your master &apos; !
Perhaps additional pressure from friends and relatives has finally had an effect for them ?
In previous weeks , all these people outside were kept on the side@@ lines .
And there is also this idea of “ playing security , there is always next week ” that will disappear in the last week .
I like co@@ o@@ king , but I do not think I can do that .
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us a sup@@ er enter@@ tainment and push us to try new things .
In the case of G@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree , the last challenge last year , the w@@ ed@@ ding ca@@ ke , was absurd .
Prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als usually take days to do so , and they would have to co@@ b@@ ble together one in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three challenges were really difficult to share , I do not know how they were able to choose a winner .
In Lu@@ is , the only real short@@ coming was that they could find it a little dry basis ( though I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that the green ice on Richard ’ s m@@ ill did not en@@ vy , in any case Richard had already lost at that point ) .
I have to say that several challenges of this series seem to be somewhat artificial due to the time allocated .
There is also the cancer that is cu@@ red , with wind b@@ lows .
There is no doubt that we are all successful at the moment .
We hope that this is a bad moment for humanity .
You confuse solar and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys .
The U@@ V@@ s are blocked mainly by the ozone layer , which is formed precisely by the impact of the par@@ ticles of resid@@ ual wind and U@@ V wind .
So even if the mag@@ netic field was weakened , there would not be enough solar wind to “ hun@@ t ” the str@@ at@@ o@@ sphere ’ s ozone .
There would be even more , and thus less U@@ V and “ canc@@ ers . ”
Fortunately , the ozone layer is not blocking U@@ V@@ s .
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect .
If they are limited to human beings , they have an interest in enabling us to have b@@ ones ( vitam@@ in D ) , heating ( less than the in@@ tric@@ acies ) , mod@@ ul@@ ating our immune system and , it seems , improving our mor@@ ale .
The ozone layer is blocking the carcino@@ gen@@ s and is leaving U@@ V@@ A and most U@@ V@@ B .
You know that you are not obliged to be con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding and to regard your interlocu@@ tor as an stay when you make a comment ?
Especially for a minor prec@@ ision , which was implied in the comment , which itself intends to be ped@@ ago@@ gical .
Without saying that I am used to mel@@ anom@@ a , U@@ V@@ s are only AC@@ C@@ L@@ R its development .
They are not the P@@ RO@@ V@@ O@@ Q@@ U@@ EN@@ N@@ T .
E@@ vi@@ dence of this is that all of them are not necessarily mel@@ ancho@@ ly .
Well , when you tell you that you have to avoid the sun and live on a cell@@ ar , it is better not to listen , because the U@@ V@@ s are necessary for every human being .
The excess , on the other hand , is like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
V@@ ul@@ ages directly cause mel@@ anom@@ a .
Is it possible to do so ?
And , more importantly , can we go through it ?
or pass it on to the mi@@ gh@@ ty ...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be complied with if there is sufficient force and the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the i@@ Ph@@ one 6 is perfectly acceptable , for the use to which it is intended .
I believe that the army needs something more resili@@ ent and has therefore not yet adopted the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e@@ 6 as fron@@ t-@@ line communications equipment .
But for us ,
It remains a good choice .
The majority of those concerned have established that everything can be complied with if there is sufficient force there .
With a No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
More specifically , has it already been complied with ?
It is a jo@@ ke in every discussion .
I have decided to count them .
It is the fourth jo@@ ke on the pl@@ age I read in the comments today .
It is difficult to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before there are specific software , one can imagine that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain and it is hard to see how it could come back .
So , &apos; m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ m@@ m@@ um@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ..@@ ... &apos; .
The most likely thing is that it is a production unit on which the i@@ O@@ S has not been inst@@ alled properly and is therefore stuck with the inst@@ alled plant test code .
I do not know at all how they are doing these tric@@ ks .
But would they put a test software on all of them ?
P@@ ho@@ graph@@ s about E@@ bas@@ ay clearly show the absence of F@@ C@@ I or EC lo@@ go and the presence of a proto@@ type red link .
The article for B@@ ob@@ o par excellence .
You want cheap products , and it is a surprise that industri@@ alists produce a “ business ” “ industry , but all the teaching teachers and small businesses are concerned about how to move good , bi@@ o ad@@ a@@ c 16@@ 50 ( an average f@@ es@@ tive salary ) ?
But to answer your post , if it is possible to eat properly with a small wage .
After all , it is free to put its priorities where it sees fit .
For my part , food is one of them .
G@@ o without gr@@ ud@@ g@@ ingly , I emb@@ ol@@ den you .
People who see the world through an ideological “ software ” that leads them to dis@@ connect from reality are called “ B@@ ob@@ os , ” or even “ b@@ ob@@ o@@ col@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ s . ”
It is un@@ wise un@@ bund@@ ling .
They are expert in post@@ uring , for example , trying to save the planet because they have avoided taking a show@@ er .
He is also experts in tar@@ d@@ iness , joining in this , for example , with the lef@@ to@@ ver , which they sometimes come from , for example , by condemning CO2 emissions while , at the same time , passing on their holiday to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not bear this mix@@ ture of red tape and delays , too , when they often meet with criticism of them .
W@@ a@@ ou@@ h , thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive the@@ or@@ isation , as well as for all the associated details ( aircraft , dubious … ) .
I would like to be one of them , but I do not find myself in it .
The concept is not so complicated .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ lo@@ s are mon@@ k@@ lo@@ c .
Have you understood the concept of energy ha@@ ca@@ -@@ ca@@ vi@@ ar ?
Well , you are in a position to understand the concept of &apos; green &apos; .
It is a perfect copy of an ideological nu@@ ance .
The classification would be more complicated if we were to take an interest in eco@@ lo@@ s at all .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ col@@ o is one of them , but only the most visible part of the eco@@ lo@@ s , because it is the one that in@@ fe@@ sts the media .
That is a fine gi@@ fe .
Ap@@ parently , no one wants to look at the game in front of us .
It is so bad that it looks v@@ agu@@ ely like a na@@ ked female .
You are next to the pl@@ ate .
We need to be a micro@@ co@@ s@@ m of art to understand the ast@@ ounding beau@@ ty of truth in this work .
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment , because you have not spent many decades studying and pan@@ dering to great artists .
The important thing is not that El@@ in does not know and always seems to be obs@@ essed with the same subject .
The important thing is that it has really managed to become extremely rich and famous by having no artistic capacity .
It is a case of wh@@ i@@ pping up .
No , it is a ch@@ at .
The fact that El@@ in is not aware
That is not really a proven fact .
Rather , it is an opinion .
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs who smoke by playing the b@@ ill@@ board .
Jud@@ ging art can be problematic , but not in that case .
De@@ fin@@ ing , it is more than simply representing the real .
If you only seek to do that , then there will be a photo@@ grap@@ h .
The author also speaks of E@@ mi@@ in &apos;s ex@@ termination .
Look again and let the image speak of itself , without compar@@ ing it with the kind of design that you perhaps prefer .
If that is so easy , why do you not do it yourself ?
There is still a need for savings : equi@@ valence activities , the number of hor@@ ses of the Republican guard or the status of the generals who are no longer in active service ..@@ .@@ .
( Hon@@ est@@ y forces France to reduce its workforce , but as all countries have done , sometimes even more drastically , starting with Great Britain .
It is only half encouraging ...
Oper@@ ation without support quickly has its limits !
A sing@@ ular approach , at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses , the in@@ adequ@@ acies of our defence tool , particularly in the Sa@@ hel .
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned , who lose a dimension of their activities , or even part of their history .
Where is the promised sanc@@ tu@@ ary ?
@ ed@@ mon@@ d : that is what I was saying , look at elsewhere where savings are being made but , above all , not at home , in my home , it really is not possible ...
That is exactly what you are proposing to do , looking elsewhere to see where there is a certain amount of waste .
All those who have come together with little or no military authority dare to come here and say that there is no money squ@@ an@@ dered on this per@@ im@@ e@@ ter and that this is not a la@@ ugh@@ ing stock .
Let the same po@@ tion apply to the public service as a whole , and public finances will go a little better .
And for Jo@@ i : look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries , and you will understand why the defense may be a little busy !
Yes , the economies on which everyone agrees that they have to be done , must be seen somewhere , no ?
A po@@ t of po@@ t , those on whom that gra@@ b@@ bed murder when it happens at home , the cher@@ ished poor .
We would have to do it , but , above all , it would not fall on me because , in this case , it is a crime and not an economy .
What you are saying is going !
In what way will the V@@ al de Gra@@ ce be closed down will weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As for the local authorities , history repe@@ ats each other &apos;s job closures , maternity , hospital , bar@@ r@@ acks .
But , of course , everyone is in favour of economies .
It is strange , a U@@ M@@ P may@@ or who wants compensation and does not welcome the savings made in public spending .
This article really is the most st@@ agg@@ ering tr@@ ick I have ever read !
This embarrassing moment , in which the first three people who comm@@ its the same bad jo@@ ke .
It is the de@@ pres@@ s@@ ation to drive down his thre@@ ad Fac@@ e@@ book and to see that 80 % of his friends started their stat@@ utes with the phrase “ this embarrassing moment . ”
I believe that they are going to make a film .
It will certainly be based on shocking scenes in which someone comes to work at the workplace by accident and only becomes aware of the fact that his ju@@ pe has come back into his tr@@ ous@@ ers .
It is not embarrassing , it is completely c@@ on .
Not really , in my view , the author adopts the role of the typical British man , who has always learned to bur@@ y his emotions and sha@@ ke his te@@ eth .
I am sure that if you are a f@@ an of K@@ ate Bush , the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong .
You are aware that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights ?
I do not have the Internet .
So I do not think I can comment .
Do not have a computer .
My go@@ d , I have to have this film before we die !
I do not think that this article is the most incredible thing I have ever read !
It really has just been demonstrated that he is at the top of the summit of the co@@ sm@@ ic uni@@ verse of sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
That is the opposite of what I have to say !
It is absolutely essential that I share with all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter that they finally have ill@@ um@@ ination and dis@@ close un@@ believ@@ able fl@@ ul@@ ur@@ ation and the insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us with Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s ke@@ y@@ board as a div@@ ine light .
Well , it really was n@@ ull and void .
Above all else , it is neither women nor the m@@ our@@ ning .
I am a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive development within democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective community initiatives .
Until further order , we have taken away the right to save our planet by states that are playing the br@@ unt of every meeting to save the planet .
We are therefore deciding , citizens , to take things in hand .
With the Commissioner who has worked on energy , all these fine recommendations have been stolen ..@@ .@@ .
K@@ e@@ ep it : E@@ li@@ ens and solar farms are tomorrow &apos;s points .
This is financed by the con@@ sign@@ ment .
Please stop this pro-@@ nuclear speech .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
Rad@@ i@@ o@@ activity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not fully controlled , it is better to limit it to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energies are our only sal@@ vation , provided , of course , that our consumption is drastically reduced .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able electricity to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is in no way concerned .
Nuclear power is a zero CO2 emissions from production and ep@@ il@@ on for the other stages .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity and V@@ V is already more than G@@ H@@ G on other steps , especially gas , or , worse , coal as well as Germany , to compensate for inter@@ mit@@ tent inter@@ mit@@ tent .
Re@@ placing nuclear by renewable renewable or P@@ V would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Christian , I am not insul@@ ting you , I am a head of state in the 198@@ 1 physical sciences , and I have carried out nuclear physi@@ cs research I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said .
As for what I did not say , I did not say anything about Germany , I did not say anything about Germany , in fact you did not respond to what I said and like all right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ish the interlocu@@ tor I never do .
I would also mention the conclusion of experts man@@ dated by the German Government : Germany ’ s current programme of renewable energy is an un@@ profitable and ineffective means of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and should be stopped .
0 emissions emissions if you do not count on the extraction of uranium and construction , and if you do not count the greenhouse gas v@@ ap@@ our less effect than that of C@@ 2 , it is true that two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power station is in water ste@@ am and a little in the water . Ri@@ gh@@ tly so .
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a ‘ South Asian giant ’ … !
Last time , Pakistan won H@@ indu@@ stan .
I am not surprised by the fact that most of the Indi@@ ans who make comments do not want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan .
In fact , it shows your state of mind .
It would have been the same if they had described India as a giant of South Asia ...
I have nothing against Pakistani players participating , but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply be opening a P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box full of corruption and ma@@ fia .
As for the I@@ SL , today &apos;s opening match was surprisingly interesting , with the K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata Ath@@ le@@ tic with 3@@ 0 to M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
In comparison with the billions and billions that India spends on cr@@ ic@@ ket and now football , how can we possibly compete with our ‘ no@@ is@@ y neighbours ’ ...
The race for low-cost laun@@ cher will pay a price for cash .
It is a shame for such a beautiful project .
In the case of the incident , the possible lack of design only manife@@ sts itself with a h@@ é@@ li@@ um too cold .
We may not , therefore , be in a conception of design , but of implementation ...
Contrary to the fact that a private company is a private company , it seems that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as the state is its own insu@@ rer .
They may pay the fre@@ ak satell@@ ites who know .
It is all the more unfortunate that many media are taking over the articles only - and many read@@ ers are only holding these headlines .
All in all , this creates a false impression that is contrary to the content of the article itself .
Ab@@ solu@@ tely with you , the title is not appropriate , it is un@@ ju@@ stly calling into question the project when it is only a problem of the laun@@ ch@@ ment .
