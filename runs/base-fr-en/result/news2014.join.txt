Spectasar leap in &apos; walking &apos; above Bogota
The sport , Jhonathan Florez , has died on Thursday of a helicopter above Bogota , the Colombian capital .
Equipposed by a win-win ( a combination of aides ) , it went to 160 km / h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary , located at more than 3 000 metres of altitude , where many badges gathered to observe its feat .
A black box in your car ?
While the planners of the United States &apos; road network find it difficult to find the money needed to repair the self-decimitude infrastructure , many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the table of your car .
The appliances , which have all the miles travelled by an motorist and transmit information to officials , are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main American roads .
The sector generally without interest in the planning of major axes has suddenly caused a lively debate and turbulent alliances .
The libertarian groups have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use the small boxes to keep a trace of the miles you leave , and possibly the road to which you circulate , then to use the information to draft a tax bill .
The Tea Party is landed .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And while the members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
They are looking at how , over the next decade , they can switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes , sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system , for an experimental vice .
This is really essential for our nation .
&apos;It is not as if we had the choice &apos; , said Hasan Ikrata , Director-General of the Suthern California Association , who states that the state is starting to register the mirrors travelled by every single car driver by 2025 .
There will be change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Fund of the country , financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the pump , is financially dry .
The Americans no longer buy as much petrol as before .
Vehicles can travel more miles with a gallon .
The federal tax itself , which is 18.4 cents per gallon , has not increased for 20 years .
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax , even 1 % , while petrol prices are high .
&apos;The tax on petrol is simply not tenable &apos; , said Lee Munnich , a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota .
His state has recently installed traces of 500 cars to test a payment system in the mould .
&apos;This is the most logical long-term alternative &apos; .
Wonks calls for the use of a kilometer .
It is not surprising that the idea is seduced by the Liberals , as taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious state laws on global warming .
But the chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives has said that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
The supporters of the Foundation &apos;s free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay .
&apos;It is not just a tax on a large black hole &apos; , he declared Adrian Moore , the vice-president of the policy at the Reasson Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided to them .
The movement is also supported by two former US secretaries in transport , which , in a 2011 report , urged Congress to go down the path of payment .
The US Senate approved a pilot project of USD 90 million last year that would have brought about 10 000 cars .
But the presidency of the House has killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or to the city .
However , several states and large cities are making progress on their side .
The most determined is Oregon , which mobilised 5 000 drivers to lead the country &apos;s most important experiment .
These motorists will soon pay for the system of kilometric costs instead of taxes on petrol .
The Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
The city of New York envisages one .
The Illinois is trying to test a limited number of lorries .
And the I-95 Coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states extending the US coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) examines how it could implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the Nevada , where around 50 voluntary car drivers recently fitted their cars with a equipment , drivers were concerned that the government could follow their worst facts and gestures .
&apos;concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing is a big problem &apos; , said Alauddin Khan , who runs the strategic management of performance in the Department of Transport of Nevada .
That is not something that people want .
From the beginning of the trial , the ACLU in the Nevada warned on its site : &apos; It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into a proper localisation system &apos; .
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep the records of people &apos;s homes and daily arrivals .
The Nevada is one of the few states that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many mixes run a car , but without knowing the place or the time .
If you can do that , he added Khan , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-up start-up of California , the name of Traue Mileage .
Originally , society was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the Member States .
It sought to persevere in the emerging market of self-insurance , where drivers would pay for their kilometer .
However , the devices it teaches have planted the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information , periodically downloaded by motorm .
&apos;People will be more inclined to do that if you do not register their speed and do not locate them &apos; , said Ryan Morrison , Director General of Traue Milage .
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some states .
There are much cheaper means and much less intrusive methods of doing this .
In Oregon , planners are trying to experience their experience by offering car drivers different choices .
They can choose a device with or without GPS .
They can still choose not to have any apparatus at all , preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all the residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing equipment to do more , rather than enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for parking charges , provide a &apos; payment payment &apos; insurance and create a set of data on a real rate of speed from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion .
&apos;Automobists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them &apos; , a document on urban planning .
However , some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate about the payment of mine is simply a huge diverge .
In the Metropolitan Transit Commission of the San Francisco Bay area , those responsible say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on petrol .
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol , so that everyone pays their fair share .
&apos;There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin &apos; , said Mr RÃ©chler , the director of the law and public affairs in the committee .
If you do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about the protection of their privacy and about a lot of other things .
David Bowie :
The English musician has not come to an end this year .
From The Next Day , in January , he concocted a luxury reedition that was planned for 4 November , with a number of new ones .
Four have already emerged on the Tol .
The announcement of a new albulm of David Bowie left the whole of the panels .
On the day of its 66th birthday , on 8 January 2013 , he said that a new albulm would emerge in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last one , Reality , dates of 2003 ) and too few public appearances , the English musician proved that we could still count on him to bring the pop up .
A festive for its fans
Not as a result of surprises , David Bowie had more in his sack with The Next Day .
In this way , the Thin White Duke plans to reconstruct this allude on 4 November .
On the occasion he concocted a true festival for his fans .
This republication , entitled The Next Day Extra , will be presented in the form of three discs : the original album , unprecedented studio sessions and towers , as well as a DVD containing the four clips already uncovered .
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared with the original alpham : the three pieces of the Deluxx edition , five songs specially unveiled for the opportunity , and two towers .
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful coffin in a video .
It introduces both the record and the accessories provided with : exclusive photographs and potoons , a carnet to share his own impressions , a restatement with words ...
And , above all , it gives a foretaste of its new title Atomica , typically in the vein of The Next Day , with very strong guides and a rocky electricity .
Income
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal his arms .
The Informing , Like A Rock Man , Born In A UFO are also available on the web .
The Inform is in the dark : a worrying insider prior to a light cavalier that is gradually slowing down to leave a pop pop .
In Like A Rokt Man , did we want to make a small reference to the Rock Man of Elton John , or indeed to Great ?
With this title , the singer seems at least to be in his point when he has no feet on earth .
SPope Oddity , on the other hand , was much more serious .
On Born In A UFO , David Bowie again referred to his stranglehold : would he come from another planet ?
There is a desire to leave the earth .
In any case , we are in the process of playing a camera with these titles : an informal tower , a man on board a fuss , a Martian potential ...
It conceals and reveals both , plays a different personalities , as he has done throughout his career , especially with his figures Ziggy Stardust and Alonn Sana .
It is not surprising that he has a mask of hand in the photograph of the campaign in the Vyage , the brand Louis Vuitton , of which he embodies the new face .
It will appear in one of their advertisements , broadcast from 10 November .
The Minister of Defence , Rob Nicholson , insisted that the wounded soldiers were not routinely released from the Canadian Armed Forces , and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before returning to civil life .
Attached by Liberals and Democrats in the House of Commons , Mr Nicholson ensured that , before their release , the members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors .
All the injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life , and none of them is released before being ready , he said .
The critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the wounded military - who do not meet the rule of &apos; the universality of the service &apos; of the army demanding that staff be able to carry out a number of different tasks - to reach the 10 years required for pension provision .
In particular , they mentioned two cases reported by the Presse Canadians , including that of a soldier released last Friday .
Corporal David Hawkins , a London reservist , in Ontario , reached post-traumatic stress syndrome , has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year more so that he can receive a fully indexed pension .
His case came to light after that of Corporal Glen Kircia , who said before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before he was ready because he did not meet the universal rule of service .
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave , with plans and consultation sessions , but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said in a meeting with the Presse Canadians on Wednesday .
I asked for months if there was a way to stay , and they said no .
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has been struggling to determine which latitude it can give the injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks , but who are not able to fight .
Under the current rules , the seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented last year in Parliament indicate that , among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons , 199 had not reached the time required to obtain pension benefits .
The liberal spokesperson on former combatants , Jim Karygiannis , asked for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday , while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of &apos; this shameful practice &apos; .
Disney tablets to launch a series of animated series
The American media and entertainment group has decided to give the tablets to its own television channels for the next round of children .
The first nine episodes of Sheriff , Wild West , will be available from 24 November on the watchdisnyjunor.com site or via its application for telephones and tablets .
Its global launch on the Disney Group channels is only planned in 2014 , details of the communiquÃ© of its Disney Junior division .
The lively cartoon , intended for children of 2-7 years , tells the adventures of the Chatee Cally , sheriff of a city in the American west , where it puts the order in order with a magic lasso .
Every episode includes two 11 minutes .
&apos;Intervention with smarphphes and tablets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commended Albert Cheng , Vice-President for digital products at Disney / ABC Television Group , quoted in the communiquÃ© .
This kind of experience between the Disney efforts to &apos; expand the life of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important &apos; , has added .
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of the less than two years have already been used by a tablets or telephone , and 72 % of the less than 8 years , compared with 10 % and 38 % respectively .
Snowden is ready to &apos; cooperate &apos; with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden , the whistle-blowing of US intelligence services , said that he was prepared to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were not provided with answers on their activities .
The German Member Hans-Christian StÃ¶bele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he has the right of asylum , to discuss his testimony in Germany .
In a letter that the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr Snowden said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a flight and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . &apos;
However , telling the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against him .
As part of the complaint lodged by the US Department of Justice , he is accused of spying and theft of state goods .
Hans-Peter Friedrich , the German Interior Minister , said at Zeit Online : &apos; If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German officials , we will make sure that we do that . &apos;
Relations between the United States and Germany were put to a severe test following complaints that the NSA had been listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
Thomas Ophotn , the Member who heads the parliamentary group supervising the foreign secret services , said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &apos; without putting it at risk and completely ruining relations with the United States &apos; , we should take advantage of it .
Mr StraÃ¶bele , a German Green , published a photograph with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account .
When he visited Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr StraÃ¶bele said that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant , Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany , he would have to give him the assurance that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , said the Member .
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a &apos; serious and sustained &apos; persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global response to &apos; my act of political expression &apos; .
Citizens throughout the world , as well as the senior officials - including the United States - found that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility .
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Cogeco Cable could soon offer the interactive downstream
The subscribers of Cogeco Cable may well have access to applications such as Facebook , Twitter and ultimately the video service on the demand for Netanyahu via their television in a future that is not so far away .
The subsidiary of Cogeco indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of this platform of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces , as well as more options &apos; , explained the President and head of the management of Cogeco , Louis Audet .
In this way , Cogeco Cable is following up to its competitors , such as Belll , even though the subsidiary of Cogeco has not yet had a precise date for this new platform .
&apos;We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail &apos; .
The ultimate aim is still to provide tools to which our customers do not currently have access .
The telecoms giant Rogers has already indicated that he could offer Netanyahu if some technical details , which have not been mentioned , could be solved .
In the United States , the television service says that it is in discussions with some major cages so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
The p.be.g. de Cogeco and Cogeco CÃ¢able also welcomed the announcement by the Harper Government in its Trojine speech on 16 October .
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the card services .
&apos;It is about two and a half years ago that we are saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains , that is not working &apos; , has said Mr Audet .
However , it hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Telecommunications and Telecommunications Council ( CRTC ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;He will have to emerge from these discussions a new frame of reference for defining our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television &apos; , said the p.C. de Cogeco .
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring .
On the side of the results , Cogeco indicated that there was a net benefit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 .
This is a step backwards compared with the net benefit of 44.9 million , or 83 % per action , of the same period last year .
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by means of amortization costs linked to new acquisitions .
In 2012 , Cogeco acquired the Blanc Broadband cable , established in the United States , for 1.36 billion .
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal .
Last December , it also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprise , an Internet supplier established in Vancouver , for the sum of 526 million .
As for Cogeco &apos;s revenue , they grew 41.5 % in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million .
They are EUR 1.8 billion .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Cogeco Cable , was 43.9 million , or 90 % per action , in retrospect compared with the 45.7 million , or 93 .
However , the revenue from Cogeco Cable has increased by 45 % to EUR 470.4 million .
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter .
However , for the financial year 2013 , the number of customers in Cogeco Cable is 5546 .
Mr Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating in this way .
For me , it is not the indication of a change of trend , he has observed .
It varies from one quarter to the other with very strong competition .
From the horse to beef
Short meat has been found in bovine canned boxes , sold by two small , low-price British professors , announced today the food hygiene agency .
Practical tests have revealed that products , drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the Homeland and Quality Save chains , were contained in the DNA DNA of a maximum of 1 to 5 % .
&apos;Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the British agency .
A scandal of the presence of horses in kick-beats broke in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests in Ireland .
According to European Commission examinations , France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that were supposed to contain only beef .
A collision between two vehicles resulted in four injured , early on Friday , on road 131 , in LanaudiÃ¨re .
Shortly before 4th , a motorist who was circulating in the north , in Saint-Felide de Valis , lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured , but there was no fear for their lives .
The traffic was returned to normal to 6th , Friday .
Frontier Airlines
Frontier Airlines plans to make up to $ 100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights .
Frontier Airlines plan to start making up to $ 100 for a hand-baggage and $ 2 for a coffee or a soda , although in its announcement on Wednesday , it indicated that passengers could take the unopened cane with them to the flight .
The new baggage costs concern bags in the upper compartment , so the small bags in the seat will always be free .
Frontier said that it would pay $ 25 if the costs were paid in advance and $ 100 if the travellers were only paid once on board .
The Frontier spokesman , Kate O &apos;Malley pointed out that the USD 100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance .
&apos;We do not want to pay that price &apos; , she explained .
Airlines have started to make the first and second luggage recorded in 2008 .
Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in their hand luggage in higher compartments , so there was often no room for them in these compartments .
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board .
They said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a matter of making the customers of Frontier Borders understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the superior compartments .
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger in a boarding boy could transport a bag free of charge , while the next person in the queue could have to pay USD 100 for a similar bag .
It has explained that the site and the border registration procedures are changing in order to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they reach the door .
Border luggage costs will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Passengers often run on baggage and other charges , but the airlines are admitting them .
They believe that the costs of handling baggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it .
Many people in Wall Street regard the addition of baggage charges as a sign that the airlines are paying enough for the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them have not touched on baggage costs .
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand baggage costs three years ago , and the Low-coat company was followed a little later .
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air , which has declared the consultant to the airlines of Jy Sorensen , which is closely following the costs .
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that Spirit &apos;s hand-baggage costs were USD 50 per year .
Sorensen , a former framework in Midwest Airlines , recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what it was going to find at the boarding door at a time when passengers would discover the unaccustomed hand-outs imposed by the company .
&apos;I had never seen a boarding procedure so fluid in all my professional career &apos; .
I was expecting some teeth and baggage to burst .
The aeroplane was full , he added , &apos; the passengers were on board at the speed of clarity &apos; .
Borders also do like Spirit and apply costs of USD 2 for a coffee , a tha , a soda or a fruit juice .
Frontier has indicated that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can take the unopen cane with them , and those who take coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
US Airways made a short attempt to make drinks pay in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline had followed .
The Frontier decision to make baggage fees pay when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is the last effort to encourage customers to go on their website .
The airlines pay for online travel vendors like Orbiz $ 10 to $ 25 for every ticket sold .
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of talking to an online travel agency .
However , Frontier went further in this area .
In September , it began to offer only half of the loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it reduced the number of mixes by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a Frontier 1000 mile trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Borders site .
Borders have a true client in its home town , Denver , but its activity is declining and is losing money .
The revenue has fallen by 9 % and its flight capacity has fallen by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its mother company , Public Airways Holdings Inc .
Republic has tried to redress Frontier finances by selling the airline .
The NSA
The National Security Agency , working in the shadows , said on Friday that it was a bug that caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , and not hacklers as some had claimed online .
&apos;NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a planned update &apos; , indicated the spying agency in a statement by email .
The problem will be solved this evening .
The allegations that the breakdown was due to an attack on the denial of service is false .
Earlier this evening , the online servers of online servers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
Earlier , a NSA spokesman indicated to ABC News that the agency &apos;s sensitive internal network was not a compromise at all .
No classified information is at risk , explained the spokesman .
At least a group of online hacktivists has claimed to be responsible for the PSA &apos;s breakdown with a DSD attack .
The DSD attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system .
The NSA used to be a secret secret , a time called the &apos; No Such Agency &apos; , has found itself under the spotlight and strongly criticised in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programmes at national and foreign level - which are part of the NSA secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former disillusioned consultant of the NSA , Edward Snowden .
This growing controversy around the agency has caused a lot of speculation that this evening &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation .
The Delta Center now closed
The Delta Cen-Ville hotel closed on Thursday in Montreal , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that had the edifice sold it to promoters who will turn it into a student house .
Three hundred and fifty people worked in hotel .
Of these , 200 have still not found new jobs .
Delta promises not to let his employees fall .
Employers have come to meet with employees directly on the ground , they have met the employees individually to assess their needs .
&apos;This will continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the Hotel Delta , Felix Bson .
The closure of the Delta comes in a very competitive hotel market .
The investment fund that was the owner of that building had a choice to make .
Either he reinvested in building to continue to operate , so there were tens of millions of investments when competition is very fierce , there are many new hotels who appeared in Montreal .
&apos;Either either he or she would sell it to someone else , and that is what happened &apos; , explains Paul Arsenult , the holder of the tourism tourism company Transat to the EQAM AIC .
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted into the next few months , such as the Point Plaza , which will become a residence for the elderly .
In the meantime , four hotel projects with almost 600 chambers will be established within two years .
For the CEO of Titan , &apos; Gooddar Amiens &apos; purchasing project is starting with zero employees &apos; .
Having thrown the issue together in January for the partial resumption of the Goodear site promised to close , Mauritius Taylor , the CEO of the American Plenary Titan , is now prepared to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 of the plant .
Arnaud Monteburg , the Minister for productive recovery , had already announced this , on Monday , 21 October .
Having given up the plant &apos;s purchase project in January , you are now returning .
You made violent attacks and insults , talking about &apos; so-called workers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; mad trade unions &apos; , with the CGT .
This is not understood .
Is it to please Mr Monteburg ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Save my wife .
Mr Monteburg , is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
I am sorry to have been wounded by someone .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Is the truth ?
Working seven hours a day when other countries are working eight hours hampers France .
In India , China and the rest of other countries , 10 to 12 hours a day are being employed .
But I have no prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tyres , has good equipment , is well situated and has space to grow .
Why is it so necessary for the plant ?
There is no need to buy this plant .
But , with the right price and the competent workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodedar ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Goodedar had given employees a good start , I think 100 % of the employees would have accepted it .
Now let us imagine that Titan is buying Goodedar the closed plant .
Therefore , Titan could move the machinery to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency .
I think Mr Monteburg knows that .
He wants to keep the factory in Amine with at least 333 well-paid jobs .
Totan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1 200 current Goodedar employees .
Therefore , Mr Monteburg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to bring the CGT to the table with Goodedar .
The first step is that the CGT and Goodedar are seizing an agreement on starting allowances for all employees .
Then there will be no more employees in the plant .
Mr Monteburg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm that ?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333 .
I know he would like a four-year guarantee .
But , as I have said , the CGT and Goodedar must first agree on starting allowances .
If all employees accept them , the plant &apos;s purchase project is starting with zero .
How can we give guarantees of working time when there are no longer any employees on the site ?
If Mr Monteburg succeeds in ensuring that the CGT and Goodedar come to an agreement and that Titan is buying the plant , then we intend to stay in Amixed North over four years .
The benefit of Bomardier is falling , while the deliveries and orders of aeroplanes go back and go backwards .
Bomardier Inc , the Canadian aeronautical and rail builder , pointed out a 15 % fall in its net benefit on Thursday , under pressure from a reduction in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains .
Bomardier , based in Montreal , has also not provided any flight test data for his or her new aeroplane , CSeries , or information to know whether the aeroplane will meet its ambitious schedule for commercial service until September .
After the air plane &apos;s inaugural flight around a month and a half ago , it only stolen three times , and the question then asked whether the test phase was on the right track .
The results have not been up to the forecasts and the course of action has fallen by 8 % to the Toronto Exchange .
Camon Doerksen , an analyst in the National Bank of Financial Bank , lowered his rating , from &apos; overperformance &apos; to &apos; industry performance &apos; , because of the low potential for increasing the stock market in the next quarter or two quarters .
&apos;Although the reduction in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transitional division &apos; , said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers .
We believe that Bomardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test programme advances .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
Bomboring hopes that the family of the Serb aircraft will be able to catapult in the lower segment of a market that is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
The first test aeroplane was unveiled in March and was first in September after months of delay .
However , the number of firm orders for the Serb aircraft is modest up to 177 , and it seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the claims of society regarding energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new online aircraft .
At the moment , society has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchasing commitments from 15 customers and operators .
Pierre Beauaun , President and head of the management , is convinced that Bomardier will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the first aeroplane is used .
The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was progressing according to the timetable .
&apos;The test aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than expected &apos; , said Mr Beauaun at a telephone conference , adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the flight time .
Each manufacturer is planning differently .
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and to provide for an update period , and that is what we have done .
This will happen throughout the flight programme .
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks , the others will follow shortly afterwards , which has indicated society .
Yet analysts are sceptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aeroplane only 12 months after his inaugural flight .
Bomardier has indicated that it is assessing the timetable for entry and will provide new information in the coming months .
&apos;This slowness of trial on the flight - although it is apparently in line with the internal calendar of Bomardier - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015 &apos; , said Mr Doerksen .
In the third quarter , on 30 September , the net benefit of Bomardier fell to USD 147 m , or 8 cents per action , compared with 172 M , or 9 cents per year .
The result of adjusted action has remained unchanged at 9 cents .
incomes have fallen slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 Mdollars .
The analysts expected a result of 10 cents per action and revenue from USD 4.56 , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth aeronautical manufacturer in the world indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , compared with 57 a year earlier .
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft , compared with 83 before .
The delay in the Aeronautical division was 32.9 Mfrom to 30 September , a figure that is unchanged on 31 December of the previous year .
&apos;In Aeronautical , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing &apos; .
Aeronautical incomes have fallen by 13 % to USD 2 Mdollars .
Bomardier , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , has said that the income of this division has increased by nearly 11 % to USD 2.1 .
The orders for the Transit division total 32.6 Mfrom to 30 September , which is a slight increase compared with 31 December of the previous year .
The margins of the Transit division have suffered problems of execution with regard to some large contracts .
The leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter .
The course of Bomardier &apos;s actions , which also announced that Patrick Pichette , head of the financial management of Google Inc , would sit on the board , fell from 8.5 % to USD 4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazilian society , the third aeronautical manufacturer in the world and the nearest competitor in Bomardier , indicated on Thursday a 10 % drop in its quarterly benefit .
Two swaelecologists of 23 and 27 years were missing in a chasm under the Death of Class since Thursday evening , we have learned on Friday at the SPeleclio rescue of the Island .
They were located on the Friday afternoon .
The two men , who have been in practice in practice and the other no , were left on Thursday at 9.30 p.m. to carry out a crossing of the Date of Class , located on the St Pierre de Charrante .
Then there was no news from them since then .
&apos;The spageologists should have come up at around 5th of the morning &apos; , said Thierry Larrebe , technical adviser to the SPeleclio rescue aid .
Tens of people on the ground
There were two dozen rescue workers , ten civilians from the French SpÃ©lio rescue , as well as policemen , CRS and fire brigades .
At the end of the afternoon this Friday , the two swageologists were localised .
&apos;It is another group of shoeologists who , after having found their way out but healthy in the cavity , sent information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network &apos; explains the Dauphorus .
The two military in the 13th battalon of ChabÃ©ry &apos;s AlphÃ©ry , were found &apos; exhausted , but not injured &apos; .
They lost out in the network , returned to their steps while waiting for relief , made the prefecture clear .
Confusted , they should come out of hand with the help of rescue workers in the evening .
German journalists
The German journalists &apos; union invited its members on Thursday to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo after further revelations about the activities of US and British intelligence services .
&apos;The German Federation of Journalists recommends to journalists that they should not be able to use the search engines and messengers of Google and Yahoo &apos; , says in a statement .
It considers the information from Washington Post to be &apos; scandalous &apos; , according to which the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) and the United Kingdom &apos;s Headquarters Headquarters ( GCHQ ) have collected information masses by infiltrating international networks that allow both companies to synchronise their servers .
&apos;Research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &apos; , added Michael Konken , the Chairman of the trade union , who claimed 38,000 members .
Fine : a Member requests the resignation of Brigite Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels of &apos; connecting &apos; poles of traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone .
As a point of order , the Brussels Minister of the Labour and Transport Service launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project of repainting 16 poles of traffic lights in the region to the yellow and blue colours of Brussels .
The aim is both &apos; to increase security &apos; and &apos; Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long term , to paint all the traffic lights in Brussels at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
However , the blue chosen by the Minister is &apos; too much &apos; , according to the Brussels Member of Brussels , Emmanuel De Bock , who talks about &apos; Flemish &apos; in the capital and demands the &apos; resignation &apos; of Brigite Grouwels .
&apos;No content to spend the money of Brussels &apos; money on a tack of pote-pooling poles in the Brussels region , Brigitte Grouwels continues to carry out the fire of the Capital of Capital &apos; .
After his jailing taxis , she has finally repainted the poles in Brussels .
According to the honourable Member , there is now no &apos; no longer a difference of visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels &apos; .
Brussels deserves better than to see their money squandered by a CD &amp; V minister who is itself carrying out the NVA programme .
It is high time to stop Flanders .
&apos;A point of order , Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes to 0.5 % of Brussels &apos; .
Pont-de-Buis pork
The Pont-de--Buis ecotax , around which there was a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax on Saturday , was removed on Thursday morning .
Progress has been made shortly after 10 hours , and the circulation of national traffic has been hijacked .
The decision on decommissioning , announced by the prefecture of the FinisÃ¨re on Wednesday , was taken by the company Ecomv , the pig manager .
It is the last of the three current ecolabetes in the Department of the FinisÃ¨re , the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged .
Lessons of an accessory to Google Glass
A online shop , offering a multitude of accessories to Google Glass , has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of the connected glasses signed Google .
They can thus acquire an wielder , a charger or even an old one .
This sludge , which is strictly reserved for developers already with Glass Glass , proposes a few by-products such as a charger and cable USB , for $ 50 .
For the same price , it is also possible to acquire a wave of protection made in micro-fibres or an intrariar wider .
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass , fitted with correction verses , no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed .
Five years ago , my father lost out from the world of living .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking about him now , and I was talking about him .
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to &apos; attend &apos; .
There is no recipe , no way of employment to cross the wall of invisible and to find its own .
Then there were signs .
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving .
Another time , a double awakening in the middle of the night to look at his shows that no longer leaves me at night .
It is the image of my sister father who accompanies me in my daily gestures .
Our mother left us after his exhausting fight against cancer .
This is at least what I thought of the day when I found its empty body , crying on this hospital bed to bred flags .
Similarly , its funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the meagre luggage of the tanks .
I thought it was a part .
Shortly , by little ballot boxes or nocturnal events , a little timid , a bit erroneous , she quickly returned to my mind , changing as she took her place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in mourning .
And then it turned out to be very close to my own facets that I had not yet seen , disgusted by my relationship .
I have therefore learned and understood that I have not lost the person of my mother , but simply a woman that I was not really familiar with , a woman who embodied that person during his life in life .
In dying , this woman had a perfect life and released the person I love , and now I was there , full and full .
This is the most unexpected and beautiful way of life .
It is a privilege to know that the loved people never leave .
I look to my father , &apos; both inside and outside &apos; .
I have always been told .
I never believed it at that time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , ill .
I was not afraid of him , and I was able to love him .
One day he died .
He went to me for a long time : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I had a bad ...
He spoke to me and was constantly encouraged , he was living my body .
I saw his hands looking at mine , I was a body .
But that was never the case .
I was able to have a personal life .
He left me intimate .
It lasted for a long time and one day .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged and advised .
I no longer know who said that people who died are not forgotten but invisible .
My parents are no longer , but I feel them constantly .
Every event , every moment in my life , makes me feel their presence because I am always referring to it : what have they said ?
I constantly dream of them , perhaps not all nights but several times a week .
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this .
I am often anguish when it comes to me and I deeply feel their absence .
Sometimes , some dreams are on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed they continue to live and share my life .
On the eve of my maxim in which I had to know the sex of my baby , I dreamed that I would wake up , I was out of the bed , my father was waiting for me on her patchwork , and I was very pleased that I was waiting for a little boy .
The next day , I had the feeling that he visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what happened .
And of course , it was a small boy in my seller .
I wanted to share this moment with him , and I am pleased to say that common memory lived after his death .
Five years ago , my grandmother died as a result of cancer .
A year ago , she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
That is the shock that his demise caused in the young breath that I was at the time .
However , I have achieved my mourning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , especially at times when I find myself in difficulty , or when I have to take important decisions .
Avoiding the Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East , to the point of making it a mate in a great school , has not , with hindsight , been in any way anodine choices .
In fact , I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood , and talk about Morocco , where it had lived for decades , before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values she has charged to me are still present , so I think I think how she would like me to act at some point .
The same goes for my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and the righteousness of the spirit that was a fervent believer .
Now I feel it is a daily presence , a benevolent soul , a salvage spirit .
I see his views on me .
My mother died 19 years ago .
Morte has spoken to me on the telephone .
I have gone through all the phases : incomprehension , anger , pain , the cracks that are going on alone , anywhere , anywhere , in insolvent places , are incongruous times .
Then the time has appeased .
It was only the lack , this unanswered vacuum , that need and the need for me , to reassure me that it is soft .
Yet it is there , there is a silent presence , it is there and I am looking at it .
All the morning , I see his concern about me , I see the rings that are weighing up his eyes , the rallies around the lips that cigarettes are growing , the cracks that mark the day of concern .
My mother took up my face and she looked at me every morning in my mirror .
And every morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer to 43 years .
There is a constant sense of protection , and nothing serious can happen .
It was his promise on his pain bed , then you were gradually relearned to smile , and to say his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I am talking to him at night when the absence is doing too badly , she invites me in my dreams when morale is a little .
We feel that we are being protected and protected in difficult times , and the time has come for us to see how it was the head of orchestra and we are trying to stay on the path it has outlined .
If one was very much like you , the absence could not grub you from heart and memories .
In a way , it is to be hoped for your internal energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I have always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated .
I was not able to attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death , I was given a little boy .
If I have my personal convictions , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision .
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , I am not going to do so and I still wonder what will happen .
I do not know whether I have adopted its way or whether I am simply like it : is it genetic ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a alter-ego , there was no need to talk between us .
In short , it is on a daily basis .
I feel his presence and I am pleased about that .
It is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33 .
I had 28 years and our son 6 years .
The huge penalty that then invaded me was , of course , mitigated , but it is still close to me .
Very often he &apos; lanes &apos; in my dreams in such a precise , so vivid way that I am even more sad to see that this was only a dream .
On the other night , he asked me whether I was going to go well , I told him no , he said &apos; I descend &apos; , but with such a real voice that I woke up , anguish , and fed the chorus of horses by watching everywhere , convinced that it was going to happen .
I always live in the same house , and often I feel that I have been watching to see if he is not here , I know he is he and I am talking to him .
In all the pieces I feel his presence and I am pleased to see that .
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and the spirit lives with me .
I have been 58 years old , I have always lived alone from his departure , he is and will remain love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am socialized with a profession of responsibility , I am , I am a grandmother , I am a grandmother , I am full of friends , but my heart and soul belong to him and I never speak with him except with my son , and I am never going to cemetery .
Iraq : October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008 .
Baghdad published official figures this Friday : 964 people died last month : 855 civilians , 65 policemen and 44 soldiers .
This publication takes place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President .
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States .
&apos;We do not say to the world that we are on our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , said al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington .
And also because , if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved , it will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also expand .
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives ?
Noury al-Maliki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
Outside the building , demonstrators were protesting against the Iraqi leader .
They were branding the blame for being a murderer and calling on the US to refuse to provide aid .
The cocaine lawyer who has informed a drug park of a police investigation has been imprisoned .
Bastharat Ditta , 42 years , provided information to the Neil Scarrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was revealed to the great day .
He was sentenced to a prison sentence of three years by the Court of Liverpool in Liverpool
A great defence lawyer , who had informed a drug park of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Bastharat Ditta , 42 years ago , gave sensitive information to the Neil Scarrough Archlord on investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine .
The lawyer , who was named &apos; Basth &apos; and considered by criminals as an &apos; important dossier &apos; , was arrested at home in 2011 as a result of police listening operations to Scarborough , which he represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials have returned to Sarborough , 32 years , in the process of tabling three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn , in Lancashire , when he was at a dinner dinner with colleagues .
Surveys have revealed that Ditta was a &apos; regular consumer &apos; of this class-class drugs , after tests showed cocaine traces in their hair , portfolio and credit cards .
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for Scarborough and one of his associates .
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Lancshire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
Together with 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1.5 M , as well as more than GBP 200 000 in a series of raids .
Tutta , 42 years ago , provided information to the criminals because it was feared that its drug dependence would be revealed .
Today , at the Court of Liverpool , Ditta , which is working in the cabinet of Forbes Solidarity in Blackburn , has fallen into disquiet after having been convicted of two charges of charges against justice after a three-week trial .
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating Scarborough , discovered that he had been in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .
Two investigators have followed the suspect and returned to the home of Ditta and placing drugs , which is no more than 60 % , under the banner of the lawyer in a black golf .
Shortly after the deposit , Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta , who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium , pregnant in the Blinkburn Roto club .
The lawyer is back home , he has discovered drugs and they have been using nine times .
The court has heard that Ditta was a &apos; regular consumer &apos; of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class-class drugs in his hair , portfolio and credit cards .
Tutta was arrested later , but denied the use of cocaine ; he said he had spoken about alleged trafficking in drugs because he was his client and said that their discussions were subject to a &apos; legal privilege &apos; .
During his arrest , Ditta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw a number of credit cards , but they were all seized and they were taken from a hair sample .
At a interrogation he said he had an office at his home , as well as at his workplace , and that he would get customers to call him for legal matters .
But the court has heard testimonies that he called major players in the drugs trade , some of whom he represented , after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew .
The Chief Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : &apos; If anyone should know that you should not violate the law , it is a criminal lawyer &apos; .
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer , and of having been too involved in particular customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking , but a drug trafficking that provides drugs to its own lawyer .
Some of its communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer .
But it went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client .
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Ditta did not honour his profession , but he was dishonoured .
It has been too close to some customers , especially Scarborough , and has allowed its independence to be compromised .
Ditta denied any illegal annoyance and said : &apos; If I were a corrupt lawyer , I am not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough , I would not have waited for 15 hours , I would have done so immediately . &apos;
However , after the hearing , the supervised Lee Halstead de the Lahshire Police said : &apos; Mr Ditta has gone from a criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started to obtain drugs from criminal organisations &apos; .
His addiction to cocaine has been a compromise for ever and has made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leaders of organised criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining valuable information about police investigations .
Lawyers should observe the highest integrity rules and create a climate of confidence in the public .
Mr Ditta has betrayed this confidence and tried to hide behind the virtues of his profession .
The serious and organised crime unit in Lancashire carried out the investigation into Mr Ditta , who was convicted of the three charges of charge of cocaine and now obstructing justice , demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminal criminals .
It should be a warning to criminals that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts .
Scarborough was himself imprisoned for 14 years after he was guilty of complicity in the complicity of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
Thirty-five others involved in traffic have been sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drugs trafficking .
On his site , Ditta organized a sitting of questions and answers on himself in which he said that his dream of dream would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the death row in America , his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work .

The cost of its Christmas illuminations
There are 420 reasons , 2.2 kilometres from the sea of the sea , which is covered by a mantle of light : we could be cheating the hod in Mmenton with the bill of illuminations .
Coming which , unlike many municipalities , is more and more regulated by taxpayers , not by traders &apos; associations .
In order to reduce costs , the city is using leaps .
But there is also a differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations .

Classification for teenagers
Each time it is the school customer that will be targeted , an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season .
Through five Sayntes imagined and interpreted by artists in the region , sticks with a high dose of humour , we are allowing teenagers to be able to learn the classical old .
In addition to this spectacle , the Kingdom &apos;s lyrical art Society will return with its lyrical Desnations , a formula that is now filled with the Pulpery in Chikstimi .
Two further concerts will take place in summer 2014 , giving artists in the region a chance to show what they are capable of .
In these activities , the lyrical Appendix , which was held last August , was added , with the help of the coloriature coloriature Marie-Eve Muner .
It was an activity-benefit , along with the artistic dimension , and it helped the not-for-profit body to produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft on ears as an air in the mouse .
Without giving precise figures , the President of the Board of Directors , Yves Bergeron , took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday , in Chikstimi , to be reassuring .
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions , the future is developing well , even in the long term .
We have more solid and constant support .
&apos;Finance is afloat and we hope to continue until the 50th anniversary of the opera , a step we will take in seven years &apos; , has started the administrator .
&apos;I would even go beyond &apos; , added the Director-General , HÃ©lÃ¨ne Gaudult , by smiling .
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School of Surrey is facing six charges , according to the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada .
Omar Mousthea Hassan has been accused of taking hostage , sealing , threatening threats , port of weapon in a dangerous , kidnapping , and failing to comply with an order .
&apos;The rapid reaction of the policemen involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the security conclusion of this incident &apos; , declared the Corporal Bert Pquet by way of communiquÃ© .
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to come to court on Friday .
New demand for collective redress against the Saint-Cirs
A new request for collective redress has been lodged against the Saint-Cirt brothers , with regard to sexual assaults that took place this time in the St Joseph oratory and in several orphanages , colleges and schools .
The request is based on the testimony of the shark , identified as &apos; J. I &apos; , who would have been masqueraded in the 1950s , first of all in Ninee-des-Neilges by his professor , the Sayed brother , and then by his colleague , Father Bernard , at the St Joseph oratory , where he was used as a mass and where his father worked as a painter .
The first resort was only three institutions , and when the regulation was announced , many people told us : &apos; I was in that place , I can register &apos; , says the lawyer Alain Arsenult , who defends the victims in both cases .
The collective redress that has just been tabled is a special one to allow complainants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been carried out by members of the Holy Crot .
At the moment , the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Saint-Ccross brothers .
The alleged facts are usually older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the institutions that were targeted were closed in the 1960s .
The appeal also emphasises that the establishment of the Saint-Crot and the Holy Joseph oratory , which is a separate entity , &apos; allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &apos; , that they &apos; had a moral , religious and psychological constraint on the victims &apos; , that they were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless stifled them &apos; , and that they have consciously and consciously chosen to ignore the issue .
The latest accusations are based , among other things , on letters drawn up by the lawyer of the Saint-Crhea brothers , Me Emil Perdriin , in the 1990s , but also by the research into the archives on this subject by the brother Wilson Kennedy , a former brother of Saint Crot who publicly denounced the abuse .
Collective redress must first pass the stage of admissibility in the upper court .
Once the Court &apos;s admissibility is accepted , the second stage is to be taken , or the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first resort , the consultancy of the Holy Ccross agreed to settle amicably before hearings were held on the substance .
A fire in trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the rounder of LaSalle , in Montreal , on Thursday at Friday .
The aid was called to 1th , Friday , because of a fire that had declared itself to be the subsoil of an Indian kitchen restaurant on the Dolard avenue , near the intersection with the street .
The 30 fire brigades that were sent on the scene took almost an hour to control it .
The fire &apos; caused major damage to the structure of the building &apos; has indicated the head of the Montreal fire safety service , Richard Bordeaux .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in the restaurant when the fire brigades arrived .
There was no wounded , but almost 20 houses , located in the first and second parts of this side of commercial premises , had to be evacuated .
The Red Cross has been requested , because the residents of one flats may have to be temporarily temporary , referred to the SEM .
Many opposition to medical aid to die in Congress of palliative care
The Canadian Congress of palliative care , which is taking place this week in Ottawa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec .
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to appease their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would like to end their days , according to a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Ppalliatives , Maryse Bopen .
If we focus on palliative care in Canada , the approach of euthanasia would become minimal .
The President of the Quebec Package also rejects the draft law on medical aid .
If it is adopted , Alberte DÃ©ry is worried about the consequences for the next generations .
&apos;What is the meaning of life &apos; ?
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die , according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of Ppalliatives , Suzanine Fitzback .
Mrs Fitzback , who is also the director of the house Mathie-Francis in Gatiwater , believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway .
We never ask : &apos; I want to die , give me an injection &apos; .
The Director of the United Nations Planning Association , Rick Faith , believes that the Quebec bill is disorientating the population about the vocation of palliative care .
He does not believe that the Ontario will follow .
For its part , the liberal Member of Gatinwater , Sttephania VallÃ©s , says that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Kenyan press
&apos;It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question : what will prevent Parliament from wiping out the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? &apos; , said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional .
&apos;This law is draconian and very punitive , and we reject it &apos; , explained Cyrus Kamu , Director-General of Capital Group - the owner of CapittalFM , one of the most respected independent radio stations and websites in Kenya .
He pointed out that the new media court will always be one-sided because it is an extension of the government , and restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&apos;I hope that the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the Members &apos; , he added .
According to the newspaper The Star , the new draft law will allow the government to &apos; hold on the media &apos; . The Standard has , on the other hand , indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &apos; had suffered a hard blow &apos; and rocked the bill as &apos; draconian &apos; .
The adoption of the draft law comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the commercial centre of Westgate last September .
The Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by disseminating pictures of video-cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing the luxury centre .
The head of the police , David Kimaiyo , responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them , even though the call was withdrawn as a result of the lifting of clichers in the media .
Under the new draft law , the media may be punishable by fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &apos; radiated &apos; or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation .
The court also has the power to seize the goods of a offenders if it has not paid a fine .
According to the Daily Nation , &apos; even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations &apos; .
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the &apos; lively blogosphere &apos; in Kenya .
By reducing the media , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
&apos;Nobody will never know &apos; , wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist in The Nation , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life .
&apos;Living for themselves , politicians would put the country into bankruptcy and would bring us back to hunting and cooling &apos; .
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the national wage committee and reinstated their mighty wages of around 532 000 shillings per month tax-free , which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Health and Social Services Centre ( SSS ) from Laval caused a whole host to the leadership of the CHealth Hospital in the year 2012-2013 .
As a result of multiple retirement , maternity leave or departures , the Pharmacist department has found itself seriously deficient .
There was almost 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , according to the head of the department , Gillian Beaudand .
However , the SSS has decided not to engage in an independent workforce , which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist .
There was no use of the breakdown , Mrs Beaudet explained .
Some of our activities have been streamlined or reduced within the establishment of the patchwork , the time that things are getting back .
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people &#91; residents in pharmacies &#93; to come and stay here .
There is a combination of circumstances that have led to a bad situation last year .
Improved improvement
After this difficult period , the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the SSS Package department .
Already , three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been recruited in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to hold back have borne fruit , because the four pupils who are under house arrest in Laval have also decided to remain in the SSS .
Now it is much better , has highlighted the pharmacist .
By the end of the financial year we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns .
This will therefore fill our departures from last year .
Less ever ?
However , the situation remains delicate .
Several factors , such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or the predominance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because there is a young environment , and many young women are employed , therefore with pregnancies , almost always three maternity leave , when it goes well , has added .
In the last year we have had much more and there is no pharmacists who are available to make replace , so it was more difficult .
The top mop of 22 years does not start his career in the cinema by the back door .
The director Lars von Try chose to embody Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomiac , his next film .
This across-the-board pornographic drama , in eight chapters that will come into two parts ( 1 and 8 January 2014 ) , the erotic memories of a quadraire quadraire since her teenage .
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with his elicit is striking : a blente of blender , a diversion and the Franco-British origins .
Without forgetting the risk of a certain risk : the one that had not hesitated to sneak on glossy paper is going to be seen in much more sulphurous situations .
A Nymhomiac extradite has raised the temperature on the Tol : Stacy Martin appears to be in the bed and in full excitement with Shia LaBeouf .
If the provocative filter has asked its actors to put their punishments on the shelf , it has resorted to professionals from X to the most odious scenes , before merging all the numerical bodies : above the belt , it is the star ; below , the dwindling .
From BjÃ¶rk to Charlotte Gainsburg , to Nicole Kidman , Lars von Trier is used to pushing his crackers into their last tranches , always for the best .
State Martin has not finished talking about it .
A CGR room in Narright
On Thursday evening , the first sitting of a film was suspended in the Meia CGNR of Narbon , with a precautionary measure , as a result of paperwork of the spectators .
Immediately , the Director of the establishment has done the evacuation of the Chamber and warned the fire brigade for a suspect smell .
Some 70 people have come out of the sitting .
People have been examined and there has been a complete recognition of the room .
Might I joke at the bottom of the tear jet ?
Or an unintentional incident ?
However , the leadership of the cinema has been the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers .
The room was axed and everything returned .
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and customers find the pleasure of the images .
Only on screen .
It attempts to import 2 kg of cocaine into icks
Taking advantage of the Halween Day , a woman tried to get two kilograms of cocaine in the country , on Thursday morning , at the Montreal-Trupresent airport .
It is when we look at the bags that drugs have been detected .
The cocaine had been distributed in three cicks which had previously been transferred .
Drugs were then transported to the Office of the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada ( GRC ) which took over in this investigation .
Canada &apos;s border services agency ( SAFC ) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted .
This was part of the investigation , which indicated that Jacquein Robly was spokesman for the SAFC .
What I can tell you is that it came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border services at the Montreal-Trupresent airport have carried out 173 seizures of drugs , including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms .
In 2012 , the border service officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of drugs .
Air in Syria
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A short of SA-8 cargo cargo would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new raid of the TSahal aviation in Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz ) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor by Syria .
The raid took place in almost identical circumstances to the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed in CNN an Israeli attack , which was , this time , aimed at the Yakha solar missiles delivered by Russia in Damascus .
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine
The rating agency Standard &amp; Poorse lowered the creditworthiness of Ukraine on Friday , questioning the capacity of the former Soviet republic , in recession for more than a year , to face up to its financial obligations .
The note of the country &apos;s public debt titles goes to &apos; B- &apos; , which is sinking into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative perspective , and S &amp; P sees at least one chance in three that it will be reduced again within a year .
&apos;It is less and less likely that the government &apos;s strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs &apos; , explains the US agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine &apos;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue .
This complicates the repayment of credit from abroad .
These reserves , to which the authorities have a massive recourse to support the local currency , hryvnia , collapsing , the agency is increasingly likely to be devaluation , which would increase its external debt .
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle gas imports to Russia , which accuse it of not paying a bill of USD 882 million .
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of deep tension with its Russian neighbour , furious about Kiev &apos;s desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy suffered from July and September its fifth quarter of contraction .
Its debt , which is still relatively modest , has exploded in recent years and S &amp; D estimated at 3.5 % of GDP , compared with less than 10 % before the 2008-2009 crisis .
The country , in the budget deficit , has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months , which had given it a USD 15.3 billion credit in 2010 and has only released EUR 3.4 billion .
However , the fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , particularly by increasing gas prices to the population .
After a new unsuccessful mission in the country , the IMF noted this week that &apos; significant external financing needs &apos; were &apos; a vulnerability &apos; , while being &apos; signs of economic improvement &apos; .
However , for the economist Oleksandr Joloud , the Centre for Political Studies , &apos; you cannot wait for short-term improvement &apos; .
&apos;There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year &apos; , the presidential elections being planned in 2015 , the expert , questioned to the AFP .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
In addition , it is the &apos; uncertainty &apos; that is linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU that Brussels is dependent on the release of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko .
&apos;Signing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term , but there could be negative negative consequences in the short and medium term linked to Russia &apos;s response &apos; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &apos; trade restrictions &apos; from Moscow .
Russia , which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports , has warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev , it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods .
US Green Paper on the Puliccis-Omnicom merger
Puliciis and Omnicom said on Friday that there was no objection from the US authorities to their merger , moving closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency .
The merger brings the second global agency , Omnicom , and the third , Puliciis .
&apos;Omnicom Group and Pulicias have announced today the expiry of the deadline for examining the previously announced merger of Pulicias Group and Omnicom , provided for by the Hart Scott-Rodino Anticut Act of 1976 , as amended &apos; .
They state that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the SSR review period in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions for the realisation of the operation .
&apos;Fusion is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and approval of the shareholders of both groups &apos; .
Congolese army is continuing the M23 rebels
The Congolese army ( FARC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt out the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu in Rwanda and Uganda .
M23 appears to be on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of the towns from the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) that it has controlled from the beginning 20 months ago from the insurgency .
&apos;We shall continue with M23 and make it all the way it is , because it is criminals &apos; , declared to Reuters the Colonel Olivier Hamuli , spokesman for the FARC .
We must not allow them to be reorganised because they have been martyrating the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace .
M23 officials have explained that they have evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrd Bissimwa , who is responsible for the rebellion , said on the FFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks .
The latter , according to the Ugandan mediators , took on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and M23 .
Choggling is reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana , the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week , as well as around Runyoni , a hill in which the M23 rebellion came into being in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insurgents occupied Goma , the mastery of the North Kivu province , taking advantage of the flight from the government garden and the passivity of the Monusco blue cats .
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC , the largest in the world in terms of staffing , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid brigade of intervention made up of South African , Malawi and tanks .
For its part , the staff of the FARC have been reformed and the army has gone to the offensive against M23 , which is changing the course of war .
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;M23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predicting an expert on Congolese affairs , Json Stearns , on his blog Congo Siasa .
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa managed to fight a major insurgency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC .
United Nations experts are accused of Rwanda , which denies it fiercely , to support the M23 militarily , formed from the former Congolese soldiers mutilated .
The head of British diplomacy , William Hague , invited the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint , announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office .
Last week , Kigali spoke of the possibility of military reprisals following the shells in Rwandan territory .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the executing to welcome the entry of the FARC soldiers .
&apos;We have lived a year with M23 , and it seemed unimaginable to us to be released by the army &apos; , testifies to an inhabitant of the neighbouring region of Uganda .
&apos;We have lived in terror ( M23 ) , we are traumatised &apos; , added that man .
The tests carried out by the Paster Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by coronavirus have proved negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &apos; the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two confirmed cases in France to date &apos; .
Tuesday , this 44-year patient had been suspected of being reached , after returning from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed 50 deaths .
The second American oil company , Chevron , reported on Friday of a reduction in its quarterly benefit because of the fall in its refining margins , while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining out of proportion with the group &apos;s objectives .
Its net benefit from the third quarter fell to USD 4.95 billion , or $ 2.57 per action , compared with USD 5.25 billion , or USD 2.69 per action , a year ago .
The analysts questioned by Reuters were on average on a profit from USD 2.71 .
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of petroleum equivalent per day in the course of the quarter , increasing compared with the 2.52 million bpj produced a year ago .
The company is about 2.65 million in this year , with a 25 % growth in production expected by 2017 .
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia .
Due to the cost of these projects , annual investment spending increased by USD 7 billion in two years and is expected to reach USD 36.7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities have fallen slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of downstream activities ( including refining and chemical production ) have fallen from 45 % to USD 380 million .
This reduction in refining margins affects the whole sector .
For example , the main competitor of Chevron , Exxon Mobil , reported on Thursday a net net benefit , despite the increase in its gas and oil production .
Transfer transport : the complaint deemed admissible
The school committee of the Sherbrooke ( SCARS ) has been demanding from the start of the school year the costs of USD 150 per pupil ( up to $ 300 per family ) for pupils benefiting from two homes , a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so .
Before the changes in the last budget , no financial contribution was requested .
&apos;There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested &apos; , Mrs Lefat explains this .
In its opinion , the SCARS has been invited to mediation and has asked for further time to reflect on this .
&apos;It is always better to talk about it , concert and find solutions &apos; , Mrs Lefat says .
The school committee of the Sherbrooke region ( CSRS ) did not want to comment .
The organisation only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint .
Impact on the closure of Homel-God emergencies
In view of the fact that some of the staff and several trade unions , including the CGT , the Minister for Health , Marisol Touran , have been working on the subject for several months , 10 July had decided to &apos; delay the timetable for implementation of the project , and in particular the date for the closure of emergencies which will not be able to take place on 4 November &apos; .
An official request made &apos; so that we do not run any risk at the beginning of the winter of the winter of the winter &apos; but also intended not to hinder the SPS campaign in a few months &apos; time .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should still be effective on that date .
Even if , in the APP , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As of 4 November , the fire brigades , which claimed about a quarter of the 40 000 annual passages in the Hemelel-God emergencies , will have all received a sign of taking the thirty serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of intervals .
In the Hemelel-God , the internal urgencies will leave five internal medicine on Monday .
As for the transfer of the leds of internal medicine , it is scheduled for this month .
&apos;The Homel-God Planning Service must close in the shortest possible time , and for us , it is 4 November &apos; , and it is no longer a case of Lo City , the chairman of the APP &apos;s Committee on Development , which supports the project .
&apos;On 4 November , there will be no more patient patients , only people coming from their own means &apos; confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon , the medical leader of the new Hotel-God .
&apos;But we will continue to welcome emergency patients &apos; , he has said that there is a permanent presence of SMUR vehicles there to transfer serious cases .
Senior senior doctors will remain on the ground , but he is also doing so .
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency service .
&apos;Things are gradually being done &apos; , responding to Nicolas PÃ©ju , the spokesman for the ARS for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in service . &apos;
&apos;The minister lied to us or he was lied &apos; , deploying the Chief Prosecutor , GÃ©rld Kierzk .
As a leader of the SMUR leader at the beginning of July , for leading the front against the reorganization project , it is defined as an &apos; alert &apos; to a &apos; cynical &apos; decision taken by &apos; the medioadministrative technostructure &apos; .
&apos;They are in the process of depressing and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago &apos; .
For him , &apos; if other Paris emergencies could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &apos; .
However , they are regularly engulfed .
For example , there are sometimes nine hours waiting for the emergencies of Lariboiser .
In the ARS , it is claimed that thirty &apos; dispatched &apos; patients on several sites are not at risk of representing an &apos; avalanche &apos; in other emergency services , whose human resources will also have been strengthened .
In the case of the ARS and the APP , the &apos; new hospital model &apos; has already been set up since 7 October and should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients a year .
By the end of the year , liberal practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of &apos; ambulatory care &apos; .
&apos;Where is it if people are asked to self-diagnose &apos; , the question of GÃ©rild Kierzk , who &apos; the concept of a serious emergency &apos; is &apos; dangerous &apos; , is a &apos; medical regression &apos; ?
This is going to happen as in the case of maternity hospitals 3 .
People are not mad , they go where there is the best offer of care .
If the Minister does not take action by Monday , we will be changing the poet , preaching Christopher Prudman , a Chief doctor and a member of the Health CGT .
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list .
In the Nathia Kosciusko-Morizi team , Vincent Roger , the UMP advisor of Paris and elected from the 4th arrow , clearly announces that &apos; even if the Paris MP was for the maintenance of urgencies in the Hemelhe-God , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you are responsible &apos; .
Anne Hidalgo , the PS candidate , once again reminded us on Monday morning of France that she voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark its net disagreement , highlighting Bruno Julliard , his spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy in substance , we cannot accept it without an acceptable system of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama puts an end to the IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to put an end to the listened to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities .
This decision is part of the White House &apos;s attempt to take up its hand in the case of the NSA listening to the revelations made by former Edward Snowden , a refugee in Russia .
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal .
Out of the matter , a head of the US administration replied : &apos; The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance for the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &apos; .
When speaking under the heading of anonymity , this official did not specify whether such supervision had been put in place in the past .
Another official has said that Barack Obama has put a stop to these practices in the past weeks .
This instruction was given at some point at the same time as the end of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , the Senator Committee on Intelligence approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but allowed them to continue .
The committee has introduced further restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and impose a five-year limit on the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new objectives for combating poverty
The United Nations will now start working on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , which had been set up 12 years ago to combat world poverty .
Australian diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the &apos; sustainable development objectives &apos; intended to replace the MDGs , which will expire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development , which began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro .
They were in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by the world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , during the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to &apos; exceed national interests &apos; .
&apos;I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development targets ( ODD ) &apos; , he added .
These DDCs will be based on progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to realise our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the MDGs .
The concern about security in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts are emerging between powerful figures .
At the height of the statue of Saama Machl , the founder of Mozambique , the founding President of Mozambique , thousands of people gathered in the Maputo centre to outraged peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration .
&apos;We want peace to come back ; we want stability &apos; , said Vanessa de Soua , Director-General of an investment society .
Inquet for the future of his country , she has exchanged her working clothes against a tee-shirt with the reference &apos; we want safety &apos; in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd on the place of the capital of the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renault , the worst clichÃ©s since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago .
The Reno was once a famous rebel movement , supported initially by Rhodesia , and then the South African apartheid Government in the efforts to destabilise the country &apos;s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
The analysts believe that the country should not slip into an open conflict , but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population .
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy , since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than 50 MFs of investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Italy , Italy and Anadarko from the United States .
The Frelimo , the governing party and the main political force since 1975 , and the Reno are mutually exclusive .
The Reno states that the government is at the root of the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional bastion of the Reno , on 17 October .
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the foundations of the Reno and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , and Fernando Mazanga , the spokesman for the Reno , according to the Financial Times .
The government is making the Reno responsible for triggering conflicts and accused of attacking soldiers .
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability .
Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP , the French press agency , that Mr Dhlakama considered himself a &apos; loser &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he had left him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government &apos; .
The Fintermo and the Renault insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern was growing after Mr Mazanga said that the Reno was abandoning the 1992 Peace Agreement .
He said to the FTT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Flink .
&apos;We want to resume the negotiations , but with the greatest seriousness &apos; , Mr Mazanga said .
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions that have been fuelled by a series of conflicts this year .
&apos;These are two great men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who do not stop fighting &apos; , explained Joseph Hanlon , a confendant of the open and specialist university in Mozambique .
None of them can negotiate well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
The Reno , which is in favour of electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year .
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt by a patient movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war on the part of the government .
The proportion of the votes collected by the Renault has been steadily declining since 1992 , while a new party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( MDM ) , which was created by a former member of the Reno , should obtain more votes in the elections .
Mr Mazzanga said that Mr Guebuza - who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&apos;He does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the Presidency &apos; , he said Mr Mazanga .
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Reno is , but it has led to disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway .
Most of the clouds have taken place in the province of Sofala , which is located several hundred kilometres away from the north of Maputo , but where there is Beira , the port where mining companies , especially Rio Tinto and Vale , export coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Reno threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Mazanga was falsely timid when he asked whether the Reno would respond to this threat .
The Reno wanted to &apos; warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique &apos; , mentioned Mr Mazanga .
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government , declares Fernando Lima , the Director of Medicare , an independent media society , many people being concerned about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings .
&apos;People believe that those responsible for the country &apos;s future are the government and the President , and that it is up to the President to find solutions to the problems &apos; , he explained .
Omar Sultuane , a demonstration , said that people only wanted stability .
&apos;No one cares about the Reno or Felio , they just want to find peace , they want to have free access to the roads &apos; .
The myths and legs of children should be taught as &apos; lifestyle models &apos; , declares the author .
The Holy Hood could show that &apos; the brutal force does not carry weight against subtle ruins &apos; , while the legend arons reveal the importance of having a dream .
In saying that many myths would be &apos; far too violent , far too scandalous and in some cases far too obscure to be taught at school &apos; , Cusley-Holland called for a &apos; careful selection &apos; of the works adapted to age .
&apos;I find it wonderful that in America , myths and folklore are already part of education &apos; .
I have been arguing for this project for 20 years .
He has added that the fact that authors and teachers are &apos; openly didactic &apos; means that children &apos; get off completely &apos; , the messages being &apos; sublied &apos; in pleasant stories .
Susley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Nord Myths and British Folk Tale , said : &apos; You may have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight &apos; .
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer write for adults and an adult author who is written for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything should be simplified or done well , but there is an unborn sense of good and evil .
It must be sublied ; it must be revealed through a history rather than declared .
The basis of what is known and what is not said .
A combatant of the armed arm of Hamas was killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli cat shooting in the Gaza Strip , was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists led to a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a shells of Israeli blunders .
Emerging of the NSA : the United States is &apos; going too far &apos; , admitting Kerry Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone &apos; too far &apos; in the area of espionage , acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry , in the first round of Washington in full dispute with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
After ten days of scandal , revelations and denials between the United States and their European allies , this is the first time that a US government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;In some cases , I concede you , as the President has done , some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to ensure that this is no longer in the future &apos; , said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he was involved since Washington on Thursday 31 October in video .
In his repeated speech , in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague , the US diplomatic leader has long justified the intelligence and gathering of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks .
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those from London in July 2005 , John Kerry assured that the US authorities had had a large number of terrorist projects , thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information .
&apos;We have de facto prevented aircraft from falling , that buildings do not explode and that people are being murdered , because we were able to be informed upstream of these projects &apos; , argued the patron of American diplomacy .
And , as John Kerry said to Europeans , &apos; I assure you that in this process of innocent people were not mistaken &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;And yes , in some cases , it has gone too far &apos; , has still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal at a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured us on Thursday evening that President Obama was &apos; resolved to try to clarify and carry out a review of these practices so that no one feels wrong &apos; .
However , the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new revelations in the press .
According to the Washington Post , the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users .
The newspaper , which quotes documents obtained from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden , states that the programme called &apos; MUSCUR &apos; , and conducted with the British NSA counterpart , GCC , allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by Internet giants .
According to one of the documents , some 181 million elements had been collected in the last month of January - from metal to e-mails , text parts or audio or video documents .
These interceptions would take place outside the United States .
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , a number of major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain or Italy have shown that the NSA would have intercepted data and communications from allies from the United States and their leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
In the face of the anger of European states , and even though leaks in the US press claimed that the US President was not aware of such an listen , Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject , invoking national security .
On the other hand , the Pope of the powerful NSA , General Keith Alexander , has denied him that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He has even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications , before providing them with the NSA .
This would relate to &apos; military operations &apos; in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States , and that would definitely not aim for Europe .
And the polemics went to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia has called the ambassador of Australia , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international espionage , which has also led to China being called to account .
The Saint-Gerhandi Paris will receive Lorient Friday without its master &apos;s master , the Swede Zlaan Ibrahimovic , who is injured , announces the League 1 club in a communiquÃ© .
The PSG , the leader of the championship in Monaco with the difference of purpose , has broadcast the list of players who have been detained for this 12th Day match , without the attachment of 32 years .
The communiquÃ© simply says that he is &apos; injured &apos; , without specifying the nature of injury .
However , it was suffering from an inflamation of the left left when it returned to selection , at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony in memory of the deputies
The crematorium of Father Lacher organises , at 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the well-founded demarches in its establishment during the year .
Anne Hidalgo , a socialist candidate in the Paris maker , must attend , and will then explain at a press conference his proposals for funeral .
To follow the ceremony , click above .
For their own obstinacy , more and more French people choose the creation , rather than inhumation : 53 % , according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people , instead of 47 % .
For the sake of the nearest , it is the other way round : the French prefer to be humorous ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
If they have the misfortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book Le Mort in ash , Damy Le Guay , philosopher and Vice-President of the National Committee on Ethnic Ethics , insists on the &apos; violence &apos; represented by the creation , for the survivors .
There is , with the creation , &apos; violence in the loved body &apos; , which is going to be &apos; reduced to a lot of ash &apos; in a very short space of time , and not after a process of decay , which &apos; would accompany the phases of the mourning &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which is aimed at &apos; wiping out the uniqueness and distinguishing signs &apos; reduced to &apos; anonymity &apos; of the ash .
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries , and is it still a bad thing in France ?
&apos;Because the creation is a new fact &apos; , Marie-FrÃ©rique BacquÃ© , chairwoman of the Society of thanatology and author of the book , is a new one .
It is only tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to apportion it .
To call for creativity is for FranÃ§ois Michad-NÃ©rard , Director General of the funeral service of the City of Paris , to provide for the defunct a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with inhumation .
The annual survey of Ifsos shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony .
77 % of French people want one , for their relatives , whether religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of people who have chosen a creation want a ceremony .
There are 66 % of the athletes or non-believers .
The crematoria has adapted to this development of society .
&apos;For ten years now , they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the ashes of the ash &apos; .
70 % of the institutions now propose ceremonial masters , who carry out the next ritual , in the presence of the body : to welcome the Assembly , to name the defunct , to link it to the others , to talk about it , to give meaning to its death , to organise the goodbye .
This is the case with the crematorium of the Father Lacher , since 1998 .
The masters of ceremony are often people who have converted .
There are also former Catholic priests .
It is in this context that the crematorium of the Father Lacher organises , since 2010 , the day of the Toussault , several ceremonial , secular and non-religious ceremonies , to which he invites the families of the people who have been created in the year .
For the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies is passed on to the attention of those who could not travel .
The crematorium has allowed us to pass it on .
In the Seyne , the relocation of rabies
At the beginning of the week , a family left its apartment in the middle of the Frutidor D2 building , due to the presence of rats .
In the face of the urgency of the situation , the Director of the Southern Habitat Office , the Director of the South Habitat , has proposed , in an exceptional and temporary manner , to relocate the couple and three children in a T4 nine .
However , the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons &apos; and the situation is blocked .
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions , estimates Joel Canapa , the Director of the Office .
There have always been rats in the cities .
The corporation company makes two passages a year and , in addition , we are doing our utmost to meet every request by the people .
We have done 64 speeches since the end of last winter .
The area is not left out , and the rats are not pulling into the city .
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health , the products of decreation are four times less efficient than in the past , but for two rats we will not kill a goose .
&apos;We have not invited the rats at home &apos; , defending the father of the family who has left home to settle in hotel .
We are soon without a penny and we expect a new housing , at the same tariff as the old one .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday , despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics .
The Cote has suffered from the fall in the dollar against the yen , which is detrimental to exporting values and the warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday .
The Nikkei index lost 12.37 points ( 0.88 % ) to 14 201.57 and the Topix gave in 11.23 points ( 0.94 % ) to 1 183.03 .
Sony has fallen by more than 11 % to 1 668 yen .
A house is prey to flames in the Quebec
A fire that took place at midday on Friday - Quebec was quickly controlled .
More than 30 fire brigades were sent to 9 on the Hebrert street .
The flames have found themselves in a home of three homes divided over four parts behind the Court of Quebec .
Not all tenants were in the fire .
The fire was mastered one hour after the arrival of the fire brigades , many of whom were involved .
As soon as our first fire brigades arrived , they really saw smoke .
&apos;Then the alarms were followed up , because it took the step to attack the building , because it was buildings that were collated here &apos; , explained France LÃ©visher , spokesman for the Quebec fire brigade .
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire .
Ben Greenman : 10th anniversary of New York
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the de facto Frank Fay player , who took the role of a master of ceremony in Palace Theater , on Broadway , began to talk directly to the public , on the tone of the conversation .
The innovation of Fay has continued over the years , until the New York Festival has recently been re-launched .
Creed and supervised by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the C-Up Caroline club , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and major theatres .
&apos;Most of the posters have emerged in the Caroline , and have been a great success , until they have become too famous to play in a club &apos; , said Hirsch .
We have created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them .
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of &apos; Stand Up for Heres &apos; , a comic and music evening for the former combatants , organized in the Madison Spreingsteen , the Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Choby .
The festival has grown up , just like the world of the comedie .
Many of the comedians involved in this year &apos;s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits , for example , by setting out spectacles on small television channels , such as COMs Central , FX and Spike .
Nick Kroll appeared on the scene in a sicom on a cable chain ( &apos; The Hague &apos; ) on the subject of the GXX project , which is jealously laciously lacious , and now has its own spectacle of skettches on the Central Comal .
Jenny Slate took part in the programme &apos; Studdy Night Long &apos; and was part of the &apos; Parks and Recreation &apos; series , but it is well known for its series of videos &apos; Marcel the Shell with Shoes &apos; .
Kroll and Slate , as well as other young comedians to the singular voice ( the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik , the irony of racial justice in the form of racial justice ) , are products produced by the decentralized world of the American comic .
One of the main attractiveness of the festival this year will be an interview : David Steinberg discussing Larry David .
Steinberg has started as a standardized comic , but it has become a film and television filmmaker , as well as an informal historian of the comic .
Between 2005 and 2007 , it led to a broadcast on TV Land , which was called &apos; Sit Down Comedy &apos; .
The meeting is taking place at the Hille Hotel in the centre of Manhattan .
&apos;The city is definitively in the comic DNA of all the work of Larry &apos; , said Steinberg .
He told me that , when he was here , sometimes he was a rude between two buildings and said , if I lose all my money , perhaps I will live here .
Oil prices continue to fall and move closer to $ 96 per barrel .
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday when concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report showing that the energy-intensive Chinese manufacturing sector is becoming stronger .
The price of the US benchmark for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) .
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday , leaving it with a 5.8 % drop in October .
The abundant supply of crude oil has been weighing on prices in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy indicated on Wednesday that US supplies rose by 4.1 million barrels last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels .
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to grow again after growth rose to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after a fall that has not been known for two decades in the last quarter .
Gross Brent , a reference to the international crude already used by US refineries , lost 26 cents to fall to USD 108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Parliamentary Exchange ( ECE ) in London .
Removing the right to abortion in Texas
A federal court court has restored certain restrictions to Texas to the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy , which had been blocked by a judge judge this week .
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The judgment made by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will be practising PVG will have to have a &apos; privilege &apos; to local hospitals .
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , in accordance with his status as a hospital member , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment .
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state clinics because these clinics have not managed to obtain this &apos; admission privilege &apos; for their practitioners .
In total , it would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions .
On Monday , a judge judge estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional .
But the Attorney General of Texas , the Republican , Greg Abbott , who is holding the post of governor , asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first-instance judgment that blocked the application of the law .
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January .
The New Star succeeded in a return in force , with the hearing , with 1.3 million viewers behind their post post , or 5.6 % of audience .
But was it the case ?
Some 10 000 candidates came to the hearings of this 10th season , to deal with the jury : Marane , the Sinct , the Perche AndrÃ© Manoukian and Olivier Bas .
On Twitter , viewers shared their comments .
The excitement to find their favourite programme , many were disappointed .
But why are so many disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As each year , the first hearing of hearing is a wide choice of grass , for the best and sometimes for the worst .
However , on Twitter , you want to show a show , emotion , originality , music ...
Fortunately , some of them found their accounts .
Many of them have tried the New Star and sometimes even went to the end .
Behind the television screens , the voys of success are still there , season after season .
Others have just the ambition to laugh .
The Court is blocking a decision on the NYPD control and control policy
A Federal Court of Appeal blocked on Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and control programme of the New York police department and made it clear .
The United States &apos; Court of Appeal ( second circuit ) has indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheein was suspended until after the city &apos;s appeal .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution as a result of the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens .
The city has made use of its conclusions and corrective prescriptions , including a decision to give a supervisor to help the police department change its policy and the training programme associated with it .
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the request for suspension .
The Court of Appeal said that the judge should be drawn from the dossier because it infringed the code of conduct of judges by endangering the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , partly because of a series of meetings given to the media and public statements in which she responded publicly to the Court &apos;s criticism .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and of panic in their control and search programme .
It has appointed an external supervisor to oversee the changes , including the reform of policies , training and supervision , and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the call by the city should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The tactics of control and searches have been criticised by many defenders of civil rights .
This system of control and searches has been in existence for decades , but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg , to reach its highest historical level in 2011 , with 684 330 controls that mainly related to black men and panic .
Judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Those who advocate changes in the NYPD control and control programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices , make it possible to have more effective police forces and trust , and will be able to change the way in which police departments use politics .
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime , representing a waste of money and not solving the wider problem of the police forces under pressure after police officers have been considerably reduced over the last decade .
The judge has pointed out that it does not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but to reform the way in which the NYPD implements its controls .
The tenants must vote , because each of them pays on average USD 100 per month on the price of housing that goes to the Villes .
When the owner pays $ 5,000 in municipal taxes , he divides the amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes .
We are sending a clear message .
We need to change things in the City .
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks to USD 100 000 , land from ECU 45-5 million to the case where ...
To vote is the best way to speak and say that it is enough .
Fine of the ElysÃ©e
In the 500 m2 m2 of elysean kitchen , which was committed after working in embassies , the cook took every ladder to the head , nine years ago .
He served six French presidents , Georges Pompidou to FranÃ§ois Hollande , by way of Nicolas Sarkozy , including on their holiday places , and fed an incalculable number of the world &apos;s large numbers in a quasi-anonymity that he only now breaks at the time of retirement .
The man with an open face , unguarded and glasses of intellectual , born on 24 October 1953 to the Ferte-Saint Aubin , is a pawn of a pathetic CAP .
His mother was a cook in a Soil castle .
&apos;I have gone from one castle to another ! &apos; , ironise Bernard Vaute , who knows not only the six presidents for whom he has been unofficial , but also their wives and some of their guests .
&apos;It is always the Head of the State or his companion or wife who chooses the menus &apos; .
&apos;Mrs Chirac was a little more involved , she came directly to kitchen &apos; , to the point she had banned women in the ElysÃ©e kitchen !
Whoever disagrees with the heads of state who had a relative indifference to land feeds , &apos; they are all gurbish &apos; , denouncing Bernard Vaute .
Jacques Chirac certainly had &apos; a slightly more developed appetite &apos; .
But with Nicolas Sarkozy , who had removed cheese , the bases were empty !
As for FranÃ§ois Hollande , who restored cheese , &apos; it is someone who likes to eat &apos; and &apos; there is little that he does not like &apos; .
The current Head of State , who has regained the lost kilos before the presidential campaign , has no application of a specific regime .
Bernard Vaute also remembers the pressure that has been placed on his shoulders , particularly at the State dinners of the ElysÃ©e : we have to use &apos; between 200 and 250 people in approximately one hour &apos; .
The night is almost white .
These people would not understand that there are mistakes .
The former head of the ElysÃ©e kitchen , who took a glass on Tuesday evening with his team , family and friends , is part of the heart of &apos; FranÃ§ois Hollande &apos; .
He said praise .
&apos;His human side has emerged &apos; , he says .
The leader will be replaced by his deputy , Wilhelm Gomez , 35 years , who has for his part been in the ElysÃ©e for 17 years .
Fair in a house built in 1850
An historic house built in 1850 was the prey to the flames in the Libebec Friday Friday .
The building of four housing , in the 15 of the Hebrert street , was the subject of three alarms in the fire service .
The fire was said before , but it was on the three parts of the buildings .
France , the spokesman for the Quebec fire protection service , made it clear that rapid action by the fire brigades prevented the spread of fire to adjacent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where buildings are built in a close way .
The house burned home was home to four homes , but no tenants were in the place at the time of the fire .
The damage was very limited , even though water caused damage .
An investigation will be carried out into the origin , but the criminals have removed the theory of a criminal act .
Wall Street :
Martin Scorese leaves a few images of his next film , which is an ambitious New York broker , to be embodied by Leonardo Diaprio .
Forget it to be reasonable and leave your tickets .
Leonardo Diaprio is going to deceive you in its role as a trader .
Martin Scorese has given us the real story of a &apos; Long Island stock exchange &apos; , which refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street .
In the 1980s , Jordan Belstrong then went a long way to make him a rich , very rich man .
The opportunity to follow up on its unbelievable rise , but also the dramatic fall that will follow .
Without limits , the man is encroaching on festivals , women and drugs .
Doubtless and excesses of all kinds are the masters of this madness .
The Scorese-DiCaprio couple seems to have regained the magic that had united them in Shutter Island .
The way out of the new Scorese was delayed because of its too long .
It would appear that the film is finally at 245 .
In the Chamber on 25 December , he will be able to take a fair part in the race to sons .
Couose used telephone piracy to check a tug in the face of a killer .
The former editor of News of the World , Andry Coulson , would have used &apos; telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation &apos; to try to confirm a two-way killing on a link with the Minister of the Interior , Charles Clarke .
The Prosecutor Andrew Esays QC said in the court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Powlby , his &apos; special special adviser &apos; .
It was pointed out at the court that the newspaper Glenn Mulcaire , a private device , pirates Powlby &apos;s box , and &apos; planting in front of his own door &apos; , but Coulson also called it and gave him the green messages .
The accusation suggests that Mr Coulson , who is now the editor of NotW , is not the kind of man to stay in the house of people in the hope of surprises , that is the kind of man to love the history of the people to see what they say .
He said that NotW used three means to investigate matters : telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation .
The editor is personally involved in the third .
It is obvious that it is the second , supervision , it cannot be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is it aware of the telephone piracy ?
He says otherwise , but we say &apos; of course &apos; .
The rumours about a link involving Clarke were first taken up by the office in NotW when a source , having a sexual attractiveness to Miss Powlby , said that he was told : &apos; Do not lose time with her , she is with Charles . &apos;
A gang , on which there were pirated messages on his phone at least three times , was seized at the home of the Picar in August 2006 .
The investigators have also found seizure on the computer of the private device that concerned Miss Powlby and his sister sister in a &apos; Projet &apos; dossier .
During the period when the device investigated it , Miss Powlby &apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls for information on her , added Mr Eis .
In the meantime , the former Neville Thurlbeck and the former defer James Weaerup have overseen the monitoring of the minor facts and gestures of Miss Powlby .
In a vote that he left on 18 June 2005 , Coulson said : &apos; I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow , of which I would really like to speak in Charles . &apos;
Mr Edis has explained that the involvement of Couson in history has followed the same pattern with other important men , such as the former Minister of Interior David Bunkett .
The jury was heard on Thursday that Couson had to deal with Mr Bunkett about a connection with a married woman when he himself was a co-defender Rebekah Brooks , who was also married at that time .
Couk and Brooks deny that they have conspired with others to pirate telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Murlbeck , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted that they have made telephone piracy .
Barack Obama is receiving the Prime Minister of Iraq , in the middle of violence
The US President was supposed to receive the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki on Friday , 1 November 2013 , seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published on Friday , 1 November by the Iraqi authorities .
964 people died in the violence in October , including 855 civilians , 65 policemen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 deaths and 1 902 injured .
These violence is increasingly murderous despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki , dominated by the Shiites .
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008 , when 1 073 people had been killed .
Two years after the withdrawal of US troops , the level of violence leads to a new conflagration when neighbouring Syria is in the grip of a civil war .
Cars are hit by markets , mosques , marriages and funeral .
Men are slaughtered on the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complains to be politically marginalised and to be the target of unjust arrests , has encouraged this outbreak of violence .
On Friday , new violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars trapped in the north of Baghdad .
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ( EIIL ) , a group affiliated with al-Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , also involved in the civil war in Syria .
Nouri al-Maliki wants a &apos; global war &apos; against al-Qaeda .
Violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting , on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the US President , elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country , had painted an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington , Nouri al-Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive , and the elected representatives of Congress .
On Thursday he called for the international community to conduct a &apos; third world war &apos; against al-Qaeda .
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican senators and democrats .
But the latter also criticized Nouri al-Maliki , a Shiite , for a partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &apos; sectarian and authoritarian policy &apos; .
They have also asked Barack Obama to make it clear to Nouri al-Maliki that &apos; Iran &apos;s pernicious influence in the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship &apos; .
Beijing accuses a Uighur Group of the Tiananmen attack
China &apos;s internal security leader accused a group of Xinjiang separatists on Friday of being behind the bomb attack on the car , which claimed five deaths in Tiananmen Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday .
The vehicle , a SUV , has sunk on the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital , a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989 , and shooting its three passengers and two smugglers .
Meng Jianzhu , a member of the political Bureau responsible for internal security issues , accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan to be the instigator of this attack .
Many Uighurs , a Turkish-based minority in Xinjiang , call this Chinese province East Turkestan .
For the Chinese Government , this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there by means of independence claims .
&apos;The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organised and premeditated &apos; , said Mg to the Hong Kong Phoenix TV channel .
&apos;The group that was held behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan &apos; , he added , as he said , by the new China agency .
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is Uyghur and made it clear that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained noises full of petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious envoys .
The incident made 42 injured .
Eastern Turkestan is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations .
The Vatican on contraception , divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey throughout the world on how the parks handle sensitive issues such as contraception , divorce and couples of the same sex .
The poll asks the participants how priests look after gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage .
The poll was sent in the middle of October to each national conference of bishops , with a sign of obtaining as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important gathering on the family that Pope FranÃ§ois is planning next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the &apos; National Catholic Reporting &apos; , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic bishops in the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that every bishop would decide how to scrap the parks .
In the UK , bishops have published the Internet survey , asking Catholics to participate .
DRC
The ironclad of M23 , a few hundred combatants , was left to almost 2000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Channel , Runyonyi and Mbuzi , close to Bunagana and Joma , two places around 80 km north of Goma , the capital of the North Kivu province .
&apos;It has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continues in spite of night &apos; , indicated to the AFP a inhabitant of Joma , joined by telephone at 12.30 p.m. , and according to whom a girl was injured in the morning .
&apos;The intensity of clashes has fallen somewhat &apos; , he added , &apos; it seems that the FARC Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little . &apos;
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous , the soldiers had &apos; spent the night &apos; in Jomba before standing on the front for a &apos; raging operation &apos; .
There was a very clear understanding of the fact that there was a lot of light .
From Bunagana , political fiefdoms and the last strong place of the rebellion on Wednesday , a journalist from the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations .
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DRC , the fighting went &apos; in a final phase &apos; , with the FARC having &apos; endured the positions of the 23 resides to depart &apos; .
Since the resumption , on Friday , of clashes between the Movement of 23 Mars ( M23 ) and the army , the Monusco is not directly involved in the fighting , but it provides the government with significant support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several tens of soldiers , who were well supplied with munitions , were moving towards the front line .
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers .
A little earlier , on the road to Bunagana , post-border with Uganda , the military aided by civilians was carrying a multifaceted rocket rocket on a FRDC infant truck , which is to be seen by another enslavement piling the positions of M23 on hills .
The Congolese President , Joseph Kabila , called on the rebels on Wednesday evening to &apos; demobilise &apos; or to be disarmed by force , but left the Kampala process open , where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing it since December .
On the ground , the political leaders of the M23 are hoping to reach an agreement .
&apos;We have finished the talks , it is only the Ugandan mediation to organise the signing &apos; , said Roger Lumbaa , Vice-President of the M23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
The M23 was born of a mutiny , in April 2012 , of former rebels , mostly tutsi , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23 , which Kigali and Kampala refute .
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC , and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources .
In Bunagana , on the Ugandan side of the border , where there were around 5000 people between Monday and Wednesday , according to the UN , the movement of return to the DRC , which took place in the morning , reversed in the middle of the day .
&apos;This morning we went through to our fields , but the military told us to go back &apos; , indicated to the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi , surrounded by its nine children , including one on the back .
There is the impression that the fire is coming closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of residents crossed the border , some with a headline match , to spend the night in Uganda .
The musical compound
Classified , sophisticated , popular , in English or French , soft and danced productions take their flight .
After Broadway and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It is a revolution : musical to French is a success story .
Longs from Paris from Paris to Mozart to Mozart , most of the attempts are being made in a ridiculous way .
And the successes such as Cabaret or the Mistry were the height of the mystery .
The arrival of Jean-Luc Chopin in Chastella and Settlement - Enterprise in Mogador has changed the situation .
Today , these two scenes are handling headlines as successful tubes .
The first is , this Christmas , its excellent Mair Fair in Lady and announces that the global creation of &apos; an American in Paris &apos; should be established .
In Mogador , &apos; Bshe and Bast &apos; may well be one of the successes of the season .
On the other scenes , musical spectacles such as &apos; 1789 &apos; , &apos; the amateurs of the Bastille &apos; and the small musical comedians such as &apos; Disco &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are being put at the mercy of success and quality .
Patrick Niedo , the author of the &apos; History of musical comedie &apos; reference book and confers the Chaster &apos;s Theaster , analyses the reasons for such a hard-won success .
How do the French musical compounds evolve ?
The offer has increased .
First of all , there is the &apos; music spectacles &apos; that evolve as producers ...
Some of them are using fine images of images and a real history as in 1789 , the Amants of the Bastille .
Others take a leap of 15 years back on the pretext that you can be used to a little or nothing when you have Matt - Pokora at the head of the poster .
After that , we have musical compounds with the sompous production of Chasteli , which brings us back to the golden age of Broadway and to discover the universe of Stephen Sonhehem , the largest living composer .
Settlement - Enterprise popularise of the Anglo-Saxon musical comeditions by adapting them in French .
Independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough .
However , projects under way as &apos; Rose &apos; , &apos; The Bailer of Women &apos; or &apos; Sawle of the spring &apos; , have difficulty in being financed .
Do we have enough artists who are able , like Broadway , to play and dance ?
In Paris , when there are eight music spectacles in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 talents who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , the cradle of music is very different .
Young people are trained in many schools .
There is a lot of jobs between the regional theatres , the turf , Broadway , the off-Broadway ...
The tale of talent is as high as the number of posts to be filled .
Why are the tournaments in the province so successful ?
With the exception of the opera , the province remains the poor parent of culture in France .
Few parts of theatre go around , and it is often the case of a buffer for adults and not young adults .
The musical spectacles fill this gap .
It is these same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemeral stars ...
Proposing beautiful , often talented young men at the top of a musical spectacle is an assurance of an inflow of these young girls and often of their entire family .
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are sorely - held by professionals who answer questions .
These spectacles are very expected when they arrive in a Lenin in province .
The Amaynaise is rising in Paris and disguised by provincial provincial provinmen .
The show is designed to enter all the major salts in France in the same form as in Paris .
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver
A road accident made a serious wounded , on Friday morning at 6.30 p.m. , on the home home in Brussels at the height of Hoeilart , in the direction of Waterloo .
The car of a driving force was lost by a ghost driver who is unscathed .
Ring was closed to circulation , up to 900 , in the case of the accident , the time that the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
However , this situation has not caused any traffic jams because the accident took place at the height of the Hosilaart exit .
The circulation of traffic has therefore been removed from this exit / entry .
A child injured in an attraction to Disneyland Paris
A five-year child was seriously injured following an accident on an attractiveness to Disneyland Paris .
Its vital prognosis is no longer committed , but it is still hospitalised .
At the time of the fall , the boy was with his father on a ship of the attractiveness of the Caribbean .
It has been closed down .
DRC :
Children are playing a carbon blunder that belonged to the rebels of M23 , in Kurimba , on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DRC .
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bastion of the rebels of M23 near Bunagana in the east of the DRC .
The aim is to delocate the M23 of the hills that overlap Bunagana .
Yesterday we took the hill in Buginia , which overshadows that of Mbuzi .
Today , Mbuzi should fall by himself .
The hill of Runyonyi will remain .
&apos;Choice is not very strategic &apos; , has indicated the FFP the Governor of North Kivu , Jutie Pucku .
Mr Pucku plans to travel on Saturday .
Politicians and the last strong place of the rebellion , this town is located on the Ugandan border , about 80 km north of Goma .
It was taken on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday .
Ever since , a few hundreds of irreductible from M23 have been left to almost 2 000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Channel , Runyonyi and Mbuzi , near Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Joma
In Jomba , an inhabitant who had reported that there was a close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was &apos; calm since this morning &apos; .
He says that a woman and his child were killed by the fighting on the eve and buried .
A girl was wounded by the ball , and three people were injured , including a complaint , evacuated by the FARC , added this witness cited by the AFP .
Since the resumption of fighting between FARC and rebels on 25 October , the two warring parties have not given any assessment of the loss of human life .
The NSA revelations increase the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance of state surveillance
By a good day at the end of August , a German police helicopter overflying the British Consulate in Frankfurt , the financial capital of Germany .
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( BfV ) , the German National Intelligence Agency , its mission was to photograph the roof of the US forerunner , located at less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .
The German media explain that the BfV hoped to see the presence of listening antens and that the operation triggered an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James Claper , the Director of US intelligence services , once again insisted in September that the United States does not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to &apos; steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies for American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits &apos; .
But since Edward Snowden , the consultant who has become whistleblowers , has begun to uncover his inexhaustible treasure of information about US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders no longer know if the director is to be believed .
Reports , according to which the US National Security Agency spies the Brazilian oil company Petrobras , has had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in Could , in particular Google and Yahoo , have more than ever aroused the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance .
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s telephone had been pirated , perhaps even for a decade , has been the drop of water that has shrunk .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then business leaders are surely also potential targets .
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent .
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used in their mutual interest .
&apos;Germany must wake up &apos; , declare Oliver GrÃ¼n , President of BITMi , representing German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the United States is such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to an investigation published in July by the EY board .
However , in all the documents unveiled by Mr Snowden , there is no indication so far that the United States has passed foreign secrets from foreign companies to American companies .
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Business leaders are sceptical about this .
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only close my eyes and re-open them slowly ...
&apos;That is not the right way to go &apos; , it says Hasso Plattner , the President of the German company company company SAP .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then we should not let it die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , coal to cars and farmers .
Everything except the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistication of US spying agencies exposed by Snowden &apos;s revelations were a shock for some companies that believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of supervision .
A major change is taking place in the cloud computer , as European leaders have become aware that the data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable .
According to an investigation carried out by the Could Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-US members have given up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cloud after the revelations on the US Exploration of Prism data .
Jim Snabe , co-director of SAP , says : &apos; Our customers are now asking us a question that they were not asking us a year ago : where are my data retained and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that court ? &apos;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew , namely that the powerful states want to fly their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage .
There has always been .
It has been a recurring theme for many years , and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion &apos; , declares Kurt Bock , Director General of the BASF chemicals company .
The Americans are spying on business and industrial , just as we are spies , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Entrepreneurs are usually unwilling to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place , if that would leave the advantage of an adversary .
The large companies have long been marching the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB in a professional salt or to leave a lapsed computer without supervision in a hotel room .
Ulrich Hackenberg , a member of the Board of Directors of the Auto Automotive Automotive , says that the collection of mobile phones prior to the Council meetings , so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices , has been common practice for years .
Germany &apos;s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones in their travel abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of the martphons .
The mobile phones paid are then thrown .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and supervision .
Many SMEs in Germany are world leaders in their particular niche .
&apos;SMEs often lack experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorised access &apos; , warned BfV in a report .
The US is warning their own companies about the economic spying activities carried out by other countries .
The US National Intelligence Etimadte ( NIE ) carried out in February by the United States , cited France , as was Russia and Israel , guilty of the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence , behind China , according to the Washington Post .
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage , &apos; the French are the worst &apos; .
Bernard S40 , the former French Internal Intelligence Director , the DCRI , said in an interview this month : &apos; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , are spying their allies . &apos;
The parents of a teenage Georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , believe that their son was murdered .
The parents of an adolescent of Georgia , whose body was found in a rough rug in the gymnate of his school , think that their son was murdered , declared the family lawyer on Thursday .
Kendrick Johnson , from Valdosta in Georgia , was found on 11 January stuck in a carpelt of a carpet behind the grades of the gymnate of his school .
The sheriff investigators of the County de Lowndes concluded that Johnson died in unsolicited circumstances , but the family of the seventeen-year-old boy contests these conclusions .
&apos;They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered &apos; , said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jaclon Johnson , on Fparadox News.com.
They have never thought that he is dead as it is in the sheriff conclusions .
&apos;They think that it defies logic , physical laws and common sense &apos; , added Crup .
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered with the sole aim of covering the people responsible for the death of their son .
&apos;They sent their son to school with a cartable , and they made them in a mortuary bag &apos; , he added .
The US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Johnson , pointing out that a number of important issues remained unanswered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I will follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My aim is to discover the truth .
&apos;I think there is a sufficient basis &apos; to open an official investigation , he said .
Moore said to journalists that the first authoropsy indicated that Johnson was deceived by &apos; positioning &apos; .
However , a second Autopsy has identified another cause of death , according to Moore .
&apos;A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation &apos; .
Moore added that if he updates elements that justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson , he will ask the FBI to conduct it .
The representative of the County Office of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday .
A judge from southern Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video recordings that the investigators had examined .
The parents of the teenage have said that they expect video images to contain indices about the circumstances of his death .
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
On Wednesday , the US Centre for Disease Control has published a series of directives indicating how to manage children &apos;s food allergies in school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publishes , since the number of children in school age with food allergies has soared .
A child in 20 in the United States now suffers from food allergies .
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child rose by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise the awareness of the professionary body and staff for food allergies in the child , and how to treat them in the event of allergic reactions .
It also recommends that schools should have a spachine stock - the self-injecting of the EpiPen mark being the most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially lethal anaplaxia .
The legislative assemblies of the Member States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily found spacepine in stock .
The report also includes a list of the typical symptoms provided by children who have an allergic reaction .
Children can say , &apos; I have the impression that there is something that makes me feel the language &apos; , &apos; I have the impression that I have a hair on the language &apos; or &apos; I have plots on language &apos; .
The NSA case highlights the complete absence of a debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which is hosting in public by convening the United States ambassador on 21 October , and on the other banning the overflying of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane , on the basis of the rumour of the presence on the board of Edward Snowden ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When FranÃ§ois Hollande phone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabilus unequivocal the US ambassador , they react to a true discovery , which is the size of the US surveillance of all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the Monde &apos;s columns in a few weeks &apos; time , on the one hand , the reproduction of US diplomatic correspondence and , on the other , a condemnation of the Hazi Quai of the NSA ?
Would it not be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part ?
The journalistic approach is not moral positioning , but research into the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion .
When WikiLeaks lift the veil on American diplomacy on political or other issues around the world , we consider that , in the light of American power , this is an important light .
When we describe the US interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is not in any way to show us that this is a practice to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the NSA on terrorist operations for our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The fact that the United States , but also France , has been in place for a large ten years , has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Moreover , in this area , France and the United States , in particular , have put in place almost daily cooperation and exchange of information and are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French by means of the NSA .
France can be led , for example , to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services , and in return - as has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world .
Therefore , the underlying question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools , that the issue of the complete lack of prior debate , particularly in the parliaments , on the justification of such systems , the perimeter that must be their own , and ultimately the issue of violations of freedoms .
What is the real risk of the US ?
It is true , I do not see how they can be punished .
The risk of the Americans may be twofold .
The first is when their allies - and this was the case recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes at the highest summit in their state , have been monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have strained .
Another effect may be more economical : more and more European or South American companies are reluctant , in the light of revelations , to hand over their confidential data to US providers who are subject to American laws , and thus to the capture of the NSA .
Last but not least , the vast movement of revelations initiated by media throughout the world , which contributes to a debate on the surveillance practices of the hitherto virtually non-existent intelligence services , could encourage legislators , including American legislators , to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services .
Parents of sexually motivated children can choose &apos; indetermined sex &apos;
Germany became the first European nation to recognise a third gender for infants born with ambiguous sex organs .
The male and female gender of the new born will no longer be allocated , in a rigid way , to birth .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child , allowing them to include an &apos; indetermined &apos; or &apos; no specified &apos; sex on its birth certificate .
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure that was placed on parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a surgical surgeon of sexual regeneration for their infants , and to combat discrimination against sexuality .
According to the BBC , an intersexy person would have said years later , &apos; I am neither a man nor a woman . &apos;
I will remain the patchwork that has been created by doctors , contrigued and brushed .
It is estimated that a child of 2 000 born every year is neither a boy nor a daughter .
They are sexually motivated , sexuality as part of the group of the 60 diseases diagnosed as a disorder of sexual development , a generic term that designates people with chromomomes or gluades ( ovres or mescules ) atypical or unabnormal sexual organs .
Simpson Simpson could have been intersexined .
Sexual identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined , it is better to use the best information available to award it , then to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act , if necessary .
Dr Jack Dresher , a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist on the issue of sexual identification , said that the new German law &apos; seems to be a good idea &apos; .
Sexual children pose an ethical dilemma .
&apos;Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act , but that is not the case with most children &apos; , he added .
It is possible to make sexual assignation without operation and to see how identity develops .
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
Nobody can answer the question as to why this is happening .
It is like the mystery surrounding gay people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the sexuals as different from transgender or transgender people , since their status is not linked to gender but rather to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively of a woman , but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either one or the other .
These characteristics can be shown by themselves in secondary sex terms , such as museum mass , steepness , chickens and stature , the primary sexual characteristics ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of chromium and hormones .
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by sexual and transgender people in employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and motivated crimes .
Non-compliant young boys now have camps that are specifically intended for them .
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to include male , female or third gender in their official documents .
In June , an Australian 52 years , Norrie May-Welby , became the first person in the world to have been recognised &apos; neutral &apos; after having won his trial trial that allows him to retain a &apos; non-specified &apos; gender .
German passports will include a third appointment other than M or F - X for sexuality , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a reporting broadcast to France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of lawmakers in this country of fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for &apos; gender theory &apos; to be withdrawn from school books .
The American Catholicic Online site also opposed the German law , writing that &apos; since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice , but where sexual activity is not one , two other pillars of civilisation are overturned . &apos;
In Maryland , the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth .
&apos;The role of parent is sufficiently stressed without any additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the gender of your child &apos; , she said on the website for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
Historically , children born without male or female sex bodies were called hermrops , according to the name of the beautiful Greek god , who had a double gender .
Just ten years ago , the medical community considered gender as an ardos , which can be deleted and which can be redrawn .
Now , however , many people are calling into question the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong , not knowing how a child will feel its sexual regeneration when it grows .
In the middle of the 20th century , it was called a psychiatric emergency .
When these children were born , you were not called psychiatrist , you were telephone surgeon .
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr John Money , the University of Johns-Hopkins , who considered gender to be malleable .
He devoted the term &apos; sexual identity &apos; and argued that social and environmental signals - the way in which parents raise a child - interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male and female .
But in a case of 1966 , known as John / Joan , his theories gave rise to controversy .
He had advised the parents of a small boy whose pain had been cut off in a glimpse circumcision to make him bury completely , and also to remove him from the mescules , and to raise it as a daughter .
&apos;Money presented this as a successful transition , but that was not the case &apos; .
At the age of 15 years he became a boy and married with a woman .
But , at 38 years , he followed .
He said that some doctors &apos; always repeat this model &apos; .
But in the 1990s , with the arrival of the Internet , those who survived these gender-change operations say &apos; they are not satisfied with the result &apos; .
This is the case of Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old writer of the Montana , who was born with male chromomes , but ambiguous sexual organs .
Doctors could not really say if he had a broad clichis or a little song and was convinced that he could never have a &apos; satisfactory life &apos; as a man .
So little time after its birth in 1976 , Bruce suffered a surgical abjection of the external body and of the mescules and was high as a daughter .
It has been taken by female hormones at the age of 12 .
&apos;I knew that I was not a daughter &apos; , he said about ABCNews.com.
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 years , he has suffered a vaginoplascope .
But depressed and realising that something was wrong , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horrified .
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me .
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( DDS ) , which prevented its body from producing enough testosterone for its sexual organs to develop .
Having learned the truth , he has become a man , following a treatment of testosterone and has taken the seins away .
The surgery made it sterile .
Today , he is defending the cause of others in an organisation known as Project Project , which tries to normalise the perception of sexuality .
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , the general leader of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Chaice , fears that German law &apos; calls for labelling and stigmatisation &apos; .
&apos;Many activists are worried that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child an &apos; indetermined &apos; gender , has said .
We are afraid that it encourages interventions .
We think it would be better to give a male or female gender and wait .
But we have not seen what the law is going to give , so we can only put forward hypotheses .
Tamar-Mats said that his organisation supported Australian law because &apos; it allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third gender name &apos; .
&apos;adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind &apos; .
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth .
It is not a battle that young children should lead to this age .
When they grow , they will be able to take decisions on their own bodies .
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a radiologist specialising in the mammographs in Pittsburgh , whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and which helps thousands of people in a support group , has said that the German law will &apos; make parents and children &apos; responsible .
The daughter of Dr Baratz , Key , was born with male chromioss , but suffers from a DDS known as complete insensitivity to andrages .
As a result of the failure of its andragenous receivers , Key has developed female characteristics .
It has a vagine , but it has no eggs or eggs .
Today , in the age of 29 years , Key is married and internal psychiatry in the University of Pennsylvania .
Even though it is sterile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or by carrying them .
&apos;The law gives parents a certain amount of latitude so that they do not have to make hasty decisions &apos; .
This gives them time to make certain tests and to understand them , and a deadline before putting &apos; male &apos; or &apos; feminine &apos; .
So everything is fine - you can raise your child and love it .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being relative .
You do not have to rush for surgical intervention that is irreversible .
&apos;This puts children at the heart of the decision and attends the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need &apos; .
Finally , the child will decide with what gender he feels the / most at ease - and that is something wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .
Letta on the longevity of its government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judge that his government will keep up to 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate &apos;s vote in favour of Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate .
In a daily interview with the Stampa , the center-left leader said &apos; firmly the intention &apos; to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015 .
The Italian Parliament &apos;s upper house will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August .
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate , where he has more adversaries than supporters , makes his ruling .
However , one part of its camp , grouped around the National Secretary of the Peoples of Freedom ( PDL ) , continues to support the government , as demonstrated by its refusal to give in to the orders of Berlusconi , which already wanted to bring down the cabinet , on 2 October .
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Safety Agency , TSA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire .
firemen called on the scene of the drama have said that they have responded to a call for &apos; multiple injuries &apos; .
&apos;The forces of order are on the spot &apos; , the airport &apos;s account of its Twitter account , while the television pictures show people evacuated in ambulances .
&apos;There was a shooty &apos; , declared to the AFP a spokesperson for the US Transport Safety Agency ( TSA ) .
The local antene of ABC showed a person who was evacuated on a shop , and a second transported on a wheelchair .
The incident took place at 9.30 p.m. ( 12.30 in Montreal ) at the terminal 3 of the airport , which also made the airport clear .
The Los Angeles Times says that tems 2 and 3 are being evacuated .
The TSA spokesman was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured .
All flights to arrival and from the airport were suspended .
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza-sthese
Israeli tanks were killed on Thursday by an Islamist Palestinian militant of Hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip .
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting in this region has erupted , because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and have been targeted by Palestinian morals .
The Israeli army has simply referred to a &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a so-called &apos; terrorist &apos; tunnel by the Jewish State , which is digging on the border and whose discovery was announced in the middle of October .
Report : Obama &apos;s campaign to allow Hiden
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers have considered , in the utmost secrecy , to replace Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This revelation is the most striking event in the very anticipated book of the 2012 campaign of Mark Halperin and John Heilann , &apos; Double Down : Game Cange 2012 &apos; .
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and said on Thursday evening that the President &apos;s close collaborators had carried out &apos; in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 &apos; to see whether Biden &apos;s eviction could help Obama with his re-election when his hopes were waning .
According to the Times Jonathan Martin political correspondent , the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials in the campaign and of the White House , namely the former General Secretary of the White Bill Bill Desey , to assess the effect of replacing the Vice-President with former Secretary of State Clinton .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept in the QG in Chicago and within the oval Bureau .
Only half a dozen close advisers from the President - in particular , Desey , Obama &apos;s former campaign leader Jim Messina and the former advisors to the White House David Axelrod and David Pleffe - knew that change was in the pipeline .
&apos;Double Down &apos; indicates that Desey has led the way to replace Biden , despite their &apos; close personal links &apos; , before finally deciding against change when the figures have shown that having Clinton on the presidential list â did not significantly improve Obama &apos;s chances of success . â
In an interview with Martin , Desey confirmed that the administration had indeed envisaged the replacement of Biden by Clinton .
&apos;I said that I had looked at a whole series of questions , and that was one of them &apos; , said Dealy in the newspaper .
Remember that , at that time , the President was not in form , and so we were told , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos;
As Desey called the &apos; concerted &apos; examination , Martin said to Mr Andersson of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a great deal in finding out whether change would be beneficial in the election .
&apos;The campaigns do not devote much money to polls and to discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action &apos; , said Martin on ACTA .
However , it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was looking at replacement .
Martin said on CNN that he asked Desey if his boss then knew about the possible overhaul .
Although Desey said he did not think the President was aware of the possible change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was &apos; possible &apos; that Obama knew .
Martin added that &apos; Double Down &apos; did not give a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had reached the Obama office .
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden &apos;s avoidance of Biden was examined .
&apos;Perhaps &apos; answered Martin .
Do you want a fluo ice ?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorestice ice in the world .
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorinated properties of this marine animal to develop a lukewarm collusion .
He had the idea after reading a study on the misses and persuaded Chinese scientists to recreate the brilliant protein .
The ice cream is reacting with language by increasing the pH of protein to make it brilliant .
Chris explains that , since the ice cream is beginning to read when it is reacting to the heat of the mouthpiece , the more it is left out , the more brilliant it becomes .
Charlie , the founder of the &apos; Lick Me Im Delicius &apos; company , said : &apos; It is something unbelievable , but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of that truc costs around 200 billion . &apos;
The protein we use in the ice reacts with a neutral language .
So when your mouthpiece warm protein , the level of pH is rising and the ice is blowing .
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all of us at the time of Hallween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice I have created , because the slump of the medus is worth four times more than gold .
Every butle costs me about GBP 140 .
But it is rather good !
The company &apos;s experimental approach to Charlie , based in Bristol , is known for its unusual ice fragrances , such as beer , cheese , beef and the gold leaf .
But its next creation is even more ambitious .
He added : &apos; I would really like to develop an invisible ice . &apos;
This is intrinsically impossible because of the split caused by the ice cracks that are the cream , but I think I will find a way of doing that .
The ice uses the fluorinated properties of the synthetics synthezed by Chinese scientists .
Lou Reed died during a tai
The songer Lou Reed died when he was running a coi exercise , revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the Regional newspaper &apos; Eastt Hampton Star &apos; and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Spreings , where the couple had a house .
The artist died last Sunday , at the age of 71 .
&apos;He died on Sunday morning , when he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st Shi &apos;i movement , with his hands of musician who foured the air &apos; , wrote Laurie Anderson .
Lou Reed was master , a Chinese martial art .
The singer &apos;s wife also explains that she promised her husband , the week before her death , to get him out of the hospital and to take it to the house of Sprlings ( Long Island ) .
Lou and I spent a lot of time here in recent years .
And even if we are citrats , it is our spiritual house .
&apos;Lou was a prince and a combatant , and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many people the great joy of life that he had &apos; .
Lou Reed last May suffered a liver transplant .
Hallweed in 2013 :
When I was a little , Hallween was magic .
My sister and I were allowed to eat bonuses , go late and disguise us to go to the neighbourhood .
Today , I have become more pink .
Over the last two years , I have not distributed a single bonus and I will certainly not do so this year .
But the statutes show that I am a black sheep when we talk about Hallween .
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will be celebrating Hallaween this year , spending a total of 6.9 Mdollars on bonuses , covert and decorations , according to the National Real Record .
What I look forward to with every celebration in Hallween is the trends .
Floods should represent USD 1.2 million over the 6.9 billion spent on the NRF .
This year , unanimated objects are furthering .
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals ; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas , hamburgers and carrots .
As far as men are concerned , I expect to see many zombies , thanks to the television series The Walking Dead , and I bet that the men of the space of Daft Punk will be among our photographs Instasgram this year .
According to Google , the most sought disguises are the zombies , Batman , pirates and sorceers .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disguised our dogs last year and , to my surprise , they were not the only ones .
In fact , the Americans will spend USD 330 in disguise this year , according to the NRF .
It has made many strange dogs disguised in hotdogas .
When it comes to bonuses , we are not slipping .
The Americans will spend USD 1.9 on good this year , according to the Nielsen cabinet .
This represents around 272 million kg of Hecey , succinct , Milk Duods , Twizlers and Clark .
It is a super-news for the 41 million children who go to the bonuses in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Trade .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not say , consume 41 million kg of chocolate in Hallalween .
Good maize is the only thing we do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Hallween , according to the National Confticioners Association .
This represents around 9 billion grain grain grain .
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to evade .
Nothing is more representative of Hallwelen than the Hanned houses .
They have the best names , such as &apos; Terror Behind the Wels &apos; ( which is actually a real prison ) , &apos; Howl-O-Sceam &apos; and &apos; The House of Shack &apos; .
In fact , there are 1 200 registered houses officially recognised in the United States , which generate around USD 500 million in revenue , according to the US High Representative , and this includes these wonderful photographs of you to pump you above your friends on Facebook , and you cannot take away and on which you like a commentary of a &apos; goose head &apos; .
Finally , let us talk about citrols .
Charlie Brown presented us with the Grose Ciutrille when you were gang , and sculpting a clandestine in the form of landings , it is like deceiving a Christmas tree - that is something that has been done since we are very small .
Thankfully for us , the &apos; yaw-cid &apos; trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us sculed these poles and did not have to sit down .
This year , the Americans will spend around USD 106 million on cicks , according to the U.S.
The shells that are dwindling on the dock of your house probably came from Illinois , where 542 million icks were grown this year .
If you seek to point out to you more , you call Tim and Suusan Mathisdon in Napa , California , and try to sculpper their citrols from 922 kg .
Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a structure of defiance ( &apos; baad bank &apos; ) amounting to GBP 38 billion ( EUR 45 billion ) of the most risky assets , a measure that is designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its privatisation .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55 % to 70 % in the next two years and hopes to clean up it completely within three years .
RBS also said that it would include a vision for depreciating the additional dubious debt of four to Â£ 4.5 billion in the quarter , a writing linked to the formation of the canning structure .
RBS also made it clear that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion capital books , thus strengthening its ability to lend .
The bank and London have pointed out that the &apos; bad bank &apos; would be able to draw a line in the past , with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS .
&apos;We can now move forward , concern ourselves with the future and 90 % of the assets that are a truly good bank and build a large bank for customers and for the United Kingdom &apos; , said the new Director-General Ross McEowa to the press .
Land Rover
Internally , there are only 6 points in the internal system and there is an Intercom system .
Among the options , such as improved brakes , a service that gives access to Bowler Works &apos; mechanics , logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events .
Drew Bowler , the Director-General of Bowler Motorport said : &apos; The amateur amateurs who join Bowler have changed . &apos;
They are not all experienced , some are seeking excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events .
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA , and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to try different forms of cracks in the United Kingdom and the international world , and to prepare for the shores and realities of the raids .
We had a great deal of pleasure in developing the Defder Challenge vehicle - the championship is going to be palpable .
In addition , Dr Challenge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East .
The fire brigades were called to rescue a lost chiot after remaining stuck at 15 m above the soil on an unstable corniche in a career career in a career .
RÃ©by , a cocky , had escaped after a traffic accident without gravity .
She was returned three days later by a person who promised his dog in the career of a career .
The fire brigade took on the cliff to recover the Chilean and save it from a certain death .
A chiot had the chance to get out of the worst after the fire brigades were called to recover safely when it was lost at 15 m above the soil on the unstable season of a cliff .
Ruby , a cocky of 9 months , escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days only before being rescued in a career on Wednesday .
His owners , Scott Alderson , 25 years , and his little friend Beckey Hall , 20 years ago , went to the career of FlÃ©lille in Dgenolme in the West Yorkshire , to find RÃ©by and thanked West Yorkshire .
They had desperately sought their lost chip and launched an appeal on social networks after it disappeared into a career following an unserious accident .
Towards 14.15 on Wednesday , a person with a strong view who promoted his dog took Ruby on a cornche in the career , coined at 15 m above the soil .
A technical rescue team of the Clarkheaton fire brigade has been ruined in the places and has gone down in order to save Rby by using a animal civic to transport it to the top of the cliff .
The expert expert Any Clayton said : &apos; She was in a precarious situation . &apos;
She was in the middle of the cliff , at 15 m of the summit and 15 m .
It did not budge at all during the rescue - it was frozen .
But it is going well now .
She has eaten biscuits after .
It was a very unusual appeal .
It is incredible that someone noticed the dog .
The technical assistance expert Peter Lu said : &apos; Rby has had a great deal of opportunity to get out of it unscathed &apos; .
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ruby was conducted in the veterinarian for control ; his general state was satisfactory , apart from exhaustion and dehydration .
Miss Hall , Halifax in the West Yorkshire , said : &apos; I was terrified by observing the aid &apos; .
First of all , I did not believe that it was there .
It was surprising to have it again .
The veterinarian has said that if it had been too exhausted and evaded , it would probably have fallen .
The fire brigades were wrecked .
What they have done was really courageous .
They are so grateful , each has been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Alderson , from Keighley , added : &apos; You were afraid that it was falling but it did not move . &apos;
The fire brigades were supposed .
I cannot believe that it was there .
MicroJager says he has never dragged Katy Perry when it was 18 years old .
In an interview during an Australian radio programme this week , the pop star said that it was a chorus on the song of Jagger &apos; Old Habes Die Hard &apos; in 2004 .
Perry said that he had drunk with the rock and explained , &apos; he dragged me when I was 18 years &apos; .
It added , &apos; it was a long time ago , and it was very good &apos; .
In a statement on Thursday , a representative of Jagger , 70 years , said that he &apos; categorically denies having made advances in Katy Perry &apos; .
The representative added : &apos; Perhaps it confuses it with someone else &apos; .
Perry was one of the chants to come to an end when the Rolling Stones turn this year .
His new albulm , &apos; Prism &apos; , landed at the first place of the charts this week .
Beijing is challenging an Islamic Islamic movement
&apos;Support behind the attack has come from the Eastern Turkestan Movement based in Central and Western Asia &apos; , declared the boss of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television channel , according to a video online on Thursday evening on a website .
Meng Jianzhu , who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party Party ( CCP ) , was speaking in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time that a Chinese official has appointed a particular organisation after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three Uighurs of the same family in the Muslim dominant region of Xinjiang , a border of several Central Asian countries , precipitated their car with petrol against the entry of the City banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that claimed two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and mother died in the car fire .
The Etim , which declares to fight for the independence of East Turkestan , a former name of Chinese Xinjiang , was ranked by the UN in 2002 among affiliated al-Qaeda organisations .
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George Kerevan : Europe &apos;s break-up gives the Scots a choice
Another day , another worrying history of independence .
This time we are warning that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU .
Now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed border of wire wire along the Hadun wall .
It is true that the newspaper in Strathclyd has indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , but it was not in the headlines ( and that was to be predicted ) .
Nobody has said that the EU Member States devote much of their time to circumventing their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , a continuous breach of the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything that it wants to obtain from Scots .
So it is a story that is not one .
And a history that is so old that it is now fixed : I have heard for the first time the brass that &apos; independence means passport control &apos; more than 40 years ago .
However , an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of an old dust tale .
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe , in fact ?
Why exchange the yoke of London against Brussels , especially now ?
This is the real news about Europe : the great post-war plan to unify Europe is finally dead .
With the euro crisis , the Europe Project is officially dead .
Throughout Europe , the parties that oppose the EU or are fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Alternative Alternative Party for Germany , founded only this year and arrived from nowhere , brought together almost five million votes in the September federal elections and came out of the Liberal Democratic Party ( the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , together with the straitjacket on national economies through accession to the single currency , has led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits - that was only true of Greece .
Instead , the European system has put its members of exchange rates favourable to German exporters - what German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the countries of southern Europe have an intrinsic productivity problem vis-Ã -vis Germany .
The only use is to make cuts in wages and public spending - promoted by Berlin .
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe .
Following the &apos; green &apos; energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason to subsidise French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States .
This is an inhibiting disadvantage in terms of costs , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .
Not all wage managers in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap US shale gas .
As a result , the grey revolt , particularly in France , is one of the EU &apos;s great leaders .
After the war , the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and bringing Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy to get off the ground .
As a result , the extreme right-wing party of Marine Le Pen , the National Front National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , leaving the socialists to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically encourage the left .
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity in the French white working class ?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single , anti-European , anti-European and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament .
If the anti-European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will come back to something that will look more like &apos; the Europe of the Nations ( sovereign ) &apos; , which General de Gaulle has preferred .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency .
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project , and I hope that it will give the United States a soft eyes .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending out Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries similar to similar views would be easier in a Europe of non-federal Nations .
Otherwise , we should imitate Norway and retain our economic independence .
The SNP government of Scotland is - and this is to be noted - the anti-austerity political movement that has been the most successful in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 , based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Chancellor of the Labour chesser , Allisir Darling , and the Conservative / Liberal Democrats that followed .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
Earlier :
Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of the peninsula earlier than white girls .
Practical changes do not mean that the puberty is imminent .
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible for that .
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger of early punishments .
The trend towards early punishments is not as pronounced in boys as boys .
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist journalist in family and health issues in the child .
Does a mother have to worry if his daughter &apos;s seals and pools are starting to grow to 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando , Florida , Dr Paul Kaplowitz , child endocrinologists , explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American people and represent a new standard .
&apos;I take a long time to reassure parents - in general , that does not indicate a rapid change to the full punch &apos; .
The obvious signs of development , such as the quagmire of seins , poles under arms and the pubial area and body oths , appear earlier in girls .
But there was only a slight advance of the age of the first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , while it was 12 years in 1970 .
&apos;Once the chest has begun to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear &apos; , he said Kaplowitz , also the author of the &apos; Elly Puberty in Girls &apos; : The Essential Guide to Coping .
Time is the most precise test of how the chip is going .
There is a debate about what is the real appearance of the chip , but it is regarded as &apos; early &apos; when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development slows down or stops - that is something that a paediatrician can follow closely .
More rapid development can justify tests carried out by endoinologists to remove serious problems such as tumours or kysts .
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : premature ageing of the os that can curb growth and a small amount of adulthood .
recommendations for medicinal and hormone treatment are based on the age of the child , the development rate , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
The psychosocial aspects are also important .
Kaplowitz is cautious with medicines but recognises that &apos; control of the puberty can alleviate some of the problems of behaviour and sensation for young girls to be different from others &apos; .
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
&apos;They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they are going to manage hygiene issues &apos; , said Kaplowitz .
&apos;It was a shock &apos; , remember a woman whose daughter had its first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , it was not prepared emotionally .
She returned from the frightened and shaky school to be the first among her friends .
There are many theories to public knowledge about the causes of the early warning .
However , there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible .
boys , like girls , reach their punishments earlier .
Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He took part in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9 , which links the percentage of fat mass to the outbreak .
Other discoveries support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the pensioner age earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
At a global level , the early warning mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything , economic conditions in the climate and genes .
Another problem is that , although boys have poles on the face and in the younger pubie area , the trend towards real early pubs is not as pronounced as girls .
Other doctors involved in the APP Conference stressed the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the acid and pole poles is common , even in infants and small .
&apos;We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of the puberty &apos; , said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a child of endocrinologist working in the hospital for children Goryeb in Morristoown , in the New Jersey .
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatrics to know how to speak with their children .
&apos;This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned &apos; , explained Kaplowitz .
If you remain calm , your child will respond in general .
The daughters of early care must be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected , the process is part of life .
The Outcome of the Boen brothers
&apos;Inside Llewn Davis &apos; of the Coen brothers , Grand Price of Cannes &apos; last Festival , is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenhich village of 1961 and the mad music that was just beginning to resonate , before Bob Dylan arrived .
Joel and Ethan Coen , whose filmmography has just been the subject of retrospective to the French Hemathan , threw the gold Palma in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink .
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the Trio Peter , Paul and Marly , Joel and Ethan Coen threw them on the rising stars of American film , Oscar Isaac , 33 years , but also on the global star pop Timp Timberlake .
In this movie movie of humour where music is a central figure and the misinterpreted songs , Oscar Isaac is proving a musician and scrap of folk , while Timberlake , his friend in the film , is leaving the pop for mad music with a jubilation .
As for Carey Mullilian , she left the rich awards of Daily Mullian in &apos; Gatsby the wonderful &apos; for less relaxed clothes , a soft voice when she cherishes , but the debtor debtor was debited when she talks .
&apos;Inside Llewn Davis &apos; tells a week about the tribunals of a crazy singer who is unable to persevere and fade with the whole earth .
It accepts the replacement of the seizure in the studios .
Without housing , he has turned the cane of his friends who want to receive it .
A documentary air
&apos;His relationship with success is tortured , that is what we were interested in : a mixture of misfortune , a boy that is not at the right moment , not a careers , but one that incorporates , with self-destructive behaviour &apos; , declared to the Ethan Coen press , crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prize in Cannes .
If Llewyn Davis did not exist , the two fans of mad music built their history on real personalities like the mad musician Dae Von Ronk .
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village , this New York headquarters called &apos; the epicentre of the rise of mad music that would lead to international stars &apos; , as the journalist Elijh Wald , a friend of van Ronk , wrote .
The film then takes documentary breeds , the dust music label invaded 33T invented by an old , imparable secretary , the musical choices of the times and the cafÃ©s where the singers came from .
The magic of the Co-Chaen brothers is still operating by including a fungle who is going through the film on a permanent basis : a wonderful cat in the eyes of Llewyn Davis .
Out of the way in which he made up his character , the actor and singer Jutine Timberlake had reminded us that he had &apos; grown up in the Tennessee , baked by the blight and crown &apos; .
&apos;My first lessons of music were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guest &apos; , he added .
For Justin Timberlake , if the work is necessary to &apos; be regarded as good &apos; , &apos; chance can also launch someone &apos;s career &apos; and &apos; more and more today &apos; .
Like Llewyn Davis , who refuses to compromise on his music , the trap pop explains that in a career , &apos; the most important thing is not to be caught by everything that can prevent us from speaking &apos; .
GÃ©rard de Villiers , the author of &apos; SAS &apos; , is dead .
He will never have known the word &apos; retirement &apos; .
The French edition of the French edition , GÃ©rard de Villiers , who died on Thursday to 83 years , had just published his 200th SAS , &apos; The Kremlin &apos;s Venger &apos; .
In February , the New York Times devoted it as &apos; the nose brother who knew too much &apos; .
It then took ten days in Afghanistan , the theatre of 198 and 1994 , which was the famous series of spying novels .
Out physically , by a very serious cardiac accident in December 2010 , he was travelling on this journey with a ambulance .
And before Afghanistan , it was also party to Libya , Russia , Lebanon and Mali .
With four SAS published a year , GÃ©rard de Villiers , born on 8 December 1929 in Paris , ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of &apos; SAS in Istanbul &apos; , the first of the series , almost half a century ago .
&apos;Undoubtedly between 120 and 150 million of all countries , &apos; he said last March .
His cat in Burma on the knees , in his huge apartment of a Foch Fish building to two steps from the Arc of Trimee , the malignant eye under his white hair , he mentioned a few of the languages in which SAS &apos;s adventures were translated : Italian , German , Russian , Greek , Japanese or Korean .
&apos;Leave the pirate publishers &apos; , he said , designing a pound of books on the low table between the brons or the ivets reported by the 130 countries that had been aroused to place their novels there .
For the price of a cigarette packet , the reader is entitled to traditional coverage with the photograph of a young woman at the advantageous chest , wearing a gun or a gun .
Internally , its serennial allegiance ( SAS ) Prince Malko Linge , Austrian aristocrat , and the CIA contractual agent to pay for the reparations of the family castle , is embarking on the heroes of all the desks of the earth , Communists of the 1970s and 1980s , and then jihadis from the 1990s .
In every book , the same recipe : a great deal of geopolitics and exotism , a few same-sex scenes , a zesty of violence and torture .
&apos;I have never had the claim to be a literary author &apos; , explained GÃ©rard de Villiers .
I regard myself as a provider who writes for distracting people to whom I do not send a message .
He was working &apos; like the major pre-war reporters , of the type Albert London , who went on and returned with real and long investigations &apos; .
The father of SAS said &apos; to make a kind of geopolitical soap &apos; .
&apos;I am constantly on my files ( Afghanistan , Syria , ... ) before leaving &apos; , added GÃ©rard de Villiers .
On the ground , I meet journalists , including those of the AFP , diplomats , people of the services I have known for some for 20 or thirty years .
As a result , many of its SAS are often preposterous : so , a month before the attack by a command centre of the Syrian regime killed several senior officials , he told the story in &apos; The Chemine in Damascus &apos; .
In &apos; Benghazi &apos; , he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in that city , the cradle of the Libyan uprising .
In 1980 , he called for the murder of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in &apos; the plot in Cairo &apos; , a year before the attack .
In October 2012 , in &apos; Panic in Bamaako &apos; , he reported the columns of 4X4 of jihadis who were based on the malian capital .
I am not one of them , defended GÃ©rard de Villiers , I am simply hypotheses from countries that I know well and from time to time some of my assumptions are being realised .
After these journeys in often troubled areas , he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM to marsherite dating from 1976 , whose parts were changed &apos; .
300 pages later , he wrote the word &apos; IUU &apos; and corrected every page in pen .
At the walls of his office are clinging to AK-47 guns , photographs and photographs of the author with African warlords .
GÃ©rard de Villiers was reminded of the accusations in two sentences .
Some women are sexual objects in my books , but others are beautiful , smart and courageous women .
I am always very welcome in Africa , where I have many readers .
GÃ©rard de Villiers said : &apos; Malko Linge , like all heroes , has no age &apos; .
He will not die and retire .
Nor do I .
Flookers are struggling with the width of seats when large orders are at stake at stake .
The dispute is raging between the large aviation companies about the width of the tourist class seats on long-running flights , paving the way for a bitter confrontation in the Dubai aeronautical Salon which is taking place in the month .
The conflict relates to the width of the seats proposed on long-run flights to passengers in the economic class - which are not always the most crowned by the airlines , but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the last devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .
This week Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard of at least 18 hens ( 45.72 cm ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Boeing says that it should be up to the airlines to decide .
The dispute broke out when the greers were seeking to sell even bigger versions of their long-running long-run aircraft , hoping perhaps for a record record in the event of 17 to 21 November .
The way in which the seats will go down the plane - in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats head-on - is essential for the economic performance of the &apos; mini twin &apos; segment .
Boeing says that the redesigned 777X will be able to host 406 people in seats of more than 17 hens and will be configured with 10 seats .
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in an economic class in seats of 18 hens in the middle of 9 .
The giants of aeronautics often trade in technical matters by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus is directly appealing to the public before the Dubai aeronautical Salon , where 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We have seen recently what might be the start of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photograph showing three people against one another in the restaurant , entitled &apos; would you accept that ? &apos;
&apos;Boeing proposes long-run flights in smaller seats than in regional turbopropelsers &apos; , indicated John Leahy , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people are growing , but the seats in aircraft have not changed radically .
Between the beginning of the 1970s , when the twin 747 of Boeing defined the modern long-distance journey , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .
The average turn of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 hens , according to US health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival is clinging to a concept of siege that dates back to the 1950s , when the fresh-jet package was closer .
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional boost to the width of seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53 % .
Boeing the Airbus figures in relation to the width of seats and says that it is not for manufacturers to decide how the airlines are balancing the price of tickets and equipment .
He also says that the study shows that in cabin experience depends not only on the width of seats .
&apos;It is really a matter of providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , said Kent Casser , who is responsible for the passengers &apos; satisfaction at Boeing .
They do not want to be told what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more about having a certain freedom of movement , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft for an estimated amount of at least USD 700 Mdollars at the price of the market in decades to come , enough to look at the balance of US and European exports .
As Reuters said for the first time in July , the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last appliances .
Airbus and Boeing are both in favour of a return per seat in their latest models of long-run long-running bimers than the market leader in this segment , the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats .
The performance announced by Boeing is partly dependent on the comparison between 777X configurated with 10 seats per row and a model 777 of the origin of 9 .
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared with the device that has been configured with 10 seats currently in service .
&apos;Boeing is doing that in order to be able to cap more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products &apos; , said Kevin Kenison , Director of Constrong Passer in the European poultry carrier .
On the other hand , the analysts say that cabin booths with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more dense configuration , which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs .
&apos;An 18-bn seat is perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777 &apos; , has declared the internal expertise of the Dy Kirby , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers , including airlines .
Aircraft vendors who go around the world even take a metre to check the competing configurations .
While selling itself to offer comfortable appliances , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional trips .
Airbus provides an A350 configuration with 10 seats , but says that it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus highlighted the need for greater personalization of cabins by offering larger seats to some of its aircraft .
Without the support of the only other large manufacturers of modern appliances , the experts say that it is unlikely that its call for the aviation industry to put in place a high standard for the seats will be successful , but that it could make the sales wave of 777X forget .
The shareholders of Orira
A majority of the company &apos;s shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and Director-General Larry Elison , in view of the financial performance of his group .
The vote is not binding , but it is a testament to the image of Larry Ellison , a third global fortune , just as a result of the victory of its boat in the American Cup .
The billionaire still holds 25 % of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago .
As long ago as last year , Elison had a negative vote on its remuneration .
The Orale boss gave up a bonus of USD 1.2 million for the 2013 financial year closed in May because of the poor performance of the group , which has missed its growth targets , but it has seen around USD 77 million in store .
Its fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar .
On the whole period of 2013 , the net benefit of the Orale has grown by 3.5 % , while the stock market price of 27.5 % , which is overperforming the S &amp; P 500 index , has taken 24 % at the same time .
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking .
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine which could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse of dependence on nicotine .
Other tests are needed before we start tests on human beings , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Medical College in New York said that the first signs were encouraging .
&apos;We really hope that this kind of vaccinal strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , using all the methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches &apos; , said Professor Cornell .
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been amended to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies .
The virus is selectively infecting the liver cells , which is then starting to produce a regular stream of antibodies .
The antibodies are tracking all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralising them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine .
In the tests , the vaccinated mice to which the nicotine was subsequently given was carried out normally .
But the mouse who had not been vaccinated &apos; were affluent &apos; said the researchers , a sign that nicotine had reached their brains .
The experiences are described in the journal Science TransLatin Medicine .
Previous vaccines against tobacco have proved to be ineffective because they contain antibodies .
Injections had to be repeated so frequently so that antibodies remain high that they were too expensive and inconvenient .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies .
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use were completely safe , it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nicotine .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
&apos;They will know that if they start smoking , they will not take any pleasure in the anti-nicotine vaccine , and that can help them to lose their bad habit &apos; .
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have pointed out that much more in-depth research is needed .
Pakistani Taliban leader
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , Hakimullah Mehsouth , was killed in an American drone on Friday in Pakistan , has been learned from the security services .
Hakimullah Mehsouth &apos;s death has been announced several times in the past .
But those responsible for intelligence , the army and the activist movement have said this time that they have lost their lives in this strike , conducted in the North Waziristan region .
&apos;We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsouth has been killed in a drone &apos; .
On the eve , Pakistan &apos;s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , travelling to London , informed the British Government that discussions had been initiated with the Thrik Pakistan ( TTP ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tripodi
The former Labour Minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state &apos;s anti-corruption regulator .
Former Minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi has denied that he has changed trade policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden interests in three items in the government controlled .
On Friday , the Independent Committee on the Againt Corruption ( CCC ) broadened its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had put pressure on several state ministers to renew his balls in Circular four , where the Obemid had two restaurants and a coffee after their expiry in August 2005 , without any invitation to tender .
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr Tripodi , Lynne Ashpole , on Thursday .
In the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government pressed for the bones to be called for .
The tenants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , the bars concerning Circular four companies , which related to the Obemids about 2.5 Mdollars per year , were renewed without any invitation to tender .
Mr Tripodi , who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of tenders .
But he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid , who acknowledged Mr Tripodi , calling for a change in government policy .
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed appeals in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid , Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid in the Ministry of Fisheries .
&apos;The subject under discussion during these telephone conversations was the development of trade policy policy &apos; .
&apos;No &apos; , responded to Mr Tripodi .
I do not remember what we have discussed but , in any case , it was not .
In any case , certainly not between me and Mr Obeid .
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria , declaring a responsible person responsible
Israeli warplanes have reached a target in the Syrian port city in Latakia on Thursday evening , confirming a military officer in Fox News .
The person responsible did not specify what the target was , but said that there was at least one .
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125 .
At least twice this year , Israel has carried out air strikes against missile cargoes in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have a &apos; authenticity &apos; test .
The government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a &apos; authenticity &apos; test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa when it envisages extending the repressive measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion to prevent visas from 457 to be used to occupy unskilled posts or as a back door to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A working paper of the government was unveiled today , while the Labour MEP Muxine McKew was denouncing the government speech on foreign workers , saying that it could offend Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&apos;Smarcant statements on &apos; foreigners returning to the end of the queue &apos; and &apos; jobs for the Australians first &apos; are a unpleasant return when the trade unions called for a protected labour market , and told the Australian Indian Institute today .
Historically , this meant that the work of the White Paper was to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historic artent .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by the former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen .
The Minister of Immigration Brenan O &apos;Connor , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being under consideration .
If the &apos; authenticity &apos; criterion was adopted , a visa seeker could be controlled to know &apos; if the offer of employment is authentic in the case of the candidate being a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person in the company who sponsors it &apos; .
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 , after some of them , having intended to sponsor a small number of workers , actually used hundreds of them .
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart crisis after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers on the island of Christmas this week .
The starving son of man , aged 9 , went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an adulterated cousin that was also on board .
man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital in the island of Christmas , where he died .
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of Ph1 1 in 2026 .
The Transport Minister barred Kramer said that the project would bring together the United Kingdom .
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said &apos; excited &apos; to the idea of working with the British Government on the project .
Phasse 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands .
When PHARE 2 is completed , the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from GBP 32.7 to 42.6 .
The British Government , which is in talks with Scotland , asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of the journey for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of three hours .
Baroness Kramer said : &apos; Our objective for HS2 is about a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &apos;
We are pushing the HS2 project because the advantages it presents are enormous .
Without him , we are faced with a problem with our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 large British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Allistar Carmchael , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland &apos; .
In the case of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown called on Mr Caremicel to unequivocally support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network .
Mr Brown said : &apos; high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland to the overall high-speed rail network across Britain .
&apos; We are therefore excited about working in partnership with the British Government to examine the options for bringing the high-speed rail network to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgo-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
&apos;I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps . &apos;
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia at the moment .
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and smarphons during take-off and landing despite the US gesture to relax the regulation of electronic devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to US carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch videos or play games on their appliances during critical flight phases , provided that they are &apos; aircraft &apos; .
Passengers can already do this during the largest part of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during take-off and landing .
Australian hauliers are examining the decision that obliges US carriers to carry out an important job in order to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Aviation Authority has also stated that it is examining the announcement but has pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia .
&apos;The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft &apos; .
The issue is the subject of a regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained permanently and passengers comply with the safety requirements of crew members .
Virgin , which has already spoken to CASA about its intention to extend the use of its entertainment system on board Wi Fi , was open to change , but said it would follow the regulator .
&apos;We would welcome a review of the CASA which would allow the use of electronic devices because we really do believe that this would improve the customer &apos;s experience now that we have - the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology on our aeroplanes &apos; .
Quttas said that the current rules were respected at the moment .
&apos;In line with our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing , and we do not intend to change that immediately , but has said .
The FAA decision applies to US airlines .
However , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it .
For US carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as review textbooks , training equipment , the transport of hand baggage and the instructions provided to passengers .
&apos;As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use lightweight electronic devices , such as tablets , electronic pounds and smarphphes to all alabilities &apos; , has declared the FAA .
In the few cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to extinguish their equipment during the landing .
The group has also recommended that heavier appliances be placed safely under the seats or in higher compartments during take-off and landing .
Cia : at least four injured in a violent baggage
There has been an unusually high fever on Thursday evening .
There are three gendarmerie vehicles , two ambulances and a stumbling block of 30 people , depending on the evidence collected ...
On this day of Hallween , the evening has been agitated on the side of Piia , where a rixy involving several people broke out on the Post side .
There are , at least , four legs at least .
AlertÃ©s , policemen have been there to separate the warring parties and to ensure that the injured are taken care of .
Credit lenders
A lender of the Bendemeer commercial centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthinga is putting a brake , a joke and a pack of gold buttles to pay the school fees of his daughters .
&apos;My husband and I have just bought a house , so my money is party &apos; , says Mrs Amirthala .
Although it earns USD 3 000 ( $ 2 400 ) per month as a driver and her husband is also working , the monthly family income is not enough .
In fact , demand is such in parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is rising - that ValumeMax , where she has carried out her transaction , has become the third loan loan company to be introduced on the Singapore market this week .
Putting together bickers is not just a quick way to obtain cash money - $ 1 300 in Singapore in the case of Ms Amirthalinga - but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
In general , the loan lenders from Singapore raise an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % offered by the United Overseas Bank , a local fund provider with a branches in the same commercial centre .
However , credit lenders have the advantage of not asking for creditworthiness or wage proof , and can release loans faster than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region are turning to the lenders , while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers .
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fuelled by a monetary policy that is too lax in advanced economies , low-income and middle-income families are turning to lending lenders to bridge the difference when their economies are slowing down .
This week , the Standard &amp; Poorse rating agency cited the growing household debt , resulting mainly from the rise in mortgages , as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt ratio of the highest gross domestic product / GDP in Asia .
Malaysia comes at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , whereas the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has recently emerged from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
The balance sheet is that , with the rise in costs , people in the middle or the bottom are seeking to supplement their income as they can , declares Song Seng Wn , an economist at ICMB , a Malaysian bank .
The historically high gold prices over the last two years have meant that people have been quick to bring their personal effects to bear in order to affect the value of their jewels .
In Singapore , around 70 % of the articles put in place in the 200 shops on the basis of the cement state are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us bring the gold chain to a grandmother and we will be looking for it next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest loan operator , EasyMoney , recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using their shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the loan sector that ValumeMax , the Bendemeer operator and 15 other shops like the one in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where there are already four shops - but also outside Asia , declares Yeah Lee King , the Director-General .
The company will finance them by using 60 % of the USD 66 in Singapore that it rose this week when it was introduced on the Singapore grant .
While some of the low interest lenders have suffered criticism of the exorbitant interest rates that they practise , Miss Yeah indicates that the upbringing is not only lower rates than other lenders , but that , in addition , it does not directly increase the debt .
The customers are selling goods that they already have , and monetizing their personal goods does not increase household debt .
It is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term .
The people who go to lenders are not just those who have financial problems .
The well-off people of Singapore are also going in the loan shops on ValumeMax to bring in gold leingers or Rolex monsters , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase prices in cash .
We see customers from all sections of society .
&apos;It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial or investment activities , or small businesses that have cash needs to go a difficult course &apos; , adding Miss Yeah .
Sometimes they just need money very quickly .
Being accused of child pornography in New Scotland
A pasteer who took care of young people in the Halifax region in New Scotland is accused of pornography .
Aaron Hudgins , 30 years old , was arrested on Friday morning following searches at home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works .
The baptist Church of Timberlay , where the patchy is an officer , is deeply saddened by this news .
In a statement , those responsible for the church indicate that Mr Hudgins resigned from his post .
The Pope was released under conditions .
In particular , it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet .
It will appear in provincial court , in Halifax , in December .
It goes to the supermarket uniformly , before being driven out of the market .
A man who is dressed by a Nazi uniformed uniformist with the gaseous cross was asked to leave an English supermarket , customers complained to the directorate of the establishment that called the police , indicated the shop on Friday .
&apos;We have received a number of customers &apos; complaints , so we have asked him to leave the shop &apos; , explained a spokesperson for the supermarkets &apos; supermarkets .
The shop called on the police to rescue them , but &apos; the time it arrives , it had already gone unheeded &apos; .
I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed to be upset .
People were the mouthpiece .
&apos;You do not get out of the streets unless you wanted to draw attention &apos; , a clichÃ© , Rosina Rusin , 60 years ago in the Cambridge News .
This incident took place on Thursday , Day of Hallwelen , where it is customary to dress up in monster , but it was difficult to know whether it was a channel .
A man in Cambridge claimed the responsibility for this act on his Twitter account , where he presented pictures of Adolf Hitler .
&apos;I have a black bassard SS twice a week for three years in Asda &apos; , claimed Paul Dutton , explaining &apos; mental problems &apos; .
A rescue plan of USD 325 for the Tasmania health system
The Federal Government maintains that the rescue plan of USD 325 for the vile health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the government government will not waste the funds .
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic disease and the constraints of the system .
The funding , planned for four years , was decided after the government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania , Andrew Wilkie .
&apos;The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which , in our opinion , will resolve the unique difficulties that the State is facing &apos; , said Mrs Plibersek today .
The $ 325 $ 325 plan includes a campaign of 31 MFA for non-urgent surgical operations .
There are 2 600 additional operations , particularly in the area of orthoric surgery and the catartaking , which will help catch up .
Funds are also provided for clinics without meetings in Hobart and Launceston , better external care , training of medical frameworks , health care services and the deployment of electronic medical records in local hospitals .
&apos;These investments respond to the idea that , according to the first-line clinicians , it is the best way of treating the health system in Tasmania &apos; , said Mrs Plibersek .
The Minister said that the government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict regime for preparing reports and reporting .
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it is spending additional funds .
A committee of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides the services as efficiently and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wilkie has said today that the USD 325 will not count for very much &apos; unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania &apos; .
However , he congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance that he presented to Prime Minister early May .
&apos;I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing the public health system from the blacklist &apos; , said Mr Wilkie .
According to the state government , these non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
However , the opposition spokesperson for the health opposition Peter Dutton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a &apos; fortune solution &apos; .
&apos;The reason why we are here is that the State Labour Government has withdrawn USD 430 from its health system &apos; , he said on ABC TV .
We cannot have a government of the state that is grubbing up almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts USD 300 , and pretend that it is a good day .
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .
The adaptation by Guillaume Nikex of Denis Diderot &apos;s novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a careful recovery of times , but it is also more difficult than it should be .
In France in the 1760s , it told the dark story of Suzann , a young aristocrat who was sent to a cover by his family .
When it is refine , it is faced with the ruthless cruelty of a deliberately sadly sadic Mother , and is becoming an object of erotic fascination for another .
The film never pays in lubricity or sensationalism , and that is the problem .
The conscientious nature of narrowing could also become a penny for the public .
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , declares the supervisory body .
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions , declared the international monitoring body for chemical weapons on Thursday , when violent clashes were raging in the north of the country , near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian militants also said on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago .
The announcement of the Organisation for the prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OIC ) came to an end in advance on the deadline of the deadline of the end of the day .
1 November set by the organization based in The Hague ordered Damascus to destroy or &apos; make &apos; all chemical weapons production units and machinery designed to migrate toxic gases and to fill munitions .
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014 .
With the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
It is believed that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons , including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was raging on Thursday in the town of Safira , which , according to the experts , is home to a unit of chemical weapons and storage sites , reported the Syrian Monitoring Centre on Human Rights based in Britain .
The group of activists , which is following the development of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria , said on Thursday that 120 296 people were dead .
Among them , there are 61 067 civilians , including 6 365 children .
On the government side it is estimated that 29 954 members of President Bashar al-Assad &apos;s armed forces have died , 18 678 of whom were fighters of pro-government forces and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants .
Of the dead , it is also estimated that 2 202 were desertors and some 5 375 opposition fighters , many of whom were foreign .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since .
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict .
Assad &apos;s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to Al Qaeda groups , in Safira for weeks .
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but there was no clarification .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that is continuing , within tight deadlines .
A statement by the OIC , which works in close cooperation with the UN , indicated that its team was &apos; now happy to have controlled - and seen destroyed - all the declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling &apos; .
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was planned for the moment &apos; .
Earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus .
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety , have indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the ICAO said that the two sites were , according to Syria , &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they were happy with had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspected &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the unit of Safira was one of the two sites that the OIC inspectors were unable to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for full destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved in the month following the IOC Executive Committee .
&apos;I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organisation &apos; , declared the Director-General of the organisation Ahmet Uzucu , in a comment published by the OIC .
Now in its third year , the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels in the al-Assad Government and its security forces , which are supported by members of the Alawite sect , a branch of Shia Islam .
On the other hand , the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory has said that there has been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .
The cause of the explosion is unknown .
Occasionally caused by the sentence against one of the Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice , saying that Umar Patk should be shoed by an exchequer .
Patk , who spent almost 10 years on the flight as one of the most sought men in South-East Asia , was yesterday sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosives used in the attacks .
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two boxes in the popular tourist district in Kuta , which killed 202 people , including 88 Australians , and made many injured .
It has also been convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The prosecutors have asked for a sentence of life imprisonment , yet they could have asked that the man , called &apos; Dan Man &apos; for his reputation as an expert on bombs , should be sentenced to death .
The decision has revived painful memories for Ja Corteen , a mother of Peith who lost his two twin twins of 39 years , Jane and Jenny , in the destruction of Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago .
On the verge of tears , she said that Patk should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men .
&apos;He should be dragged in front of the execution &apos; , said Mrs Corteen to the APP .
I have to live every day without any other grandchildren or see my daughter .
Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , which was charged in an out-gas band , exploded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in Padddos Bar when a suicide bomber made a sack on his dos for explosives just 20 seconds earlier .
He sank in a coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month , and he is &apos; dead &apos; three times when he was under respiratory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that Patk should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage - Amrozi , Muklas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
To keep it alive , why there is no reason to keep it alive .
Passing 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others is not much .
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbotrid , where US forces will kill the former al-Qaeda leader , Osama bin Laden , less than four months later .
During the trial , an FBI agent said that reports of intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bin Laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in South-East Asia and al-Qaeda .
&apos;He did not go &apos; , added Mrs Corteen .
Until recently , he made a mockery of the sorrow he could have caused to others .
The verdict was made on the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia .
&apos;There will be a lot of beers this year &apos; , said Mrs Corteen .
However , Mr Patek can appeal to his conviction .
FAA : air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft ( but not a call with their mobile phone )
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices to read , work , play games , watch films and listen to music - but not to talk about their mobile phone - under the new , very expected new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another , declared the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta at a press conference .
The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training textbooks of crew members and the rules on the payment of equipment to be in conformity .
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft .
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&apos;depending on the plan , we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon &apos; , indicated the FAA in a statement .
At the moment , passengers have to extinguish their smartphones , tablets and other appliances as soon as the aeroplanes are closed .
They are not supposed to join them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and the commander gives the green light .
Passengers are supposed to extinguish their appliances when the plane is down before landing and not rallying it until the plane has been asked .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their appliances during take-off , landing and rolling on the ground .
Most of the new online aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi to higher altitude should meet the criteria .
Lura Glading , Chair of the Association of Protectional Fails , has been happy with these changes .
&apos;Once the new policy is implemented safely - and we are going to work closely with the hauliers for this - it will benefit everyone &apos; .
We are , frankly , tired of feeling as &apos; superseds &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet with overflowing , exchange emails and SMS or downloading data below 10 000 feet , has declared the agency .
Passengers will have to put their smartphones , tablets and other aircraft .
So , still not Words With Friends , the Scrubble online game that the Alec Baldwin player was playing on its smarphphone in 2011 when it was deported to a high noise by an American Airlines plane after refusing to extinguish its apparatus when the apparatus was kept on the door .
And the heavier appliances such as portable computers will always have to be consigned because they could hurt someone if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The regulatory power concerning mobile phones belongs to the Commission &apos;s Federal Commission and not to the FAA .
The FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing .
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Board , the National Transport Safety expert on CBS News , said that mobile phones were always considered to be a risk .
&apos;mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the FCCC , that they could disrupt the mobile phone networks if they are used on board &apos; , said Roslenker .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allows for a broader use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to relax restrictions on their use .
Critics such as Senator McCaskl , D-Mo , argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of appliances has become omnipresent .
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extinguish their devices , or do so deliberately .
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM , the high-tech gadge-tech .
New online aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA .
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi to cruise alabilities for several years .
Genetically modified aircraft to host Wi Fi systems are also better at preventing interference .
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow for a broader use of electronic devices under the new directives .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much weaker power radio transmissions than previous generations .
Electronic books readers , for example , only issue minimum transmissions when we turn a page .
But the transmissions are stronger when the equipment is downloaded or sending data .
Amazon.com is one of those who press for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , the leaders of the company had a online online plane plane , Kindle , to see if there were problems , but there was none .
This has inspired the members of the SAA Advisory Committee on the question of whether or not the use of appliances is a risk .
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers said that he thought that interference from appliances was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee have said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that appliances can interfere with aircraft systems , and that most of them are very old .
However , the committee has recommended that the FAA should allow pilots to ask passengers to extinguish their equipment during the landing to the instruments under low visibility conditions .
A group of the travel industry was pleased with the changes , calling for sensible arrangements for travellers with technology .
&apos;We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a passenger experiment is not incompatible with security &apos; , declared Roger Dow , President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association .
A Seeked bird of a North Sea platform
A bird , beleaguered after having been found on an oil platform in the North Sea , was released in nature .
The water was raised on board a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before it was handed over by the Scottish SCIP in its Valla rescue centre .
The director of the centre , Colin Seddon , said : &apos; This water water was probably a chavering migration from northern Europe and found itself caught by violent winds in the North Sea . &apos;
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform .
He added : &apos; He was unable to fly again , so we have been contacted to help . &apos;
The water water was healthy when it was released .
Is the European elite prepared to do business with Britain ?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of meeting businesses and defining what creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
In order to do this , we commissioned the widest and most comprehensive investigation from the British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , businesses and the EU .
Yanuv questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , who are generally representative of all sizes of companies , sectors and regions of Britain .
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating .
They want to see the government prioritising new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcanes .
When they ask their views on specific political points - ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws - the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key skills should go to Westminster .
The single market has caused general discontent , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area - 40 % of the large , traditionally pro-European , companies are even in agreement .
Last but not least , our survey with the entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted to see the United Kingdom continue with the initiatives to change the Treaty and to develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics .
This conclusion , which finds itself in all large groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a &apos; significant change &apos; that gives power to the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high - to change the treaty and to represent the interests of Britain better .
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that businesses hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of British companies , since the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for businesses this means placing the emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels .
The United States of Hallwees
In the United States , President Obama has not derogated from the tradition of Hallween .
Together with his wife , last night , he distributed fridges to hundreds of children invited to the White House in Washington .
Last year , Hallwelen &apos;s celebrations on the coast of the United States were cancelled because of Hurricane Sandy .
This year , the celebrations have therefore caught up .
In New York , thousands of people costutised took part in the parade organised in the &apos; Greenwiich village &apos; .
Everyone is over-excited , told one of the participants , Andrea .
I was finally able to get the costum that I planned last year .
It is like mad , adding Rahda .
People are happy .
It is a good child , it is cool .
We really need that .
Hallaween is a popular celebration celebrated on the eve of the Tousaint , mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries .
Alexi Gazprom states that Bulgaria &apos;s gas pipeline bodes a new era of gas .
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared the Director of Gazprom .
&apos;A historic event has taken place today : construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most important project in Europe &apos; , explained Alexi Miller , the Director-General of Gazprom , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine , a country by which the largest part of Russian gas for Europe passes , increases the level of risk compared with conventional routes , adds the director .
Miller added that the direct order to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are being eliminated &apos; forever &apos; .
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas from South Stream at a reduced tariff as soon as the whole project is put into operation in 2015 .
Gazprom has indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year .
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas .
The world &apos;s largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairen wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world , announced on Thursday the New Tahii newspaper , which includes information from Radio Australia .
This island , in the east of the Gambier archipelago ( French Polynesia ) , is the last United Kingdom territory in the South Pacific , half way between New Zealand and Chile .
The territory is 47 km2 , with three other small islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mammoth of the Borders , an episode of the English navy &apos;s history , which gives rise to three Hollywood adaptations .
A few tens of inhabitants , most of whom are descendants of the mutilants of the Bourest , still live Pitcaiin , and their incomes depend on 95 % of London &apos;s generosity .
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of creating a marine reserve around the small archipelago , or 836,000 km2 , which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London asking Britain to validate this request .
Mike Warren , the Mayor of Pitcin , believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for the island .
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcaiin , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would make it possible for the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2 , provided that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in Pitcaiin , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft that are dedicated to the surveillance of the area , and there is no port where there is no port of surveillance .
As for France , it must already carry out the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZs of the French Polynesia , the neighbour of Pitcaiin .
The FAA relaxed restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft - but it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones .

Life for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former Deputy Governor of the province of Jiin , in the north-east of China , was sentenced to the life prison on Friday for corruption .
As far as the Communist Party in July 2012 is concerned , Tian Xueren was accused of having affected more than 19 million youths of bribes , reporting the Chinese official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Governor , who was also the President of the Bank of Jiin , a public establishment , helped businesses and officials to obtain contracts , loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts , declared the first intermediate court in Beijing on its microphone .
President Xi Jinping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party .
If the Head of State promised that justice would also be intractable with the powerful &apos; tigers &apos; with the &apos; masses &apos; - the subservient officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted , including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing , Bo Xilai , who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office in the state .
However , the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating , for example , an independent party body .
Two YMA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord , at a hearing of the Royal Commission .
Two employees of the YICA in New Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations against the educator Caringbah , Jonathan Lord , in 2011 , at a hearing of the Royal Commission charged with child sex abuse .
However , in its opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA said that it &apos; never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organisation &apos; .
The Director-General Phillip Hare was asked about two cases : a YMCA employee was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instructor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he was working in 1991 .
Mr Hare said in Gail Furness , who was a lawyer with the Commission , that he had known the first case but was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the YMCA opening declaration was inaccurate by stressing , &apos; external controls of the YMCA have been carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organisation &apos; .
It has been demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had been given the second worst assessment of four institutions during a quality audit of the Deparate of Education and Communities carried out in August this year .
Mr Hare , who started working in the YMCA at the age of 21 , admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to check that the employees knew that they had to report any violation of child safety policy .
Earlier this year , Lord was convicted of sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years in which he worked in the YMCA .
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison .
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord &apos;s failings in the safety of children .
The staff have testified that they have observed certain shortcomings , particularly the fact that Lord remained alone with children , that he was private in private , made them sitting on his knees , told them that he loved and left them with his mobile phone .
Mr Oickwell , who was controlled by Lord and who had asked for training in the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that she was responsible for the YMCCA , Jacu Barnat , who would be a very intimidate and difficult to approach most of the time .
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these failings to their superiors .
Instead , he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have fostered their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Hare said that he had expressed his views on the YICA board of New Wales in the South saying that , for the organisation , the lesson learned from the &apos; Jonathan Lord incident &apos; was not to concern &apos; the signalling &apos; by the staff , and the Council agreed with him .
Mr Hare said that the decision to sign the staff of the confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations have been mentioned , was taken by the Director-General of the YMA , who was responsible for childcare , Liam White .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence , but that it was an &apos; excess of zeal &apos; and was badly implemented .
The YMA of New Wales was not a safe organisation for children at a time when Jonathan Lord was employed , namely between 2009 and 2011 , he declared the expert on sexual violence against children , Professor Stephen Smallstone of the University of Griffith in the Commission .
He said that there were &apos; serious problems &apos; in recruitment , control , initiation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister , but recognises that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night with the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office , the man of 59 has made his views known on various national policies .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy for the Middle East peace process .
When asked whether he would like to see the post of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have responded , according to the Evening Standard in London : &apos; Yes , of course , but it may happen , so ... &apos;
When many experts in the demonstrations in Cardiff met in Cardiff to face up and win over the Cheval of the year , they knew that competition would be ruined .
However , no one expected to see a 30-year old man .
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made its first weapons , the small and small business Shetland Tfle trotted during the three rounds with a great ease and won the first price , leaving the 30 other adults behind them .
The two inseparable - which are of the same size - were welcomed for the presentation , attitude and style in the annual contest that took place in the centre of Sunnybank , to Rudy near Cardiff .
He had a hat on the side against men and women with elegant tales , and he had his hat on the side in a way that he did not want to get rid of his 2 years old trainee .
Foreon was welcomed by the judges for the natural qualities of uncommon drawing up for a child of his age .
And Toffer has received very good notes for his presentation and personality .
Thirty in March last year , we had Tlaee in the gift of his 3rd birthday , and he has been involved with his headline Shetland every day .
His mother Donna , 30 years ago , said : &apos; Femon and Toffer are doing an excellent &apos; .
They have stood up against and against all , but both have missed the gold and rock cut .
It was only the second time that he was in Toffering and we were delighted that he won .
On the trail , people who did not know it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .
This young boy , the village of Nantyglo , near Eblow Vale , in the south of Wales , is following the footsteps of his colleague Sharon Howlls , who has been involved in disputed competitions for more than 10 years .
Mrs Howlls said : &apos; There was electricity in the air and everybody encouraged it and applauded it . &apos;
He has travelled all along the way and even if he seemed to be a little bit , he did a wonderful job .
Foreon is fou of animals - he admits horses , tractors and the rural world and has two chickens .
From the way he started , he will surely soon be taking part in the demonstration in the Sheval of the year - and I am sure he will do a good job .
A spokesperson for the annual queing event said : &apos; Foreon is only 3 years old , but he knows how to drive him . &apos;
They are a good team .
The judges have noticed that Fmenton and Thoffe were well aware of the way in which they put their names on the line .
They are looking for effective team work between the ponder and the trader - Fmenton and Toffer have been the best on the path .
I am sure that his fine clothes helped Fmenton , he was very proud .
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call &apos; will be recast &apos; .
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reshuffed , he says a press regulator .
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .
But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society .
Now the New Express is going to undergo a &apos; complete overhaul &apos; , has declared the regulator .
The order of &apos; reshuffling &apos; comes from the administration of Guangdon for Presse and Didition , Radio , Film and Television .
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express , belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group , had published a number of incorrect articles on the company listed Zoomon between September 2012 and August 2013 .
&apos;New Express was disorganized &apos; , said the regulator in a statement .
He said that he had decided &apos; to impose sanctions of an administrative nature in Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card &apos; .
He also &apos; ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete overhaul of the New Express , and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the people responsible for New Express and immediately rekindle the newspaper leadership team &apos; .
Mr Chen has written a number of articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a factory manufacturer called Zoomon .
After his arrest , his newspaper published on two occasions a call on the first page for his release , writing he supported his journalism .
But Mr Chen then appeared on a public television station where he admitted that he had published false stories against money .
&apos;In this case , I have clouded to Zoomon and to the media industry and to its ability to win public confidence &apos; , he declared the public television network CCTV .
I did so mainly because I was running after money and celebrations .
I have seen my mistake .
Following Mr Chen &apos;s apologies , New Express published his apologies on the first page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects have recently made television .
Experts say that people are systematically forced to do their best , despite a change in the law that was voted on earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to criminalise themselves .
The Charles-de Gaulle aircraft carrier in &apos; unavailability &apos;
In Toulon , the aircraft carrier is in the offing .
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two nuclear driver of Charles de Gaulle , in mid-October and when the ship was at sea , was &apos; safe for seafarers &apos; , but it is not without a consequence for the Marie .
In fact , the Royal has confirmed to us &apos; the unavailability &apos; of the vessel until &apos; mid-November &apos; , &apos; time to take the appropriate corrective measures &apos; .
For its part , the SNC , specialist in the defence naval sector , ensures that its teams and those of Areva , who are caught in the Var for the opportunity , &apos; take part in the aircraft carrier &apos; .
It is for them , among other things , to change a pump on failing heating .
&apos;Everything is being done to ensure that Charles de Gaulle can carry out his planned deployment at the end of 2013 &apos; .
And the national Marie is to certify that &apos; it does not call into question the &apos; nuclear propulsion &apos; programme .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles-de Gaulle is fate for six months .
He had operated in Toulon in mid-October for training .
This , in particular , is to describe the young pilot pilots .
A &apos; small chy &apos; , circumscribed in the reactor &apos;s area of containment , then occurred on the flagship ship of the French fleet .
According to the national Marie , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a great deal of displeasure from the people I meet : a monstrous revaluation of their properties , a flood of taxes , the cost of permits of all kinds , and administrative costs .
In short , there is no limit on our pockets .
Millions of dollar-denominated dollars could be saved in order to allow much respectful taxation of those who pay .
Any money that is being taken out of force by taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment .
In Shawinigan , despite the closure of all major companies , there is no problem with the somptuary expenditure and the maintenance of lame ducks : a deficit centre , a strong subsidy to the Energy City and so on .
If these facilities are not profitable , they are sold to private enterprise or demobilized .
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come .
However , I would like to make an honourable reference to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator , but at what cost for tax payers ?
It is not for public pavers to invest in such companies , but for the private sector based on consumer demand .
The citizens were pleased to learn that the lakes in Fisheries and Picles will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
Following the departure of all the industries ( major water consumption ) and the large decline in the population , the use of water has fallen considerably throughout the territory .
Without wishing to waste it , the city will never lack water and the strict regulation on its use could be greatly adulterated .
In short , it is very easy to achieve a great deal with other money .
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance .
With a gross debt of more than USD 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a borrowing regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years by encounties with fine degrees for most , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse .
Open a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railways
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting systems , ventilation and electric rails , was discovered .
The US authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages that they had ever seen .
The tunnel , zigzagant on an equivalent length of six long football grounds , links warehouses near Tijana , Mexico , San Diego , the United States .
The area is full of intractable warehouses , which makes it easy to hide the heavy goods vehicles .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it indiscriminately .
The authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered , according to judicial cases .
Three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers , were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine .
They run a prison sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted .
In Noval , Arizona , the smugglers exploit vast underground channels .
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the harvesting of marijuana in the centre of Mexico in October , posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 yards fitted with flanking routes from the kitchen of a Tijana house and went up to two warehouses of San Diego .
The British police
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange , who took refuge in the Ecuador Embassy in London and called for political asylum .
Scotland Yard said that she had issued a &apos; demarcation opinion &apos; against the Australian of 40 years , asking him to present himself to a police officer , saying that if he did not , he would be able to be arrested .
Assange could be extradited in Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime , having exhausted every possible avenue under British law after the Supreme Court has invalidated the call that he made against his extradition at the beginning of the month .
Bearing in mind that Stockholm allows its transfer to the United States , it found refuge in the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June calling on this country of South America to asylum .
Scotland Yard has &apos; issued an opinion against a 40-year-old man who asks him to present himself to a police officer , on the date and time of his choice &apos; , he said a spokesperson .
It continues to violate the conditions for its release .
The Ambassador has refused to comment on the issuing of the opinion by the police .
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of spying , after unveiling more than 250 000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site combating secret information .
How will biometrics invade our lives
Are the words &apos; to tap &apos; to get access to its martphon or pay for it ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by the biometric capture of phones and computers .
Bernard Didier , the Deputy Director-General of Morpho , even believes that &apos; the century will be biometric &apos; .
Only biometrics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe and transnational universe .
Organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics , but are concerned about it .
In 2011 and France alone , the National Commission for IT and Freedoms authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the form of the hand or the veil network of hand in companies , administrations and canteens ...
&apos;Everyone will soon be able to be identified , anywhere and anywhere &apos; , to be moved to Washington , which is the responsibility of the private life of consumers in the CDT and Technology .
The reasons for such optimism , for some , and for pessimism , among others ?
biometrics will be based on new techniques , which will enable new services to be made available to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are fingerprints , the hand of hand and the veil network of pam or fingers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;For example , some people who work the concrete have a very abysmal fingers and their fingerprints are illegible &apos; , as Philippe Robin , the technical director of the identity field in Thales and Security .
The collection and verification of the veil network and the hand of the hand mean a voluntary and specific gesture of people .
It is both a security and one that cannot be taken into account in their inputs - and one drawback - the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time .
As a result , research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches , such as the recognition of the face or the ice ( the colorated part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the captors and the ability to calculate the computers required for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The precision of facile recognition has been multiplied by ten in the last five years , calming Cyrile Batller , Director of R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or iris on the move .
&apos;Today , we are carrying out research into the recognition of the voice or the way to walk with the help of sound caps , but we need a silent environment &apos; , which indicates Sridhar Iyengar , the Director of Security Research to Intel Labs .
A single and indefensible Marquor , DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
&apos;In the current state of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirms Sophie Vullit-Toudenial , Director of Studies , Innovation and Outlook to CNIL .
But the DNA analysis is still very long and costly .
NEPC proposes a value of EUR 90,000 for the judicial police services to analyse samples of DNA in the place of a crime and in an hour .
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups : identification ( recognition of one person among others ) and authentication ( to ensure that the person is the one it claims to be ) .
The identification concerned the issuing of identity papers so far : the biometrics ( fingerprints , photograph , iris ) have to be confronted with the information that the state has on all the citizens who have already been frozen .
This makes it possible to ensure that someone is not trying to usurp someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison may have other applications .
NEPC is therefore proposing the recognition of VIII for a hotel or a shop .
&apos;We reject the images of surveillance cameras and compare them to the photographs of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet &apos; , explaining Dany Nassif , who is responsible , at home France , for trade development for biometric identification solutions .
Another use : taking into photograph a quid pro quo in a shop , following his progress through facial recognition and calculate waiting times .
Reauthentification initially concerned physical access ( borders , protected local , canteens ... ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
Then , more recently , there was control .
&apos;A biometric light avoids the Coptic phenomenon that is leading for another &apos; justifies Cyrile Batller , Accountability .
More and more , however , authentication will also apply to transactions , especially those made from connected devices to the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and putting its hand on a biometric reader : this gesture replaces the strike of the secret code .
A similar technique is being tested in Villenuve-d &apos;Ascq and Androme by the Natural-Security company in partnership with the big distribution banks and teachers : when it comes to paying in shops with its banking card , the customer does not tap his code , but introduces his finger in a reader who scanns the calves .
The experiment is planned for six months .
If it is conclusive , biometric readers may soon come to the French traders .
Solutions to reassure users
There are three ways of making biometrics attractive to the general public .
The first is to explain that it can save time .
&apos;If , thanks to biometrics , a customer is still in charge of 30 seconds less , that is a good thing &apos; , the director of a large area will be explained .
The second is to provide personalised services : in a few years &apos; time a voting server will be able to recognise your voice and propose options .
Last but not least , I should like to reassure them by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;fingerprints are stored on a first server ; people &apos;s identities are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure boy , which is blocked if attempts are made to move it &apos; , lists Philippe Robin Robin , Thales .
But , because of a lack of thorough studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
Experts on the protection of privacy continue to worry .
&apos;The progress of facile recognition , the multiplication of the surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photographs available on Facebook , Flickr or Picasta , make me fear the worst : generalised surveillance &apos; , predicting Andrew Patrick , the Commissioner for the Protection of Privacy in Canada .
A driver running at 210 km / h with a hot drink between the legs has been given a ammunition of GBP 1 000 .
A car driver had a fine of GBP 1 000 for a 210 km / h , with a hot drink that was put in balance between his legs .
Andrew Howa , 35 years ago , from Tipene in Essex , was returned to his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Baintree on 27 May .
When the police stopped it , they discovered the drink to be taken between its legs .
In the Court of First Instance in the Court of First Instance , HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHA admitted to the infringement of conduct without the necessary caution and attention .
The seven points that have been withdrawn on its permit have led to a six-month withdrawal of licences .
HHHHHHHHHA has also been condemned to pay costs amounting to Â£ 90 and a surcharge for a Â£ 100 .
Foreign property tax in order to burst the London bubble
The Treasury has temporarily quantified the measure of tax on capital gains but is waiting for a final decision by Mr Osborne , who , in the 2012 budget , has placed a 7 % right of stamps for the properties of more than 2 MP and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a society rather than individually .
The right of stamps already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea , and accounts for 708 M in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , Northwest and the Yorkshire and Humber .
Mr Cook said : &apos; As a result of the increase in the right of stamps on high value properties and the introduction of the Anti-Fraud Act in this area , it is very difficult to argue that the value of great value is underimposed independently of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &apos;
&apos;But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the existing owners who are reluctant to sell &apos; .
Sovereign housing - the 55-10 % of the highest prices in the housing market - in the prosperous sector in the south-west of London , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbedon , rose by a record percentage of 11.8 % over the last year .
Prices in the centre of London show regular growth of 5.6 % year on year , but have been overshadowed by a growing &apos; internal market &apos; , the south-west of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) and is ( 6.5 % ) with a recovery , according to Savilles &apos;s studies .
Scientists have just highlighted how the queue of a dog &apos;s queue is linked to its mood .
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs were moving more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs were more to the left .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them .
Professor Georgio Vallortica , a neuroscience of the University of Trente , said : &apos; Everyone knows that , in man , the left side and the right of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions . &apos;
Here we have tried to see what happened in other species .
He said that , as well as men , in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and that both hemisphere played a different role in emotions .
In order to know more about how dogs react to the disorderly movements of other dogs , researchers have followed animals watching films where there were other dogs .
They have measured the heart incidence of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their queues sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor Vallortigara explained : &apos; We have submitted to dogs where there were other dogs - either an naturalist version or a silt to avoid any further confusion - and we have been able to traffic in the queue and present it to the left or the right . &apos;
When the animals saw a dog without an expression of the queue to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that was queuing up ) , they remained perfectly detached .
But when they got back a queue mainly to the left ( once again from the point of view of the dog that was queuing up ) , their heart frequency accelerated and they were anxious .
Professor Vallortica said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating between them with these movements .
Rather , it believes that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet on a number of occasions other dogs , and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their queues on one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude , you will react to that experience . &apos;
Researchers indicate that the results could enable owners , vets and addicts to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The expert expert John Bradshaw , a professor invited to the University of Bristol University , said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the canine species .
Last year , a team from the University of Lincoln found that the dogs were going to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and on the right when it was a jewel dog .
And in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada , he said : &apos; Doctors go more easily to a robust dog when his queue wins to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study . &apos;
He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs involved in the various studies did not fully consider the animals or robot dogs like dogs .
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
&apos;Although many of the elements , raised in various mammals , indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception , he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not be long before we understand why their queues sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other .
Artic Monkeys is a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner &apos;s disease
The rock group Artic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after a lord has been diagnosed to his sister .
The group of Sheffield was to take place on Friday in the Hydroo Chamber in the centre .
However , his lynch has forced the singer Alex Turner to replan the spectacle .
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to GG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .
In a statement on their official site , Artic Monkeys said : &apos; Following the decision to postpone the concert to GG Arena in Birmingham this evening and after asking for a medical opinion , the Artic Monkeys must also postpone the spectacle to the Gyro de Glasgow on Friday , 1 November . &apos;
&apos;Alex Turner is suffering from a lynch and regrets that he cannot be allowed to happen in concert . &apos;
The spectacle to GG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and that in Glasgow on 21 November .
All the tickets remain valid for these concerts .
We wish to apologise to all the ticket holders for all the disapproval .
Thank you for contacting the customer service to the bet where you bought your tickets for any additional assistance .
Pope FranÃ§ois will name his first cardinals in February
Pope FranÃ§ois will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , announced the Vatican on Thursday .
Cardinals are the men of the highest in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect it , so FranÃ§ois will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor .
There is now 201 cardinals .
However , as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80 , it can no longer take part in the election of a Pope , so it is a group of 120 &apos; cardinals &apos; .
In a statement announcing the news , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all the existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony in which bishops will be high on the dignity of Cardinal , known as a conscientious .
&apos;Pope FranÃ§ois has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February conisse in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of the cardinals in different parts of the world &apos; , said Lombardi .
Jack Valalo of the Catholics has said that by February , the number of voters will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinals as he needed to ensure that the number of cardinals reached 120 and so many cardinals aged over 80 years ago that he wanted .
The conscientious next year will be important , because it will be the first since the election of Pope FranÃ§ois in March of this year , said Valero .
At the moment , there is a kind of trend towards Europe and in particular Italy .
&apos;It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will name cardinals in the rest of the world to restore balance &apos; , he added .
40 % of Roman Catholics live in South America , but a small number of cardinals represent them .
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since FranÃ§ois formed the Council of Cardinals , a group of eight cardinals all over the world charged with examining ways of reforming the church .
Previously , the Pope decided alone .
&apos;From now on , FranÃ§ois has chosen these eight cardinals to help him &apos; , he has explained Valero .
He added that he was &apos; entirely possible &apos; that FranÃ§ois is asking for the cardinals .
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is completely new .
Valero pointed out that the popes were usually bishops representing large communities as cardinal , but that FranÃ§ois was &apos; full of surprises , so we do not know who he will name &apos; .
GM recalls some of its new pickers in the United States
General Motors Co recalls almost 19 000 of all the new pickles Shevroland Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 in order to deal with a problem with the dossiers that are invariably written , according to a statement on Friday of the American body responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some pickps , the seats before could present a defect at the mechanism of the mechanism .
As a result , cases do not meet the federal safety standards for vehicles with regard to e-the-counter .
&apos;If the vehicle is lost by the back door , it may be that e-heads do not adequately protect passengers , thus increasing the risk of injuries &apos; , according to the statement on the site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) .
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of GM pickps began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009 .
GM informed the owners of the default in the first half of October .
The NHTSA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16 days judgment of government activities , which slowed down the growth of vehicle sales in October .
The sales of pickups and Sierra Leone , which were redrawn for the 2014 model , rose by around 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , declared GM on Friday .
In October , GM sold 42 660 pickps Silverado and 16 503 pickps .
The price of GM actions rose by 1.4 % to USD 37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .
A worker dies
A construction worker has died in dozens of concrete blocks , on Thursday , the day before 12 , in Montreal .
The tragedy took place at 11 a.m. on the Marquette street , close to the intersection of the Beauwell street , in the round-off of Rosemont-La Petite Patrie .
In all likelihood , there has been work on the foundations in this place for some time .
There has been a flimsy wall of foundation in the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had come to the site to recover his tools .
I was in car and I saw the wall crumbling with a great smoke cloud , said Sylvain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I am landed and I went to remove the big bricks that recovered .
It was only part of his back , that is so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in the fifties who worked for a coffer company .
Religious manoeuvres have been tempted by emergency services , but without success .
man has not survived his serious injuries .
An inspector of the Commission for Health and Security of Work has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
The cry of desperation by a constituent of Obama
I voted twice in favour of President Obama .
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts with the obstruction of the Republican Party
obstructionism
The memory of Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened .
Naathiel P. Morris is studying in 2nd year medicine to Harvard &apos;s Faculty Medicine .
I am reading an extremely sad book these days .
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the ingenuity of the 2th year of medicine and would give me hope .
He is called &apos; The Autonomy to Win &apos; , and it is the memoirs of Barack Obama &apos;s presidential campaign in 2008 .
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening , and I am speaking , this book won me at the time when politicians were inspired by millions of people and speeches could cut you off .
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and prestigious news prestiors took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment .
My comrades were happy and my parents kept all the newspapers that they found .
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition period before he took office in 2008 , he had 82 % in favour .
Then I am closing the book .
The return to the present is a difficult awakening , it is like getting out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism , it is like distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change has really occurred in the years after which I voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put great achievements on the credit of Obama , from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army , to the end of the &apos; neither seen nor known &apos; and the murder of Osama bin Laden .
Furthermore , I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of GuantÃ¡namo , among other things .
But , having repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and my colleagues , I can no longer explain .
I am on the verge of political despair .
The Republican obstruction cannot explain foreign leaders , or the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans , or the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the misdeeds of the government .
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , without trial , and the avoidance of public funding and the overshooting of permitted expenditure during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the &apos; most aggressive ... since Nixon &apos;s administration &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified .
I do not know whether that is what I expected .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it .
Obviously , the electoral function is not foreseeable , because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance , such as the Newton massacre , are influencing our public conversation .
However , all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what annoys me most .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed not to be able to determine his policies or positions .
I knew that Obama , who was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections , would make the promises that we have been hearing about for so long .
Yet , while the favourable opinion index plunged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I welcome the many promises that have been made .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses in the profits of Clinton to the Primayors of Pennsylvania .
At a post-campaign meeting he told his team that they had to get back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause .
&apos;I want us to focus on our talent &apos; .
We must remember who we are .
We are five years after , Mr President , and I do not agree with you any more .
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Naathiel Morris .
On Friday , at 3 p.m. , a violent collision between a moto and a car took place in Retinne in FlÃ©lon .
The late , Jonathan , 26 years of FlÃ©lon , was not a whistle .
Despite rapid relief , he died at this frontal collision .
Clive Palmer says that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system .
The billionaire Member Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system .
The extraction of mining , which contests the payment of a carbon tax of USD 6 , has made this argument to try to remove questions about a possible conflict .
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Abbott &apos;s daughters were prepared to benefit personally from these policies .
&apos;He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying off parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave &apos; , he said Mr Palmer .
Two months after his election , the Electoral Commission officially stated that Mr Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Faifax by 53 votes , after recounting .
Mr Palmer has put forward the idea of a reshuffling of the voting system to speed up the process .
The daughters of Tony Abbott , Francis and Bridgy .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over ?
&apos;We need a better system &apos; , he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , take your coordinated action in a computer , vote immediately and get the result at 6.30 p.m. the next morning ?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper pens to mark the ballot papers .
Is it to be able to erase the result if anyone is not in agreement ?
Nowadays , having a paper paper seems extraordinary .
The Electoral Commission has studied the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand .
Mr Palmer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new role &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service .
&apos;We are not looking for reward , except for the reward for history , because we must serve the community at a critical moment &apos; , he added .
A team of biologists headed by the Wildlife Corporation Society in New York has identified a new species of dolphin on the northern coast of Australia .
Thibaux Bucoux , charged with scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for the Conservation and Aquitude of Aniills and Milocations Marins ( OCEMMM ) is for the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Is the discovery of this new species of dolphin ?
This is good news , but it does not surprise me particularly .
If , in the past , species have been described and identified on a morphological , anatomic and geographical basis , today the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in science of the classification of species .
It is not possible , moreover , that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a type of species , a family or even an order .
At the beginning of the 19th century , morphologists classified animals , based on morphological differences between species .
Today , some of these rankings are called into question because of genetic progress .
Similarly , two species that are very close to morphologically have been distinguished by genetic engineering .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
Ten years ago , the scientific community recognized two species belonging to that sub-family : dolphins in the Pacific and the Atlantic whales .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is it an important discovery , as the Wildlife Corporation Society said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability .
Had this population been known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only in that place .
Therefore , if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental catch arises in the region , we may have to deal with the extinction of a species , rather than the local disappearance of a population of a more widely spread species on earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered according to the number of existing people on earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it has to recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to the Sousa chunk , whose population of the new species discovered is out , its stock has automatically become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals ?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homogenous , open habitats , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This brevity of genes limits the creation of new species .
Conversely , more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which can eventually create new species .
We must be aware that the marine environment is the least well known .
We prefer to send robots to Mars , to know what is living in the graves of Mariannes , only 11 kilometres from the sea area .
More money is spent on research into other planets than on marine research and it is high time that this changed .
RBS suspended two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two trainees from its exchange of exchange markets according to two sources close to the dossier , which shows once again that the global investigation of regulators on suspicion of manipulation of the currency market is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the largest banks in the world , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world &apos;s most important financial market investigations , where USD 5.3 trillion is changing every day .
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation which echoes the scandal of the manipulation of the interbank rate .
The bank , which refused to comment on the suspensions , confirmed this month received requests for information from regulators .
&apos;The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCF and the other regulators &apos; , declared a bank representative two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the dossier have stated that RBS had passed on e-mails and instant messages , sent to and by a former trader , to the British regulator , the Financial Conditions Authority .
This trader , Richard Usher , left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from the post of European Trading Trading officer in JPMorgan .
Rohan Rachandani , a European company responsible for the exchange of foreign exchange in Citi , was put on holiday this week , while Matt Garder , a trader of currency in Barclays and UBS , was suspended by Standard Chartered this week .
None of these traders have been charged .
Mr Usher &apos;s dossier included instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup , who added to the issue .
UBS explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Finma , said that he was investigating suspicions of manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities - the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FF , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - look at the allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate rates on the exchange market .
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from regulators , have indicated sources that are close to the case .
The banks have plagued instant messages and emails for years to find cases of reprehensible acts .
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banks in recent years , but which has been questioned this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast liquid currency market , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A golden trader has said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use of banks in their own internal platforms &apos; explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost &apos; .
The news came on the same day that the CretÃ© Switzerland announced that it had sent a trader to its office of funds negotiated on the London stock exchange this week after it caused a loss of USD 6 million at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators .
&apos;We are convinced that the trader has acted on its own and that the case has been controlled &apos; , has indicated a representative of the Swiss Case .
The investigation of Mayor Rob
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford flowing from the crick , Me Clayton Ruby supported that he had never seen such a botched investigation .
Me Ruby said in the Presse Canadians that the police had &apos; ignored or minimized &apos; evidence against the mayor .
On Thursday , the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of Rob Ford , Alexander Lisi , aged 35 , and accused him of extortion on video .
Alexander Lisi , who was previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the mayor .
The police have said that they have also observed that man issuing the parcel to Rob Ford , indicating new court documents .
Me Ruby called it &apos; inexplicable &apos; the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford &apos;s vehicle or his home , or on listening to his phone , arguing that the police leader Bill Blair has chosen to do nothing against the mayor .
Under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands , could very well have intercepted Rob Ford &apos;s vehicle , arrested the mayor , and carry out a search - even without a mandate .
It could also have demanded an instant search mandate , if deemed necessary .
The Head of Police has not commented , but his spokesman Mark Pugouh has described the words of Me Ruby as &apos; obvious and desperate attempt &apos; to press for the media in a case that is not in any way relevant .
At the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &apos; reasonable motives &apos; that could lead to a criminal accusation against the mayor .
European stock markets
With the exception of London , the major European stock markets are falling on Friday at midnight , overshadowed by some of the new disappointing companies , while Welsh is expected to rise .
On the other hand , investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could set up its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
Conversely , after an inflation rate of 0.7 % for the euro area as a whole , the idea is spread among the market players that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could relax its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street suggests that there will be an increase in US actions , after two consecutive sessions .
To the values , Renault ( 4.63 % ) recorded the strongest retreat from CAC 40 , which was overshadowed by the warning about the outcome of its Nissan Motor Friday partner .
Royal Bank of Scotland ( -6.26 % ) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300 , having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a structure of defiance ( &apos; baad bank &apos; ) involving GBP 38 billion of the most risky assets .
For its part , Vodafe ( + 2.45 % ) is still in the forefront of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that TT is to study a possible takeover bid .
On the exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the ECB &apos;s monetary policy is going well , as John Hardy testifies to in Saxo Bank .
The ECB &apos;s single mandate has always focused on inflation , so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
We are anticipating a great potential for a reduction in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its retreat against the US currency and has hit a lower than two weeks at USD 1.3517 .
The same conjecture is in contrast to the euro area bond market .
The Supreme Court validates Obama &apos;s health-care reform
A great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court has said today that the reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional .
By 5 votes against 4 , the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( law on the protection of patients and affordable care ) - which requires citizens to sign up to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they will have to pay a fine - and have said that it is constitutional under the government &apos;s power of taxation .
The President of the Supreme Court , John Roberts , joined the four most liberal members of the Court , while judges Sclia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement .
The Court has also validated the other sections of the 2 700 pages law and has , moreover , considered that the provision of the health system reform law , which states that the eligibility threshold should be lowered to Medicaid , should be coercive in accordance with the constitution , if it is not to lose all federal funding .
The procedure for blocking the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Investment .
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the first place in 2012 , including the candidate Mitt Romney , were fiercely opposed to the law .
Congratulations to the former combatants in Manon
At the heart of the cemetery of the Tramuquet , civil , religious and military authorities , as well as many patriotic associations , have made a tribute to the soldiers and deputies of all wars on Friday afternoon .
Blocks have been lodged in two of the three military masters of the cemetery by the mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities .
Agreement between Palestinians and Israelis on Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on Thursday 31 October 2013 in a violent cup on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday , 1 November after the depletion of its fuel stocks , announced the Energy Authority of the Palestinian enclave .
A local commander of the Brigades Azzediine Alassam , Khaled Abu Bakr , and another framework of the armed arm of Hamas , Rabieh Barikeh , were killed by a shells of shells during an incursion by the Israeli army to the east of Khan YounÃ¨s , in the south of Gaza , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials in the Al-Qassam Brigades , Mohammed al-Qasas and Mohammed Daoud , died when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four combatants were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel .
A Tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli cat and a blank bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred metres inside the territory and then withdrew .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communiquÃ© , a Hamas spokesman , Sami Abu Zouhari , paid tribute to the four &apos; heroes &apos; and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died in confrontation .
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory in an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan YounÃ¨s .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier &apos; , threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army has indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a broad tunnel that has been increasing in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave , discovered on 7 October and , according to the army , intended for &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel , stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers in order to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communiquÃ© .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive enslavement aimed at the forces of TSahal ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israel in northern Syria
&apos;This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians &apos; , and the spokesperson for the Peter Lerner has also said that .
On the other hand , Israel has hit an air military base in north-west Syria , aimed at a cargo of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement , which reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellite station .
A US official has confirmed an &apos; Israeli strike &apos; but has not given details of the target .
&apos;In the past , the targets were missiles transferred to Hizbollah &apos; , and it was simply added .
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
These are the &apos; exclusive sources &apos; that it has not named , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that &apos; the bombing targeted a cargo of air missiles that was intended for Hizbollah in Lebanon &apos; , referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .
Earlier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Human Rights Observatory , reported several explosions on Wednesday at the dawn in an air defence base at Sonar JabÃ© , near Lattacked , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation based on a network of medical activists and sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions .
The black and white for Marie Chouinard , who is presenting to Dane Danse his two new hordes of group : the first inspired of Henri Micheu &apos;s encounters and poems , the second inflated by the famous soano Gymnsees of SEM .
One evening that makes it possible to see the whole prism of Chouinard , art and black paper in white .
A white screen serves as a wall of substance .
On the table , as white as it is , in the huge space that is the Theislike Maibell , in advance , of profile , an end like a black line and clothing , a body .
On the screen , a ink of Henri Michel is planned .
The body , simple , takes its form .
And this form will be the whole coin : a string of physical imitation of designs .
The dangers , which are completely dressed in black , only their hands and face face , are waiting on each side of the game , rushing when the next geography appears , incarcerating it , getting out of hand .
The black and white game of Henri Micheau is being made up of solos , in a group in unison ( a mass that is wreaking ) , a large group of twelve solos where everyone is performing his sign .
We are thinking of &apos; Glory morning &apos; , where , in solo , Chouinard carried out a series of written colleges on cartels , which are online .
This is the same principle , a giant PowerPoint version .
Here music is strong , permeated and electrical .
Energy is high , the pace is always fast .
There will be a cap when Carol Prior takes refuge under the dancing carpet , to hand over , microphone , without sobriety or restraint , one part of Michell &apos;s poem , monocrorde and monotone , and will continue with dancing .
And music to restart , and the sequence to resume .
This sound and energetic discharge , which is long , if that may be the case , will end up overwhelmed and engulfed .
As is also the case with the regularity of the visual pace .
There are some fine fashs - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those hair who scrap or these black tissues , which extend the lines .
But the chorus approach is lacking .
You have the impression that the chorus , instead of going to the Michelle works , has been imposed , with its ticks .
As a result , the bodies seem to be at pains .
Michell &apos;s carcasses , like the forms of Gestalt , open up a broader and gas-guzzling imaginary than dancing .
Only the end , in negative terms , with its dancing drowned by a stranglehold light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre , affects magic .
The public was very pleased , the welcome was warm .
The Gymnis , after the event , is richer .
The scene is partly bred , danters and piano are covered of tissue , like furniture in a abandoned house .
In the piano , danters were going to play their part .
Their misaddresses in music , touching , give real fragility .
On the scene , we pass couples , who are lovely , very sensory , even erotic .
Working group , small slos of transitions , sets out that is moving , shocking , writing is less binary .
There are breath , so familiar with Chouinard , with the red nose , with very polarized men and women .
The amateurs are carnasers , futures or players .
gestures , laughs and small cries transmit the archaic , the grace and the ridiculous of the bodies in the cool , of the people who are founded .
But the coin takes its real flight after salvation .
A clown is on the scene when the public leaves .
Here , everything is allowed to happen : the fourth wall falls , the explored universe is supervised , the drunk danters are being descended among spectators , glossing , fudging , fudging , playing a covenant , playing a covenant , and a miscalculated mess that remains senseless .
joy and madness transpires , and it is the art of Chouinard , there , to contaminate the public .
Google , Samsung and Huawei
The group which has thousands of former Nortel patents has started an avalanche of legal proceedings on patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers , in particular Google , the company that he hastened to the pole at the auctioning of patents that took place after Nortel bankruptcy .
Rokstor , the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for USD 4.5 , has lodged a complaint against Samsung Electronic Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei and four other companies for a patent breach of the United States .
Rokstor is held jointly by Apple , Microsoft , Blackberry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused of violating seven patents .
Patents contain technologies that make it possible for advertising to be advertised on the Internet , have indicated the conclusions of the trial , which is the heart of Google .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rokstor .
Samsung , Huawei and HTC are producing telephones operating under the Angolan operating system , which pits fierce competition on Apple and Microsoft mobile products .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of USD 900 for Nortel patents .
Google has increased its offer several times , finally proposing $ 4.4 .
After losing the Nortel patents in the face of Rokstor , Google won Motorola Mobility for a sum of USD 12.5 , a market in part based on Motorola &apos;s patents .
&apos;Even though it has failed in its attempt to acquire patents at auction , Google has violated and continues to violate these patents &apos; , indicated the conclusions of the trial .
Rokstor calls for greater damage and interest against Google , because he claims that the violation of Google patents is stubborn , according to the complainant .
Explosion of a house in Gesves : a defective water
The grandmother had a cigarette in a gas leak .
The explosion of a housing in Gesves , which made two serious injuries on Friday morning , a grandmother of 52 years and his grandson of five years , was due to a gas flight from a defective driver , indicated Friday evening the substitute for the Roi prosecutor .
The expert from the public prosecutor &apos;s office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental .
The grandmother sounded a cigarette when there was a flight and an accumulation of gas .
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still committed .
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is being burnt down .
The little boy , who was resident in his grandfather and his companion , was on his side and was burned slightly .
&apos;The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the ground before being taken in the LiÃ¨ge of LiÃ¨ge , it helicopter , it was ambulance &apos; , made the quagmire JosÃ© Paulet , descending on the scene .
The grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
Seen and except , he was able to join the seamed by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed .
The grandfather and the tenor of the neighbouring house , which has been weakened by the explosion , have been relaxed by the President of the CPAS .
The fire brigades in Andran and Namur and the police of the Arches have intervened .
The civil protection of Crisger has stabilised both buildings .
Egypt \ u0027s freely elected President
Mohamed Morsi lent the investiture of investiture , but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt .
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a &apos; new Egypt &apos; when he preached the presidency of the presidency , thus becoming the first freely elected President and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was hunted out of power 16 months earlier .
In his investiture before the Constitutional Court , Mr Morsi has also become the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago .
He lent to the Court &apos;s 18 black judge judges whose building on the Nile was built to look like an Egyptian temple .
&apos;We want a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic &apos; , said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast on public television .
&apos;Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom , true democracy and stability &apos; , explained Mr Morsi , a 60 year old engineer trained in the United States , from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been considered to be an illegal and hard-pressed organisation by successive governments for over 84 years .
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours , a local hour , followed by a small convoy .
Only a few hundred fans had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and , demarcation of the presidential agenda of the Mubarak years , traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoys to the very frequent streets linking the centre-city to the southern suburbs .
In view of the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood has been a little charismatic , its personal prestige has increased considerably since its victory and Friday &apos;s speech in which it tried to present itself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak .
&apos;Egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional and modern state &apos; , said Mohamed Morsi , in blue suits and red swaps , to the judges present in the boy room in which he was sworn .
Later , Mr Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his inauguration speech .
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare that played the national anthem when he was on the doorstep .
The Maurechal Hussein Tantai attended the ceremony .
When he arrived , he was hosted by the words &apos; the people and the army , hand in hand &apos; .
In 1908 and a former bastion of secular education , the University of Cairo became a fiefer of Islamic students &apos; groups in the 1970s .
Mr Morsi made a symbolic sertion on the Tahrir Square on Friday , hence the uprising that ended Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian regime last year , and he tried to recover the presidential powers of which the military council , which replaced the former President , defied him .
However , by agreeing to formally close before the Court , rather than before Parliament as it is used , it is nearing the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over .
Mr Morsi &apos;s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures .
The Hutdown in the United States
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October , showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers , five of the main six of which performed below expectations .
The three large Detroit manufacturers have double-digit growth compared with October 2012 , but only General Motors has done better than expected .
Analysts had an average of 15.4 million sales at an annualized rate and corrected seasonal variations , but the market was set at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas , an analyst of Morgan Stanley .
In a note to the clients of the bank , he believes that this slight brake is due primarily to &apos; the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month &apos; .
However , GM reported a rise of almost 16 % of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles , compared with 211 563 expected by the consensus .
The four brands of the group have seen their trade performance improve compared to October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit , among other things , from the success of its pick-ups , has seen its sales grow by 14 % over one year to 191 985 vehicles , while the consensus was 194 301 .
For its part , Chrysler , controlled by Fiat , announced a 11 % increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles , compared with 143 536 .
Toyota and Nissan also show lower sales of the consensus , despite increases in one year of 8.8 % and 14.2 % respectively .
On the New York Stock Exchange , GM action was 1.4 % at 16.35 GMT , while Ford gave up 1.1 % .
Renault
Renault accuses the largest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris on Friday , after its Nissan Motor partner has announced that its annual net benefit forecast has fallen by almost 20 % .
Nissan , which had to carry out such a review , also announced a reshuffling of its direction .
Several traders have reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by &apos; learning &apos; .
&apos;It is clearly the learning gain of Nissan &apos; , which is a person responsible for the trading of an Paris courtyard .
As part of the Renault Nissan Alliance , Renault holds 43.4 % of Nissan &apos;s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of the French , according to the Nissan website data .
Greece : two deaths in a shooting near a local neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed , and another was seriously injured on Friday evening by shooting by two people who were on board a moto who was going to a local neo-Nazi Abe party in the western suburbs of Athens , was taught from the police .
The police were not able to give information about the identity of victims and their possible political affiliation .
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden DawÃ© had argued that the victims were local guards .
The injured person was immediately hospitalised , depending on the same source .
The police officers of the anti-terrorist service have been descended on the central avenue of the suburb No Iraqi , where the incident took place and closed the area .
The incident takes place a few weeks after the indictment of six Members from Golden Dawn , whose party leader and founder , to participate in &apos; a criminal organisation &apos; in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members .
Scot Brown
Scot Brown , the Captain of Celtic Glasgow , has seen his rejected appeal and will be suspended for the next two matches of his club , against Ajax and AC Milan .
Expelled against Barthat for a coup d &apos;Ã©tat , the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA .
In a communiquÃ© , his club said &apos; very disappointed &apos; , believing that his appeal was entirely justified .
Nearly 50 000 households are deprived of electricity on the whole province , shortly after midday on Friday , due to the violent winds affecting many regions along the St Laurent River .
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15 042 subscribers plunged into the black , Montengoverned with 13 464 and the Outaese with 8642 .
The large Montreal region also has a lot of panels with almost 7000 private households in the metropolla and Laval .
You thought that the travel agents were in the past because of the Internet ?
Fine Centre seems to reverse the trend .
Society has revised its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results thanks to the holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying profit on the whole exercise between USD 325 and 340 before taxes , against a previous forecast of USD 305 to 315 M .
If current forecasts are met , it will represent 12 to 17 % of growth compared with the record benefit of USD 290.4 in 2011 / 12 .
The Director General , Graham Turner , said that Flight Centre had made 8 % of the profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly as regards travel other than business trips in Australia and the United Kingdom .
&apos;Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are on the right track to achieve record results on the whole exercise before deducting interest and taxes &apos; , he said .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits .
In Australia , the recreational travel sector has been rekindled during the second half of the year , which made it possible to compensate for a small domestic market in business trips .
Similarly , in the United Kingdom , the Fliht-Centre leisure sector has performed well , while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States has recovered its losses during the first half of the year in which seasonal demand is lower and should benefit the whole exercise for the third time in a row .
The actions of Fairt Centre have increased by 3 cents to USD 38.20 yesterday .
Innovations are on a hotel near the Cairo pyramid .
Innovative inmates opened the fire this Friday on a hotel close to the Cairo pyramid in Egypt without any victims , as a result of an apparent dispute with redundant workers .
The murderers took the flight , said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , the police General Abdel L. .
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has almost no tourist ever since the army deposed the Islamic President Mohamed Morsi at the beginning of July and represses the protests of his supporters .
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics , spelling and grammar grammar .
In the course of the English literature courses , pupils will have to study at least a piece of Shakespeare , a nineteenth-century novel , a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction of 1914 .
The review will also present &apos; new texts &apos; to encourage a more diverse reading .
A combination of literature and English language will be removed .
From 2015 , pupils will have to pass an independent GCSE , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education must publish its new programmes in English and mathes tomorrow - the first materials to undergo radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , Ofqual , the regulator of the examinations , will disclose a overhaul of the GCC structure , with a new rating system and less course .
Speaking in the summer , Michael Gove , Minister of Education , said that there was a &apos; broad consensus on the need to reform our examinations to restore public confidence &apos; , insisting that the GCC would be &apos; more stimulating , more ambitious and more rigorous &apos; .
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths ( 116 hours per year , or 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
In comparison , the Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year , and the Singapore pupils make about 138 hours .
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the use of time to mathes , the sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCA of deep mathies - as well as the greater importance given to matters in international rankings - would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours .
The programme will put more emphasis on &apos; real world problems &apos; , including financial mathematics .
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
A octogenaire is hosting children with a gun in Mary for Hallwelen .
Young people aged 9 and 13 were on the doorstep in order to claim bonuses in Hallwelen .
One of the victors of the Muy &apos;s headquarters visited by children has opened the door by holding his hunting gun .
The old man , aged 86 , explained to the policemen that he had been afraid .
His weapon was seized .
The ex-Gestapo leader buried in a Jewish cemetery
MÃ¼ller , who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without any trace of it , was in fact buried in a common focal point of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin , asserting the leader of the German resistance Memorial , Professor Johannes Tuchel , in Bild .
MÃ¼ller did not survive at the end of the war .
&apos;His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grab of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte &apos; , he assured a great deal on a daily basis based on archive documents .
This revelation , 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler , would be one of the great mysteries of the war after war .
The German secret services , the BND , ensured that , in the summer of 1949 , MÃ¼ller was in Karlovly Vary , then in Czechoslovakia , according to a document obtained by Bild .
The secret services were completely wrong .
&apos;Since August 1945 , the body of MÃ¼ller was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich of the Reich by a commo &apos; , according to Mr Tuchel .
It referred to &apos; a uniform standard &apos; .
In the left pocket , in particular , there was a photograph .
Bild also publishes a paper from the town of Mitte in Berlin , which states that it was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the area .
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany , Diter Graumann , was shocked by this revelation .
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sades is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge distaste .
&apos;There is a great deal of foot for the victims &apos; .
Heinrich MÃ¼ller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been caught .
He took part in the Wanne conference in January 1942 , which decided on the &apos; final solution &apos; and , in particular , in his orders Adolf Eichmann , who was responsible for the &apos; logistics &apos; of the extermination of Jews , condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962 .

Dr Georges Bowle discovers free healthcare in Cameroon villages
Dr Bowle and his team spend almost every weekend to see hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country , barely 1 % of the population .
Vote here or via your mobile machinery
Dr Georges Bowle is one of the 10 Heros CNN of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the other 10 heroes , to elect HÃ©ros CNN of the year .
This person will receive USD 250 000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Georges Bwle watched his ill father alternating times of conscience and inconscience and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James Bwle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near YaounÃ© , the capital of Cameroon .
At the beginning , he had only a broken arm , but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain , creating a haemorrhaging whose consequences he was going to carry the rest of his life .
&apos;There was no neurosurgical in Cameroon &apos; , said Georges B. .
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money .
Instead , Dr Bowshe spent years supporting his father in crowded clinics and hospitals , so that he gets any treatment that he could enjoy .
&apos;It is not easy &apos; , adding Mr Bowit .
You can leave the house at 5 : you are going to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they are waiting for too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr Bowit &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cameroon there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants .
Even if they could see a doctor , many Cameroon could not pay for consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditure is carried out in the private sector .
&apos;The only problem they have , it is poverty &apos; , has explained Dr Bowle .
And because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
Having seen his father and so many of his compatriots suffering , Dr Bwit was determined to try to change the course .
Dr Georges Bowle and his voluntary team have carried out more than 700 surgical acts free of charge during last year .
He has become a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in YaoundÃ© .
It has created a non-profit humanitarian association , SACOW , which goes to rural areas during weekends to provide free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32 000 people .
Almost every Friday , with thirty people , they are pouring into rubbish after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and going through difficult land to go to the villages most in need .
The chance does not always follow .
They have often had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or mud routes .
But when they arrive , they are received as heroes : the community organises a festival , dancing and dance and offers them the best available housing .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and Dr Bwit - with its great smiles and energy - is more than happy to join the celebrations .
The next morning , the team is beginning to receive hundreds of patients .
&apos;We get 500 people on each visit &apos; , said Mr B. .
Sometimes they live at 60 km from the village , and they are coming up .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is provided .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive badges , a glasses of glasses collected or a free birth certificate - a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
This evening , the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anaesthetic .
The operations are generally carried out in a school , a mastery or a house ; after intervention , the patient rose and went to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen group , the operation room and the sterilisation of equipment , Dr Bowl and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
It is a feeble rate , but the musicians of villages generally help the team to remain motivated .
&apos;They are knocking on rubbres all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work &apos; .
On Sunday , the team is returning to city , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , made up of Cameroon doctors and medical students , has carried out 700 surgical acts free of charge over the last year , and he knows that their presence can make a difference to those who are helping .
A man explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a herd would allow him to work again .
&apos;This will change my future and that of my family &apos; , said man .
In addition to making this travelling hospital live and working as surgeon in hospital , Dr Bwle is also working at night in private medical firms around YaounÃ© .
It is this second job , it says , which finances 60 % of its association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&apos;I do not know when he is dormant &apos; , he said Katim O &apos;Malley , a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in the Dr Bowle Group .
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
For medical students and nursing students such as Katim O &apos;Malley , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bowit in his missions , it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home .
&apos;You have been able to take part in operations to help emulate blood or pass the instruments to Dr Bwle &apos; , explained Miss O &apos;Malley .
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are medical student in the second year .
Voluntary students generally pay their journey to Cameroon , and often arrive with the medical material collected .
But once in YaoundÃ© , their pensions , transport and education are borne by Dr Bowle .
&apos;It is a hero , there is no doubt &apos; , he said Katim O &apos;Malley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not close to extinction .
For Dr Blue , the relatively constant workload is not a problem .
Helping others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy .
&apos;I am so happy when I do that &apos; , added Mr Bowle .
I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
Ensuring people and alleviating the pain are the reasons why I do that .
Take the SACOW site to see how you help .

Is it the case that there is a flaw in amphitheatres and rooms ?
Without doubt , but by underlining the weak for the roads , Sicences-Po , the High Euds .
Arbitrous of works from others in his office in the Gaston-Gallimard street ?
Indeed , while ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher .
Dear of the fury that occupies the French Academy ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sacrosanct cannot replace the real holy oil , that of the theory , which has happened .
They have willingly recognised in him as a great sparse , a lively and a federator of their work , but pointing out that he was unwilling to produce himself .
In this uncertain image the monument of the &apos; Lessons &apos; , to which he has attached his name , has also contributed .
The bad languages were able to see a gigantic market in the chips , presented by an intelligent commentator , with a vibrant glance and leveraged , but incurably Latvian .
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who was going to do not write had a lot and a lot written .
The book that is now should be brought to justice .
Once again , however , there is the temptation of ubiquity , of an intellectual vagage , of the jubilation that has been blown up as a matter of course .
But it is easy to understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book to such a fine title bring the buck to a single passion : to discover the constitutive nose of French identity .
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity ?
Identity : it is a concern of the times .
We have been collectively invited to give a definition .
However , in the perseverance of our leaders at that time , the French identity was an inviolable petrol .
Accidents should only be deployed , and the case , Jacobinism , has to be given to the prefects and subserts , authorised interpreters .
This is something that Pierre Nora &apos;s trail is about .
It is not a heir of an eternal deceit , it is refusing to define it .
He is concerned about a family stranglehold , he is a forest of symbols , arrested at every step by a bus object , with irritating questions .
Is it the job of the company itself : why , in a country that is so long installed in its borders , which were formerly covertly chartered and united , is these dramatic calls for unity ?
They are so pressing , suggest Pierre Nora , that in order to conjure up the troubles born out of French history .
Francs and Gauts , Armagnach and Bourguignons , Catholics and Protestants : the forces of division here are very old .
The most emblematic is , of course , the one in two national history .
From the earthquake of the Revolution , the French have two histories and they have two nations , a monarchical one , the other revolutionary .
The second wanted the death of the first , but without being able to deny it ; instead , it was about finding the sacrosanct and all the more greener of unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head to the one that was the obvious and powerful embodiment .
And , of course , an invincibly binary nation , shared between left and right , secularism and Catholicism , adhering and hatred of revolution .
In order to make this unique of French identity , nothing is worth the four steps out of Hexaggerone , so that Pierre Nora &apos;s American cloud may well be the heart of his book .
After all , America and France have a revolution , written a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
However , the American kick-off is only doing better to highlight what is our own .
There are men who left their Ancian region in England and no longer had to worry about it .
Here , there are men who are crowded with an indigenous , and even more radical , Ancian Region .
This is a consensual revolution when it has sowed the drama and trust .
Here the founding fathers who are always honoured , and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make , and who have been left with the death penalty .
This is an institutional agreement , and here there is a cascade of constitutions , as so many errors to be made up and tested .
France , which is now coming ,
However , there was a time when the French believed that they could recoup the robustness of their history and overcome the curse of the figure .
In this Third Republic , which is a central and creative one , Pierre Nora has shown a great deal of interest and even tenacity : saluting those who then employed to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching schoolchildren everything in the former France , in spite of the fact that modern France was still preparing for a unified version of their history .
But this peaceful identity has had only one time .
This is once again in the debate , which is being driven by immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of the resale minorities , which are absorbed in the European area .
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France and the circumspect of France that is coming .
On top of that , the picture of the historian , which should set aside some surprises .
It is discovered that the journey was a cake .
The man of multiple cuosities turned , slightly obsessively , around the same idea .
The role of readers was at the centre of the centre .
And the one who , more than half a century ago , tabled a subject on the idea of nation , but had taken away from the initial exercise of the theory , hand us , cume salius , that he will end up doing .
Of course , in a less reasoned , more fragmented and subtle form .
But let us not deceive ourselves , just as binding .
Because much more than the figure imposed on university curricula , this throws the internal necessity of a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &apos; The return is quite complex to manage &apos; .
End in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his &apos; Antenne 2 &apos; team who visited a Hizbollah demonstration , the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later , 27 November 1987 .
Retreated since 2008 , he took part in the creation of the &apos; Outcome &apos; defence association in 2004 , which he has been chairing for several years .
Its main objective is to gain the opportunity for the hostages to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages in Aqmi ( al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) Daniel Larrebe , Thierry Dol , Pierre Lebig and Marc FÃ©ret were released on Tuesday .
After medical examinations at the military hospital in the Val-endowed , Wednesday afternoon , they have been able to find their families .
And , gradually , try to take up their lives .
&apos;The New Observer &apos; has asked Jean-Louis Normandin , 62 years , ex great postponement , which has been penalized since 2008 , the President of the &apos; Oge of the World &apos; association .
As early as the evening of your release , you were on the 20th of &apos; Antenne 2 &apos; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
In particular , in Beirut .
When I am released , I find myself in the coffer of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque .
He tells me &apos; you are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and tell me that we can still be killed .
We are very excited , but very tense too .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They are putting us on the edge .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then there is the site of hotel Summerland where the press is present .
French people lead us to the French Embassy .
It is the time of the first wirels to parents , family , friends and the press ...
I remember having taken a bath for an hour .
And having drunk in T-shirt at the French Embassy .
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani .
The tension is always there , because we do not have the means to get rid of the Larnaca airport in Cyprus .
Arrived there in helicopter , a private plane is being taken that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solzzara , where Pasqua is on board .
How was your arrival on French soil ?
There is a lot of money in Orly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
It is a bit brutal .
There is an incredible bulade .
And many media .
When there were three television channels .
I have come back and there is full .
The downgrading of the flight of the plane , the reunion with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely emotional .
Between the airport and my home , many motorcycles follow our car that Rcusher leads .
The motorists are pulling out to make photographs and follow me up to my home where I have to do a bit of the police to stop some of them .
Media pressure is enormous .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it .
There is a hole and we are suddenly under the media .
It is a little complicated , a little violent , rather complex to manage .
But we have done the hardest .
I myself am at 20th , the next day I am on the television .
Then there is a sort of adaptation to life , very slowly , for one or two months that are a little like holidays .
How did medical examinations and the DGSE deal have gone ?
I had the right to first medical control in Corsica .
The remainder was made in the Val-de facto days of my return : radio , examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that you can count on it , that it is so necessary , that we are not left to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostages .
That was logical .
I was not embarrassed .
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger ?
I am listening to what is said .
The debate on ransom in particular .
Some things irritate me , others less .
I am trying to do the part between the questions on my past as a hostage and my hat as President of the &apos; Oge of the World &apos; association , which allows me to distance myself , and I think it is far more interesting to talk .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resilience .
Above all , I am fighting , together with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostage .
In my opinion , there is a problem of semantics .
The taking of hostages &apos; political hostages &apos; - which is most of the time - must be called the hostages and allow the hostages to have access to justice , complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in compassion , in emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice ?
A court in The Hague is doing this .
Why do you not say to the hostages &apos; hostages &apos; you have flouted the rules of war , such as those of all the Geneva conventions , you will be brought to justice ? &apos;
I think that is justified , legitimate and struck in common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and I am shocked .
This is my main fight .
Egyptian Islamists
The anger in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists .
Two days before opening the trial of the war-torn President Mohamed Morsi , they took to the streets .
mobilisation throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the country &apos;s first democratically elected president .
It is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood militant .
Until now , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the documents .
This is not a trial , it is a farce .
President Morsi &apos;s trial is a false trial , which is a pro-Morsi , and he is supposed to have tried Sisi , not the opposite .
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres in Raba , the Nahda massacres , and the Republican Guard massacre .
Sisi is a liar and a traitor .
clashes erupted in Alexandria , the police used tear gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 policemen will be deployed in the Cairo Police Academy , where Mohamed Morsi will be judged .
Hagel blames 9 States
Since the federal state recognised homosexual marriage , &apos; all military spouses have a right to an identity card of the Department of Defence and to the benefits that come with &apos; , recalled the minister in New York in a speech in the Antic-Defamation League against anti-Semitism .
&apos;But some states refuse to issue these cards to the same-sex partners in the National Guard facilities &apos; , he denounced , blaming these states for violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases , or access their shops .
The Secretary of Defence has said that he has ordered the Chief Guard , General Frank Gass , to ensure that the federal law is implemented .
The head of the nine states began with the Texas , which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Textile National Guard , due to a conflict between the Textile Act and the federal law on homosexual marriage .
It was joined in its refusal by Indiana , Georgia , Florida , Misissippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Caroline and Western Virginia , according to a senior defence officer .
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to around 5600 active people , 17 000 by including the National Guard , the reserve and pensioners .
Sixthly edition of the Plasy Skateboard this Saturday in Hyres
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place on Saturday 2 November at the park park in Hyres .
Provided by the SK8 unit of the Bramp Association , competition should bring together the best skilers in the region .
The registrations are taken on the ground on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start in the crowd , at 10 o &apos;clock , before the end of 15 hours and the award of prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who , for some , are already experiencing competitions at the highest level , like the young hyerois Lorenzo Pucumbo .
Just 10 years ago , he has already won his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year , and he likes nothing so much as to go back to competitors that exceed three heads .
The Mayor of Toronto hunt for journalists on a drugs case
In Canada , the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drowning , according to several media .
A video handed to justice seems to support these suspicions .
The person concerned , Rob Ford , has always denied that he has consumed the crack , while at the same time recognising that he has a penny for cannabis .
On Thursday , he hunted from his ownership of several journalists who came to ask him .
We also think that sometimes the images do not need any explanation or comment .
A case of rage detected at a cat in the Val-de Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a chaton in the Val-de Oise , obviously of foreign origin , while France is unscathed from indigenous cases since 2001 .
The chaton was found on 25 October in Argrenehe and died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Paster Institute .
&apos;An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken in order to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this chaton between 8 October and 28 October , including , &apos; specifies the ministries of health and agriculture .
&apos;Five people who have been in contact with the chaton have already been identified &apos; and have received preventive treatment .
&apos;Come on man , the preventive treatment of human rabies , administered after contact with the porder animal , but before the symptoms appear , is very effective &apos; , and it says the communiquÃ© .
The ministries are now calling on people who would have been killed , beaten , abducted , or lacked on a mutiny or on a skin damaged by that chaton or whose animal would have been in contact with that chaton between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11.006.95 between 10 hours and 6 hours from 1 November .
&apos;France has been free from rabies since 2001 , this chaton or mother was imported from another country , not unscathed &apos; , according to the communiquÃ© .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last &apos; indigenous &apos; case of rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that &apos; France is declared officially unscathed of this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) &apos; .
A case of rabies on an illegally imported Chilean Chile was recorded in 2008 .
&apos;Ries is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time &apos; , remind ministries and it is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama &apos;s reform of the health system
In an avalanche of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguously and often repeated promise that &apos; if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it &apos; .
After hundreds of thousands of people have received statements of resilience from their providers , the Republicans have criticised the President in the last few days by accusing him of deceiving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
&apos;The vast majority of people who have a health insurance that suits them can keep it &apos; , he said in a speech in Boston .
When it comes to what it calls &apos; the current news &apos; on the issue of residues , President Obama has encouraged the Americans to take these views to seek new insurance on the market .
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health systems for the same price , or even less expensive than expected .
&apos;You will win &apos; , he said .
The administration has announced that we should not be surprised if the 5 % of the population who are making their own insurance felt forced to change regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act .
&apos;Let me address the Americans directly : you deserve better &apos; , said Kathleen Sebelius when he testifies to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Sebelius , who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , has indicated that the launch of the online market in October had failed &apos; miserably &apos; .
&apos;I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone else &apos; has added .
I look forward to regaining your confidence .
It was a Kathleen Sebelius exasperated who made this sentence , when she believed his microphone was cut off , addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the sitting of yesterday &apos;s Assembly following an exchange of contentious points of view with Billy Long , a Republican representative of Missouri , to know whether she should join the Obamacare .
For more than three hours , Billly Long repeatedly urged Mrs Sebelius why &apos; the architect &apos; of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government &apos;s sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov , which it is now vying to millions of Americans .
Towards a special cap to Abu Dhabi
The happy election , Jeike Victe Prekop , has combined the colours of the car mark and the German flag , while incorporating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the runway .
The German Sebastian Vettel , quadruple champion of the world of Formula 1 , has been tracked for the free tests of the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi on Friday a special cassque whose design was carried out by a 21 year Mexican fan .
This has chosen 1 500 designs from all over the world , as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors , a car brand and its stays .
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi , with a friend , and can therefore look closely at the German champion , on the path and in his script .
It was intended to wear this cap on Friday and Saturday , to test .
He is likely to have another special cassque on Sunday , for the race to mark his 4th consecutive world title .
An Abervilio
Let us not be mistaken .
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermine , his founder , the &apos; suburban Party &apos; is not just addressed to the bands .
I have chosen a card of France as a logo , justifies it .
When I talk about suburbs , I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , his draft , presented on Thursday at the press conference in Aubervilimo , was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism , this great cultural pot that characterises the areas .
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multiculturalism .
Abdel-Malik Djermine , 50 years , a territorial attachment , is now claiming to be &apos; 100 % apolitical &apos; even though it has not always been neutral .
In 2002 , alongside Jean-Pierre Chevin , he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if the right-wing people are prepared to support me , I will listen to them too .
There are only extremist parties .
In addition to multiculturalism , Abdel-Malik Djermine has built its consultancy programme on Internet- on many issues that are supposed to speak to the inhabitants of suburbs and , in particular , to young people : the right to vote for foreigners , legalization of cannabis , the civilian majority to 16 years , the restoration of the function of guardian of buildings ...
There is still a need to find candidates to form lists and to defend their ideas on the political scene &apos; , for the 2014 municipal elections , it is likely to be fair , he agrees &apos; .
It is a matter of time and money .
The suburban Party should nevertheless be represented in Aubervilas through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities .
Abdel-Malik Djermine has already had seven heads of the list in metropolitan France and Martinique .
&apos;And the meagre support that I have received since yesterday was not all of suburbs &apos; .
John Kerry admitted , unprecedented , that American espionage had gone too far .
John Kerry has indicated a weakening of the United States &apos; defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes by admitting , unprecedented , that , on several occasions , espionage &apos; has gone too far &apos; .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , was governed by an &apos; automatic pilot &apos; when a series of inflammatory revelations by the whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities came about .
The leaks have put the US Government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London in video liaison , Mr Kerry said : &apos; It is undeniable that the President , myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things automatic pilot because we had the opportunity , from the Second World War and to the difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 11 September . &apos;
He then became the first senior member of the United States Government to admit that American spying had gone beyond the bounds , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : &apos; In some cases it has gone too far . &apos;
And the President is resolved to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force for the good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
He added : &apos; We live in a new world where people are prepared to get caught up . &apos;
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , to blow them up and to attack governments .
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act ?
We have actually prevented aircraft from falling , building buildings and people to be murdered because we have been able to get to know the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will go to Europe to respond to the concerns about the alleged American espionage affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States , explained on Thursday the President of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs .
Senator Chris Murphy of the Connecticut said that he had spoken to the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations because of the feeling of frustration that the National Security Agency is under .
&apos;It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism &apos; , said Murphy , a democrat serving his first term , and President of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the US Senate , in an interview from Washington .
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes .
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe , which has undermined relations with some US allies , however , the director of the agency said this week that it was wrong and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about metal that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States .
Other revelations have reported that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and that of 34 other heads of state .
The Director of Intelligent Services , James Clentier , justified the espionage of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides .
In this atmosphere of tumult , Murphy indicated that his office had a trip from Congress , which is due to take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days .
He said that the route remains to be defined .
Murphy said that the aim of this journey was to make it possible to improve relations , but also to show &apos; affective firmness &apos; .
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been applying for years .
&apos;We can change our surveillance programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to spy on espionage &apos; , said Murphy .
In the meantime , Mr Kerry has planned to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the ransom generated by US strategies in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as by US surveillance activities .
The London stock exchange ended on Thursday , overshadowed by the poor results of Shell and the day after the Fed announced its support for the economy as planned .
An Australian
One of the 21 years in Sydney , sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in Phuket for wrongly alleged to have been attacked by a taxi driver , appealed to the judgment and was put under the carpet .
Stelife Rochle Bamford was first found guilty by a Court of Province in Phuket on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver , together with two other men who had control , attacked him on Sunday 10 June .
However , video recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after he was separated from his little Australian friend .
The Phuket police asked Bamford for two days before she admitted to have invented the history of all parts .
It was held in a unit of the local authority prior to the hearing before the court .
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-safety detention centre in the Phuku periphery rather than in a prison for women .
It is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of rugby Peter Tunks , who appealed to the Foreign Ministry of Canberra to help his daughter .
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the whole family was &apos; extremely concerned &apos; about the welfare of his daughter and wanted it to go to Australia .
&apos;We have of course experienced a worrying moment , but we hope to bring it back to the house as soon as possible &apos; , said Tunks .
Bamford referred to the judgment and was put in freedom after the payment of 50 000 bahs .
In Australia , the press said that , in the meantime , it was on holiday in the Krabi region , south of Thailand .
Thai judicial sources have indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket , but warned that the call could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison .
However , after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith , an Australian trip , Thailand could also seek to rekindle its deteriorating image with tourists , which could lead to an acquittal .
The French police will stop the supporters of Andersson who have come to the end of the RSCA .
The French police have decided to lay down strict rules concerning the Royal Sporting Club of Andersson against the St Gerthandset Paris on Tuesday , the spokesman for the police area from Brussels to midday on Friday .
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the CSR .
&apos;The bus convoys will be escorted by the police from a former border post in Rekem until the PSG stage &apos; has passed the spokesman .
It will be the same for return .
&apos;If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris with other means , the French police prefecture has made it known that measures have been taken to make arrests or guards to be held &apos; , yet Marie Verbeke has announced that .
Living together in French ,
In the case of the Margueriteteen-Bourgeys , 62 % of pupils have a mother tongue other than French .
This was the reason a year ago for consultation with parents , pupils , professors and members of education staff to think about how to better integrate the pupils who live in the horse between several cultures .
The school committee has just revealed its vision of &apos; Living together in French &apos; .
The Diversity of Diversity has been promoted for a year in schools to help pupils from all origins to find common benchmarks that are not confined to the French language .
The discovery of areas , our architecture , our places are benchmarks .
Large names of writers , artists , whether they are canned or come from elsewhere .
Who are our builders ?
&apos;So we create projects in such a way that they identify with all of this &apos; , explains the President of Vision diversity , Aia Kamar .
Michel Van , the New World Institute , identified several challenges for the school committee .
&apos;On the transmission , for example , of the queue culture , the sense of belonging , support for staff in the transformations that we are living in , within the student client &apos; .
The Marguerite-Bogegeys school committee has set up a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who , sometimes , come from elsewhere .
Rachida Azouz , from the University of Montreal , will be the scientific director .
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context , quebris .
&apos;Different educational strategies , that is the real need &apos; .
Research will be carried out on the inclusion of all its angles : linguistic , school , social and cultural .
