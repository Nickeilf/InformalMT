The Spectrum
The sportswoman , Jhonathan Florez , marched a helicopter over Bogota , the Colombian capital .
With a win-win ( a combination of love ) , it went to 160 km / h above the notorious Monserramite sanctuary , located at more than 3 000 metres of altitude , where many badges had gathered to observe its feat .
A black box in your car ?
While the planners of the United States &apos; road network find it difficult to find the money needed to repair the motorway motorway infrastructure , there are many who see a solution in the form of a small black box that is set above the scoreboard of your car .
The appliances , which record all the miles of a motorist and transmit information to officials , are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the planning government offices to redesign the obsolete system of financing the main US roads .
The sector usually without interest in the planning of major axes has suddenly provoked a lively debate and heated alliances .
The libertarians have joined green groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles that you , and possibly the road on which you are circulating , then use the information to draft a tax bill .
The Tea Party is landed .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And , while Congressional members cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
They are looking for how , over the next decade , they can move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Thousands of motorists have already embarked on these black boxes , sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system , for an experimental vice .
This is absolutely essential for our nation .
‘ It is not as if we had the choice ’ , said Hasan Ikrata , Director-General of the Southern California Association of Goverine , which states that the state will start to record the miles travelled by each California motorist by 2025 .
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the country ’ s Highway Trust Fund , financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the pump , is financially .
Americans are no longer buying as much petrol as before .
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon .
The federal tax itself , which is 18.4 cents per gallon , has not increased for 20 years .
Politicians are reluctant to increase tax , even 1 % , while petrol prices are high .
&apos;The petrol tax is simply not sustainable &apos; , said Lee Munnich , a specialist in transport policy at the University of Minnesota .
Its state has recently set up traces of 500 cars to test a system of payment for miles .
“ This is the most logical alternative in the long term , ” he said .
Wonks are calling for the cost of using them per kilometre .
It is not surprising that the idea of the city of the city is that it is a matter of seductive liberals , since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California planners are interested in the system as they draw up strategies to achieve the goals set out in the ambitious state laws on global warming .
But the representative of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives , Bill Bill Suster , said that he also regarded him as the most viable alternative in the long term .
The free-market supporters of the Reasia Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay .
&quot; This is not just a tax on a large black hole , &quot; said Adrian Moore , Vice-President of politics at the Reasia Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits they are given .
The movement is also supported by two former US secretaries in Transport , who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to go down the path of payment .
The US Senate approved a pilot project of 90 M last year , which would have been about 10 000 cars .
But the presidency of the House killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or town .
Several states and large cities nonetheless make progress on their side .
The most determined is Oregon , which has mobilized 5 000 drivers to carry out the country &apos;s most important experience .
These motorists will soon pay the state for kilometric costs instead of petrol taxes .
The Nevada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City is considering one .
Illinis is trying to test a limited number of lorries .
And the I-95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the US coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) is looking into how to implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the Nevada , where around 50 voluntary car drivers recently fitted their car , drivers were worried that the government would be able to follow their cheapest and gestures .
“ The concerns about Big Brother , and this kind of thing are a big problem , ” said Aluddin Khan , who leads the strategic management of performance at the Transports Department of the Nevada .
That is not something that people want .
From the beginning of the trial , the Nevada Nevada was warning on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into a fully-fledged location . ”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep people &apos;s record record and daily .
The Nevada is one of the few states that are now moving to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car is running , but without knowing the place or the exact time .
If we can do that , then added Khan , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of California for the name of True Mileage .
Originally , society was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes on the Member States .
It sought to penetrate the emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay according to their kilometre .
But the appliances that it is testing have planted the planners of major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information , periodically downloaded .
‘ People will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not locate them ’ , said Ryan Morrison , Director-General of True Mileage .
Large errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some Member States .
There are far cheaper means and much less intrusive methods of proceeding .
In Oregon , planners are trying to experience the experiment by offering the drivers different choices .
They can choose an aircraft with or without GPS .
They can still choose not to have anything at all , preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing aircraft to do more , rather than not enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials seek to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees , provide &apos; payment for driving &apos; and create a set of data on real speed from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion .
&apos;The car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the advantages of the system &apos; , indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some of the transport planners are asking whether the whole debate on the payment of mine is not simply a huge diversion .
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission Commission in the San Francisco Bay area , those responsible say that Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund ’ s bankruptcy by increasing petrol taxes .
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol , so everyone pays their fair share .
‘ There is no need to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin ’ , said that the director of the legislation and of public affairs in the committee is to be found in the committee .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bowe :
The English musician has not come to an end this year .
From The Next Day , appeared in January , he concocted a luxury recreation scheduled for 4 November , with a number of reports .
Four have already emerged on the Tole .
The announcement of a new almm of David Bowie had left the whole world .
On the day of its 66th birthday , 8 January 2013 , he said that a new almm would emerge in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last time , Realty , the date of 2003 ) and too few public appearances , the English musician showed that he could still count on him to scrap the pop .
A festival for his fans
Not as a result of surprises , David Bowie had more of a turn in his bag with The Next Day .
The Thin White Duke therefore planned to reconstruct this almm on 4 November .
On the occasion , he concocted a real festival for his fans .
This reedition , entitled The Nexat Day Extra , will be presented in the form of three discs : the original almum , the unprecedented session sessions and the bulls , and a DVD containing the four clips already uncovered .
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles in relation to the original almm : the three pieces of the Deluxe edition , five songs specifically unveiled on the occasion , and two cures .
David Bowia has made the presentations of this beautiful cofft in a video .
It introduces both the record and the accessories provided with : exclusive photographs and poles , a carnet to share its own impressions , a hand-back with words ...
And , above all , it gives a foretaste of its new title Atomica , typically in the vein of The Next Day , with very strong guides and robustly controlled electricity .
Already
But Atomica is not the only title to disclose his weapons .
The Informing , Like A Roket Man , Born In A UFO , is also available on the web .
The Informed is in double front : a worrisome interferee before a light cavallat that is gradually slowing down to allow a bulldozer to take place .
On Like A Rocket Man , did Boys want to make a small reference to the Roket Man of Elton John , or even to High Representative ?
With this headline title , the singer seems in any case to be in his or her position when he no longer has their feet on the ground .
In addition , it was much more serious .
On Born In A UFO , David Boy once again refers to his stranglehold : would he come from another planet ?
There is a desire to leave the Earth .
At any rate , we have been amused to play in camera with these titles : an informal tower , a man on a rocket , a Marine potential ...
It conceals and reveals the need for different personalities , as he has done throughout his career , particularly with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane .
It is no wonder that he has a mask in his hands in the photograph of the Investigation in Boyage , of the Louis Vuitton , whose new face he embodies .
It will appear in one of their advertisements , broadcast from 10 November .
The Defense Minister , Rob Nicholson , insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summoned to the Canadian armed forces , and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life .
Attressed by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons , Mr Nicholson ensured that before their release , members of the army were following a transitional plan with their superiors .
All wounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life , and none of them is released before they are ready .
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured military - who do not comply with the rule of &apos; the universality of the army &apos; to require staff to carry out a range of different tasks - to reach the 10 years admissibility period required for pension provision .
In particular , they mentioned two cases reported by the Presse Canadians , including that of a soldier released last Friday .
Corporal David Hawkins , a London reservist , in Ontario , reached post-traumatic stress syndrome , was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to be able to receive fully indexed retirement .
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirres , who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before he was ready because he did not respond to the rule of universality of the service .
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared , with plans and consultation meetings , but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said in a meeting with Presse Canadian on Wednesday .
For months I asked whether there was a way to stay , and they said no .
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has been struggling to determine which latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in ranks , but who are not fit for the fight .
Under current rules , the injured soldiers are up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons , 199 did not reach the service period required to obtain pension benefits .
The liberal spokesperson for former combatants , Jim Karygiannis , called on Wednesday the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins , while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to &apos; this shameful practice &apos; .
Disney on the Truth
The American media and entertainment group has decided to give priority to the tablets on its own television channels for the next round of children to come out .
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Calliers Wild West will be available from 24 November on the watchdisne-junior.com website or through its application for telephones and tablets .
Its global launch on the Disney Group chains is planned until 2014 , details the communiqué of its Disney Junior division .
The lively design , aimed at children aged 2-7 , tells the adventures of the chatte Callie , the sheriff of an American city in the West , where it is putting order in order with a magic laso .
Every episode includes two stories of 11 minutes .
&apos;Intervention with smartphonies and tablets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commented on Albert Cheng , Vice-President responsible for digital products at Disney / ABC Television Group , cited in the communiqué .
This kind of experience between Disney efforts to &apos; extend the life span of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important &apos; has added .
A survey published earlier by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of the less than 2 years have already served a tablet or a telephone , and 72 % of the less than eight years , respectively 10 % and 38 % two years ago .
Snowden
Edward Snowden , the whistleblowers of the US intelligence service , said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities .
The German MEP , Hans-Christian Stöbele , met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he has the right to asylum , to discuss his testimony in Germany .
In a letter which the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr Snowden said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . &apos;
However , saying the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against it .
As part of the complaint lodged by the US Department of Justice , he is accused of espionage and theft of state property .
Hans-Peter Friedrich , the German Minister for Home Affairs , said in Zeit Online : “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German officials , we will make sure that we make that possible . ”
Relations between the US and Germany have been severely tested following complaints that the NSA had been listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .
Thomas Optuhotn , the Member who runs the parliamentary group overlooking the foreign secret services , has indicated that if there is a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &apos; without jeopardising and completely ruining relations with the United States &apos; , we should benefit from it .
Mr Stöbele , a Member of the German Verde , published a photograph with him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account .
During his visit to Russia he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr Stöbele said that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant , Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr Snowden was in Germany , he would have to be assured that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , said the honourable Member .
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he was the subject of a &apos; serious and sustained &apos; persecution campaign which forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction to &apos; my act of political expression &apos; .
Citizens throughout the world , as well as senior officials – including the United States – found that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility .
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Cogeco Caster
Cogeco Caster ’ s subscribers may have access to applications like Facebook , Twitter , and ultimate video service on Netflix demand via their television in a future that does not seem so far away .
The Cogeco subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options &apos; , explained the President and head of the management of Cogeco , Louis Audet , in interview .
Cogeco Castable thus follows his competitors , such as Belgium , even though Cogeco ’ s subsidiary has not yet had a clear date on this new platform .
&apos;We must adapt and change or resist change and fail &apos; .
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers are currently denied access .
The telecoms giant Rogoers has already indicated that it could offer networks if certain technical details , which were not mentioned , could be resolved .
In the United States , the popular video service says that it is in discussions with some major cables so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
Cogeco and Cogeco Caster also welcomed the announcement by the Harper government in his Totine speech on 16 October .
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay services on the map .
&apos;It is about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains , it does not work &apos; , said Mr Audet .
It hopes , however , that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council ( CCTC ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television &apos; , said the &apos; de Cogeco &apos; .
The CCTC has been holding consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring .
As far as the results are concerned , Cogeco has indicated that there has been a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 .
This is a retrograde step compared to the net profit of 44.9 million , or 83 per cent , of the same period last year .
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by means of depreciation costs linked to new acquisitions .
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Badband cable in 2012 in the United States for 1.36 billion .
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal .
Last December , the Estonian company also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprise , an Internet supplier in Vancouver for the sum of 526 million .
As for Cogeco ’ s income , they grew 41.5 % in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million .
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Cogeco Caster , was 43.9 million , or 90 % , in decline compared with the 45.7 million , or 93 % , of the same period last year .
But Cogeco Caster ’ s income has increased by 45 % to 470.4 million .
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter .
However , for the 2013 financial year , the number of customers in Cogeco Castable is growing 5546 .
Mr Audand is not concerned about the number of customers changing in this way .
For me , this is not an indication of a change of trend , he has observed .
It varies from one quarter to the next with very strong competition .
Hhorse in beef products
Hepal meat was found in bovine bovine boxes , sold by two small British Lower Lessons , announced today the food hygiene agency .
routine tests have revealed that products , produced in January in Romania and sold by the Bogans and Quality Save chains , contained the DNA of horses of 1 to 5 % .
&apos;Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the British agency .
A scandal about the presence of horses in cooked flats broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests in Ireland .
According to European Commission reviews , France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that were supposed to contain only beef .
A collision between two vehicles left four wounded , early on Friday , on road 131 in Lanaudière .
Shortly before 4th , a motorist who was circulating in the north , in Saint-Féician de Valois , lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured , but they were not afraid for their lives .
The movement had returned to normal to 6th , Friday .
Frontier Airlines
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $ 100 for passengers transporting hand luggage on its flights .
Frontier Airlines plans to start making up to $ 100 for a hand and $ 2 baggage for a coffee or a soda , although in its announcement on Wednesday , it indicated that passengers could take the unopened cane with them on the descent of the plane .
The new baggage costs are the bags in the higher compartment , so the small bags in the seat will always be free .
Frontier said that it would pay $ 25 if the costs were paid in advance and $ 100 if the travellers paid only once on the doorstep .
The Frontier spokesman , Kate O &apos;Malley indicated that the $ 100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance .
‘ We do not want to pay that price ’ , she explained .
The airlines started to make the first and second luggage recorded in 2008 .
Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in hand-in-hand luggage in higher compartments , so there was often no room for these compartments .
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers transport fewer things on board .
Mr Malley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a question of making it clear to the clients of Frontier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in higher compartments .
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger queuing up on a boarding doorstep could carry a sack free , while the next person in the queue could have to pay $ 100 for a similar bag .
Mr Malley has explained that the site and registration procedures of Frontier are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they reach the door .
Frontier baggage charges will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Passengers often rouse on baggage and other charges , but airlines love them .
They believe that the handling costs of luggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it .
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them did not go to baggage .
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first baggage charges three years ago , and the low-cost airline Allongiant followed a little later .
The only other company that imposes such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air , which has declared the consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen , who is closely following the costs .
He estimated , in a report in December 2011 , that Spirit ’ s handbags were $ 50 per year .
Sorensen , a former framework of Midwest Airlines , recently traveled to Spirit and asked what it was going to find on the doorstep at a time when passengers would discover the unfamiliar hand charges imposed by the company .
‘ I had never seen an infringement procedure as fluid in my professional career ’ , he said .
I was expecting teeth and a baggage burst at the door .
The plane was full , he added , &apos; the passengers are on board at the speed of clarity &apos; .
Frontier is also like Spirit and charges $ 2 for a coffee , a thé , a soda or a fruit juice .
Frontier has indicated that passengers taking a soft or a juice can take the cane with them , and those who make coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
US Airways briefly tried to make drinks pay for drinks in 2008 , but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large airline had followed .
The decision by Frontier to make hand-in-hand baggage charges when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to their site .
Airlines pay for online trips like Orbiz $ 10 to $ 25 for each sold ticket .
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency .
However , Frontier has gone further in this area .
In September , she began to offer only half of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it has reduced the premiums by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a Frontier trip de1 000 miles bought with an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site .
Frontier has a true client in his home town , Denver , but his activity is declining and it loses money .
The revenue fell by 9 % and its flight capacity fell by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company , Public Airways Holdings Inc .
The public has tried to redress Frontier finances by selling the airline .
NSA
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , not hackers , as some had claimed online .
&quot; NSA.gov remained unattainable for a few hours this evening because of an internal error which took place during a planned update &apos; , indicated the espionage agency in a declaration by email .
The problem will be resolved this evening .
The allegations that the breakdown was due to a service denial denial of service ( DSD ) are false .
Earlier this evening , online servers of servers noted that the NSA site was at least 6 p.m. , and some users still cannot access the site .
Earlier , a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency &apos;s sensitive internal network was not a compromise .
No classified information is in danger , explained the spokesperson .
At least a group of online haktivists has claimed to be responsible for the NSA ’ s breakdown with a DSD attack .
The DSD attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated , and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system .
The formerly secret NSA , a time called “ No Such Ageny , ” has been in the spotlight and strongly criticised in recent months as a result of a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at national and abroad – which are among the NSA ’ s secret files and disclosed by the former disenchanted NSA consultant , Edward Snowden .
This growing controversy over the agency caused much speculation that this evening &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation .
The Delta Center now closed
The Dta Cent-Ville hotel closed on Thursday in Montreal after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that owned the edifice sold it to promoters who will turn it into student homes .
Three hundred and fifty people were working in the hotel .
Of these , 200 have still not found new jobs .
Delta promises not to let his employees fall .
Employers have come to meet employees directly on the spot , and the employees have met their needs individually .
&apos;This is going to continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the working relations of Hoptelta Delta , Felix Benisson .
The closure of the Delta comes in a highly competitive hotel market .
The investment fund that was the owner of that construction had choices to make .
Either he reinvested in building it to continue to operate , so there were investments of tens of millions while competition is very fierce , there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal .
&apos;Or either he sell it to someone else , and that is what has happened &apos; , explains Paul Arsenult , who is the holder of the Tourism Tradar Car to the AWAM &apos;s Waste School .
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months , such as the Crown Plaza , which will become a residence for the elderly .
In the meantime , four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 chambers will come into being within two years .
For the CEO of Titan , &apos; Gooddyear Amiens &apos; purchase project begins with zero employed &apos; .
Having cast a fence in January for the partial recovery of the Goodadar website promised to closure , Mauritius Taylor , the CEO of the American Typical Ptymaker , is now declaring himself ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 of the plant .
Arnaud Monteburg , the Minister for productive recovery , had already announced it on Monday 21 October .
Having given up on the draft purchase of the plant in January , you are now returning .
You spoke of violent attacks and insults , talking about &apos; so-called workers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; mad &apos; unions , targeting the GTT .
We do not understand this U-turn .
Is it to please Mr Monteburg ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Save my wife .
Mr Monteburg is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
If I have wounded someone with my words , I am sorry .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Is the truth ?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries is working eight hours handicaps France .
In India , in China and in other countries , we are working ten to twelve hours a day .
But I do not have any prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tyres , has good equipment , is well located , and has spaces for enlargement .
Why does Titan need this plant so much ?
There is no need to buy this plant .
But , with the right price and the competent workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Gooddyear ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Goodyear had offered employees a good start , I think 100 % of employees would have accepted it .
Now let us imagine that Tantan is buying the closed factory in Gooddyar .
Therefore , Tantan could move machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency .
I think Mr Monteburg knows this .
He wants to keep the factory in Amiens with at least 333 well-paid jobs .
Tantan agrees to recruit them among the 1 200 current employees of Gooddyear .
That is why Mr Monteburg needs a commitment from Tantan before trying to get the CGT to sit down with Gooddyar .
The first step is that the CGT and Gooddyear should have an agreement on the starting allowance for all employees .
Therefore , there will be no more employees at the factory .
Mr Monteburg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm that ?
The only number I have mentioned to the Minister is 333 .
I know he would like a four-year guarantee .
But , as I told you , the CGT and Gooddyear must first agree on the starting point .
If all employees accept them , the purchase project of the factory starts with zero .
How can we provide guarantees of employment when there are no more employees at the site ?
If Mr Monteburg succeeds in getting the CGT and Gooddyear to agree , and that Titan is buying the factory , then we intend to remain in North North for more than four years .
The profit of Bommerdier , while the deliveries and orders of aircraft
Bombardier Inc , Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer , signalled a 15 % drop in its net profits on Thursday , under pressure from a drop in orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its island division .
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not provide flight testing data for his or her new CSeries aircraft or information to know whether the plane will comply with its ambitious timetable for commercial service before September .
After the inauguration of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago , it has been stolen only three times , and the question then arose as to whether the trial phase was on the right track .
The results did not match the forecasts and the stock prices fell by 8 % on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Cameroon Doerksen , analyst in the National Bank Financial Bank , lowered the rating on Thursday , going from “ overperformance ” to “ sector performance , ” owing to the low potential for the stock market in the next quarter or two quarters .
‘ Although the decline in the supply of aircraft has been largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the transport division ’ , declared Cameron Doerksen on a note to customers .
We believe that Bombardier will register new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight testing programme moves forward .
However , if no new order is announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
Bomard hopes that the family of CSeries aircraft can catapult in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus .
The first trial plane was unveiled in March and went for the first time in September after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has been modest up to 177 , and it seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate society &apos;s claims about energy efficiency and the potential for economies of the new airplane .
At present , the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators .
Pierre Beauto , President and head of the leadership , is convinced that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft commercial service .
The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was proceeding according to the timetable .
&apos;The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected &apos; , said Mr Beauowe at a telephone conference , adding that the ground tests and the software updates were provided for during the flight time .
Each manufacturer is planning differently .
We decided to carry out a first flight and to provide for an update period , and that is what we have done .
This will happen throughout the flying programme .
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks , the rest will follow shortly afterwards , has indicated society .
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight .
Bombardier has indicated that she is assessing the timetable for entry and will provide new information in the coming months .
“ The slow pace of flight trials – though apparently in keeping with the internal timetable of Bombardier – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015 , said Mr Doerksen .
In the third quarter , on 30 September , Bombardier ’ s net benefit fell to 147 M , or 8 cents per action , compared to $ 172 , or 9 cents per year , a year earlier .
The result of adjusted action has remained unchanged at 9 cents .
The income has declined slightly from 4.2 to $ 4.1 trillion .
Analysts expected a 10 cents of action , and $ 4.56 trillion , according to Thomas Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that it delivered 45 planes in the quarter , compared to 57 a year earlier .
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft , compared to 83 before .
The delay in the Aeronautical division was $ 32.9 Min to 30 September , which was unchanged compared to 31 December of the previous year .
&apos;In Aeronautics , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing &apos; , said Mr Beauowe .
Aeronautical incomes have fallen by 13 % to $ 2 trillion .
Bombardier , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , said that the income from this division had risen by nearly 11 % to $ 2.1 trillion .
The orders for the Trans-sports division total $ 32.6 trillion to 30 September , a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year .
The margins for the transport division have suffered from implementing problems for a few large contracts .
The leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter .
The course of Bombardier &apos;s actions , which also announced that Patrick Pichette , the head of the Google Inc Financial Directorate , would sit on the Management Board , fell from 8.5 % to USD 4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazilian company Embraer SA , the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor to Bombardier , indicated on Thursday a 10 % drop in its quarterly benefit .
Two spraeologists of 23 and 27 years were missing in a chasm under the Dhave of Croes since Thursday evening , was taught on Friday at the rescue of the Isle of the Isle .
They have been located on this Friday afternoon .
The two men , a twist , in practice and the other no , went on the ground on Thursday to 9.30 p.m. in order to make a crossing of the Dess of Croats , located on the common Saint Pierre-de-Chartree .

&quot; Sploeologists should have come out around 5th of the morning &quot; , said Thierry Larbe , technical adviser to the Speleo rescue assistance .
Tens of people on the ground
There were some 20 secresists , ten members of the French Speleo rescue , as well as police , CRS and firefighters .
At the end of the afternoon this Friday , the two samples were localised .

German journalists to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists ’ union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about US and British intelligence activities .
&apos;The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid the use of search engines and of Google and Yahoo &apos; , in a communiqué .
It considers the Washington Post ’ s information to be “ outrageous , ” according to which the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) and the United Kingdom ’ s GCHQ ( GCHQ ) have collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronise their servers .
&apos;Research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &apos; , added Michael Konken , the President of the trade union , claiming 38,000 members .
Few
The plan by the Minister , Brigitte Grouwels , of &apos; reconnecting &apos; fixes of traffic lights in Brussels does not like everyone .
As a reminder , the Brussels Minister of Labour and Transport , on Thursday at the centre of Brussels , launched a test project to paint 16 potems of traffic lights from the region to the yellow and blue colours in Brussels .
The aim is both &apos; to increase security &apos; and &apos; the Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long term , to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
However , the blue chosen by the Minister is &apos; too wet &apos; , according to the Brussels MEP Emmanuel De Bock , who speaks of the &apos; flames &apos; of the capital and calls for the &apos; resignation &apos; of Brigitte Grouwels .
&apos;Not content to spend the money on the Brussels of the Brussels and the Brussels Region &apos; s money on the fringe operations of the Brussels Region , Brigitte Grouwels , is continuing its operations on the capital of capital .
After his tax-mane-mane-manual taxis , she finally painted the potems of Brussels in the dark .
According to the honourable Member , there is no longer &apos; more difference of visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels &apos; .
Brussels deserves better than to see their money being wasted by a Minister CD VV , who itself carries out the NVA programme .
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders .
&apos;To recall , Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes to 0.5 % of Brussels ! &apos; , concludes Mr De Bock .
The Pont-Buis Pass
The Pont-De-Buis eco-tax , on which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax was held on Saturday , was dismantled on Thursday morning .
The graves arrived on the ground shortly after 10 hours , and movement on the national side was hijacked .
The decommissioning decision , announced by the Premier of the Finister on Wednesday , was taken by the company Ecomouv , the pork manager .
It is the last of the three ecotax portals that are operating in the Department of the Final , the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged .
Google Glass
A online shop , offering multiple accessories to Google Glass , has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of connected glasses signed by Google .
In this way , they can acquire an eye-opener , a charger , or even a badge .
This shop , which is strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass , proposes a few accessories such as a charger and his cable USB .
For the same price , it is also possible to acquire a protective house manufactured in micro fibre or intra-aux headphones .
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass fitted with correction virtues , no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed .
Five years ago , my father lost the world of living .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking to him now ,
I was so afraid to forget this , or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to &apos; attend &apos; .
There is no recipe , no way of working to move the wall of the invisible and regain its own .
Then there are signs .
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving .
Once again , a double awakening in the middle of the night to look at his shows that no longer leaves me on the night table .
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures .
Our mother left us after her exhausted fight against cancer .
That is at least what I thought of the day when I found his empty body , cracked down on this hospital bed to cheated flags .
Likewise , his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the scant light of the chasm that controlled her coffin .
I thought it was a part .
Little by little , by small , balance-of-balnal appearances , a little timid , a little wielded , it quickly returned to my mind , moving as it took its place in the landscape of my thought that believed in mourning .
And then it turned out to be at the heart of my own facets that I had not yet seen , masked by my relationship with her .
I therefore learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother , but simply a woman whom I was not really aware of , a woman who embodied this person , during her stay in life .
In dying , this woman had a perfect life and liberated the person I love , and here I found her , full and full .
This is the most unexpected and beautiful way forward .
It is a privilege to know that the loved people are never leaving us .
I resemble my father , &apos; in deed as well as he did &apos; .
I have always been told .
I never believed it at that time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , sick .
Here I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him .
One day he died .
For a long time , he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I was wrong ...
He spoke to me , he was constantly encouraging me , he was my body .
I saw his hands when looking at mine , I lent my body .
But it was never indiscreet .
I have had a personal life .
It left me intimate .
It lasted for a long time and one day .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I no longer know who said that the people who died are not forgotten but invisible .
My parents are no longer , but I am constantly in favour of them .
Every event , every moment of my life makes me feel that I am here because I always refer to it : what would have been said ?
I always dream of them , perhaps not every nights but several times a week .
I often dream of the last few moments I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this moment .
I often wake up to anguish when that happens , and I feel that they are not here .
Sometimes , some dreams are directed at me and are part of my history , and indeed they continue to live and share my life .
The day before I had to know the sex of my baby , I dreamt that I woke up , I was lying out , my father was waiting for me and he smiled me and was delighted that I was waiting for a small boy .
The next day , I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy to share what I had .
And of course it was a small boy in my venue .
I wanted to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell the common memory after his death .
Five years ago , my grandmother died as a result of cancer .
A year ago , she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
It is the shock that his disappearance caused the young baster that I was at the time .
However , I have done my mourning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , especially in times when I find myself in difficulty , or when I have to take important decisions .
To look to the Arabic and to interest me in the Middle East , to the point of making a mockery of it in a great school , has not been , with the hindsight , of anodine choices .
In fact , I was often hearing it Arab in my childhood , and talking about Morocco , where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values that she has accused me are still present , so I think I can think of how she would like me to act at some point .
The same applies to my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and the righteousness of the spirit that was a believers believers .
From now on , I feel like a daily presence , a benevolent soul , a salvory spirit .
I see his eyes .
My mother died 19 years ago .
Morte after I spoke to the telephone .
I have gone through all the phases : incomprehension , anger , pain , the beaches that are going on on their own , anywhere , whenever , in unsolicited places , incongruous times .
Then time has calmed the sentence .
It has remained only the lack , this empty vacuum , and the need for it , to entrust me , to reassure me that it is soft .
However , it is there , a silent presence , it is there and I am looking at it .
All the morning , I see his concern about me , I see the rings that are increasing their eyes , the ripples around the lips that cigarettes are growing , the plates that mark the front days of concern .
My mother has taken on my face and she is looking at me every morning in my mirror .
All the morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and mother of my three children died from cancer to 43 years .
Its protection is constantly being felt , nothing serious can happen .
It was his promise on his beacon of pain , so little has been learned to smile , and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I speak to him in the crux of the night when the absence is too bad , she invites in my dreams when the morale is a little achieved .
We feel that we are being caught and protected in difficult times , the time has come for us to realise how the orchestra , and we are trying to stay on the path we have outlined .
If you were very keen to be a member of the House , the absence of it could not take you from heart and memories .
In some ways , loved ones become your internal energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked .
I was not able to witness his humination and three weeks after his death , I gave birth to a small boy .
If I have my convictions at times , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision .
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me , it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , I do not know , and I always wonder what it will be about .
I do not know whether I have adopted its way of being or whether I am just like him : is this genetic ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a change of ego , there was no need to speak between us .
In short , he is here on a daily basis .
I feel that he is here and that makes me happy .
It is almost 30 years since my husband died at the age of 33 .
I had 28 years and our son six years .
The immense sentence that then invaded me has , of course , lessened , but it is always close to me .
Very often he &apos; land &apos; in my dreams in such a precise way , so vivid that I am even more sad to see that this was only a dream .
On the other night , he asked me whether I was going well , I told him no , he said &apos; I am descent &apos; but with such a real voice that I woke up to my breath , anguish and kicking the lamb of horses and watching all the people who believe it will happen .
I still live in the same house , and often I feel that I am watching and I look back to see if he is not here , I know he is him and I am speaking to him .
In all the coins I feel that I am here and that makes me happy .
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and the spirit lives with me .
I have 58 years , I have always lived alone since its departure , and it is and will remain the love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am a socially-responsible job , and I am , I am glad , I am grandmother , I have full friends , but my heart and soul belong to her and I am never talking about her except my son , and I am never going to the cemetery .
Iraq : October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008 .
This Friday , Baghdad published official figures : 964 people lost their lives last month : 855 civilians , 65 policemen and 44 soldiers .
This publication takes place on the day that the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President .
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the US .
&apos;We are not saying to the world that we stand by our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , said al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington .
And , because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved , this will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also expand .
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives ?
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
Outside the building , demonstrators protested against the Iraqi leader .
They used placards accusing him of being a murderer and calling on the US to refuse to provide aid .
The cocainic lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned in prison .
Basharat Ditta , 42 years , provided information to the criminal lord Neil Scarrough
The lawyer was afraid that his covert drug addiction was revealed to the great day .
He was sentenced to a prison sentence of three years by the Liverpool Living Court in Liverpool .
A great defence lawyer who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his covert drug addiction was not revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Basharat Ditta , 42 years , gave sensitive information to the warlord Neil Scarrough concerning investigations into his drug-related activities after having compromised because of his habit of eating cocaine .
The lawyer , who was known as &apos; Bash &apos; and considered by criminals as a &apos; prime issue &apos; , was arrested at home in 2011 following police listening operations directed at Scarborough , which he represented at a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials have repaired Sarborough , 32 years ago , by tabling three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn in Lancashire , while he was at a dinner of Barreau with colleagues .
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of this class ’ A drugs after tests showed traces of cocaine in its hair , portfolio , and credit cards .
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought illegal information about the arrest of two men on the Scarborough account and one of his associates .
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .
With 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for a sum of £ 1.5 million , as well as over £ 200 000 in cash in a series of raids .
Titta , 42 years , provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be exposed to the day .
Today , at the Liverpool in Liverpool , Titta , who works in the cabinet of Forbes Solidarity , located in Blackburn , fell out of office after having been found guilty of two charges of impediment to justice after a three-week trial .
He admitted the possession of cocaine in a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating Scarborough , discovered that he was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .
Two investigators followed the suspect and returned to the home of Ditta and put drugs , pure to 60 % , under the banner of the lawyer in a black golf gang .
Shortly after the submission , Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta , who was at a dinner at the Football Park football stadium , a forum of the Blackburn Rotwerp club .
The lawyer has returned to his home , has discovered drugs and has been telephoned on nine occasions .
The court has heard that Ditta is a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests have shown traces of such a class drugs in its hair , portfolio , and credit cards .
Titta was arrested later but denied cocaine ; he said that he had spoken about the alleged drug trafficking because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a &apos; legal privilege &apos; .
During his arrest , Ditta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards , but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken .
He said during an interrogation that he had an office at home , as well as in his place of work , and that there were customers who call him home for legal matters .
But the court has heard evidence that he has been calling major players in the drug trade , some of whom he had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware .
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said : &apos; If anyone is aware that the law must not be violated , it is a criminal lawyer . &apos;
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer , and of having too much involvement with individual customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug trafficking , but a drug trafficking that provides drugs to its own lawyer .
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer .
But that went far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client .
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Ditta did not honour his profession , but did not honour him .
It has been too close to some customers , especially Scarborough , and has allowed its independence to be compromised .
Titta has denied any illegal action and said : &apos; If I was a corrupt lawyer , what I am not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough , I would not have waited 15 hours , I would have done so immediately . &apos;
But after the hearing , the overarching Lee Halstead of the Lahishire Policy said : &apos; Mr Ditta has gone from a criminal lawyer to criminal himself as he began to buy drugs from criminal organisations . &apos;
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made it vulnerable to the motives of leaders of organised criminal groups who have charged him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations .
Lawyers should observe the most stringent rules of integrity and create a climate of trust among the public .
Mr Ditta has betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the virtues of his profession .
The serious and organised crime unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation into Mr Ditta , who was found guilty of the three heads of charge of cocaine possession and now obstructs justice , demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminal criminals .
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts .
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in heroin , cocaine and cannabis .
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 153 years of drug trafficking .
On his website , Ditta organised a sitting of questions / answers on himself during which he said that his dream would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his last guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work .

Reducing the cost of its Christmas illumberations
There are 420 reasons , 2.2 kilometres of seaboard , which are covered by a sledgehammer of light : one could close the bud in Mon with the bill for illumination .
Fishing , which , unlike many municipalities , is in no way regulated by taxpayers , and not by trade associations .
In order to ease its costs , the city is using leaps .
However , there is also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations .

The Traditional Long
Each time it is the school clientele that will be targeted , an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season .
By means of five saynates imagined and interpreted by artists in the region , the sticks with a high dose of humour , young people are allowed to learn the classical script .

In addition to this , there was the lyrical Appendix , which was held last August , with the help of the soccano coloriature Marie-Eve Munders .
It was activity-benefit , along with the artistic dimension , and it helped the non-profit body to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet as an air in the mouse .
Without giving any precise figures , the President of the Management Board , Yves Bergeron , took advantage of yesterday &apos;s press meeting in Chumtimi to be reassuring .
Despite the precariousness of so many cultural institutions , the future is emerging , even in the long term .

Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to stand in court on Friday .
calls for collective redress against the Swite-Crice brothers
A new request for collective redress has been lodged against the Sainte-Cross brothers , on sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the Saint-Joseph orbit and in several orphanages , colleges and schools .
The request is based on the shark &apos;s testimony , identified as &apos; J.J. &apos; , which would have been masquished in the 1950s , first in Nos. Dame-De-Neiges by his professor , the brother , the Father , Father Bernard , at the Saint Saint Joseph orbit , where he was used as a mouse and where his father worked as paintings .
The first resort was only three institutions , and when the regulation was announced , many people said to us : &apos; I was in that place , I can register myself &apos; , tell the lawyer Alain Arsenult , who defends the victims in both cases .
The collective redress that has just been tabled is a special feature of allowing complainants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Saint Cross congestion .
At the moment , the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim that they have been attacked by the Saint Cross brothers .
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s .
The appeal also stresses that the rule of Saint Cross and the St Joseph orbit , which is a separate entity , &apos; have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &apos; , that they &apos; have exercised a moral , religious and psychological constraint on the victims &apos; , that they &apos; knew about the sexual abuse of the victims and have nevertheless stifled them &apos; , and that they have &apos; consciously and consciously chosen to ignore the problem &apos; .
The latest accusations are based on letters drawn up by the lawyer of the Saint-Cross brothers , Me Emil Perrin , in the 1990s , but also by the research into the archives on this subject by brother Wilson Kennedy , a former brother of Saint Cross who publicly denounced the abuses .
The collective redress must first pass the stage of admissibility in court .
Once the Court admits admissibility , we proceed to the second stage or the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first resort , the church of the Holy Crnut had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the substance .
Imposing fire in trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the LSalle region in Montreal in the night of Thursday to Friday .
Relief was called at 1.00 , on Friday , because of a fire that had declared the subsoil of an Indian cooking restaurant on Dolard , near the intersection with the Ranana street .
The 30 fire brigade who were sent to the scene took almost an hour to get the brakes under control .
The fire was &apos; caused major damage to the building structure &apos; , indicated the head of the operations of the Montreal fire security service , Richard Bordeaux .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in the restaurant when the fire brigade arrived .
There have been no injuries , but almost twenty homes , located in the first and second place of this commercial side , have had to be evacuated .
The Red Cross has been requested because the residents of one of the flats may have to be temporarily temporarily temporarily mentioned .
Many opposition to medical aid to die in Congress of palliative care
The Canadian palliatives Congress , which is taking place this week in Ottawa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical aid to die in Quebec .
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to calm their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would like to end their days , according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Ppalliatives Association , Maryse Bette .
If we were to focus on palliative care in Canada , the euthanasia approach would become minimal .
The Quebec Spalliative Scare Network also rejects the draft law on medical aid to die .
If it is adopted , Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations .
&apos;What is the meaning of life &apos; ?
The majority of the palliative care houses will refuse to help patients to die , according to the Vice-Chair of the Spalliative Class House , Suzanne Fitzback .
Mrs Fitzback , who is also the head of the Mathie-Savan house in Gatineau , believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway .
We never ask : &apos; I want to die , give me an injection &apos; .
The Director of the STUC , Rik Firth , believes that the Quebec bill disorientates the population with regard to the vocation of palliative care .
He does not believe that the Ontario will follow suit .
For its part , the Liberal MEP , Stéphania Vallés , says that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Kenyan press
&apos;It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question : what will prevent Parliament from wiping out the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? &apos; , said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional .
“ This law is draconian and very punitive , and we reject it , ” explained Cyrus Kamau , the Director-General of Capital Group – the owner of CapittalFM , one of the most respected independent radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya .
He said that the new media court will always be one-sided because it is an extension of the government , and the restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
‘ I hope that the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the Members of Parliament ’ .
According to the newspaper The Star , the new bill will allow the government to have &quot; media media &quot; . The Standard , for its part , said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &quot; had suffered a hard blow &quot; and used the bill as &quot; draconian . &quot;
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate trade centre last September .
The Kenyan media aroused anger by the authorities by disseminating images of video cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were supposedly the luxury commercial centre .
The head of the police , David Kimaiyo , responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them , even though the convening was withdrawn as a result of an end to the media .
Under the new draft law , the media can be punishable by fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &apos; radiated &apos; or no official press accreditation .
The court also has the power to seize the goods of a offender if it has not paid its fine .
According to the Daily Nation , “ even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations . ”
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya ’ s “ animated blogosphere . ”
By reducing the media silence , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
“ No one will ever know , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at The Nation , describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life .
“ Living to themselves , politicians would put the country bankrupt , and we would get back to hunt and cool . ”
Kenyan legislators have been the target of popular anger in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the cuts made by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mighty wages of around 532 000 shillings per month tax-free , which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmacists
Laval ’ s departure from almost 10 pharmacists at the Social Health and Services Centre ( SSS ) in Laval caused a whole eel at the head of the Cite-de Health Hospital , in 2012-2013 .
As a result of multiple retirement , maternity leave or departure leave , the pharmacy department has found itself to be highly deficient in staff .
There was almost 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , along the head of the department , Gillian Beaudet .
However , the SCASS decided not to employ independent labour , which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist .
There was no use of the breakdown , explained Mrs Beaudet .
We have streamlined or reduced some of our activities within the framework of the patchwork , the time that matters .
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people &#91; residents in pharmacies &#93; to come and stay here .
There is a competition of circumstances which has led to a bad situation last year .
improvement
After this arduous period , the year 2013-2014 will be much easier for the SSS pharmacy department .
Already three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit , because the four pupils who are now in residence in Laval have also decided to remain at the employment of the SSS .
Now , it is much better , has highlighted the pharmacist .
By the end of the financial year we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns .
So this will be closed last year .
Less
However , the situation remains delicate .
Several factors , such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because there is a young middle , and many young women are employed , so with pregnancies , we almost always have three maternity leave when it goes well , she added .
In the last year , much more has been done and there is no pharmacists who are available to replace them , so it was more difficult .
The 22 years does not start his career in the cinema by the back door .
The maker Lars von Trier chose him to embody Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nypehomiac , his next film .
This pornographic drama is grounded , in eight chapters that will emerge in two parts ( 1 and 8 January 2014 ) , the erotic memories of a quadragenic quadragenaire to sex since its adolescence .
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with his eldest is striking : a silver silence , a diapitology and French origins .
Not to mention a certain sense of risk : the one that had not hesitated to put on ice paper is going to be seen in much more sulphur situations on a large screen .
An extract from Nypehomanac has raised the temperature on the Tole : Stay Martin is on the bed and in full exactment with Shia LaBeouf .
If the provocative film has asked its players to put their own house in order , it has resorted to X professionals for the most odious sex scenes , before merging all the bodies numerically : above the belt , it is the star ; it is the star .
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg , via Nicole Kidman , Lars von Trier is accustomed to pushing his accomplices in their latest backlashes , always for the better .
Stay Martin has not finished talking about it .
A Nargo-evacuated NRR room on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening , the first session of a film was suspended in Nargood NGR , as a precautionary measure , as a result of piglets at the throat of the spectators .
Immediately , the director of the establishment went to evacuate the room and warned the firemen for a suspect smell .
There are about 70 people out of the sitting .
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not been given .
Is there a joke in the tear case ?
Or an unintended incident ?
Still , the cinema leadership has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers at the bottom .
The room has been postponed and everything has gone into order .
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and customers can regain the pleasure of the images .
On the screen alone .
It is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into citrols
Taking advantage of the Hallaween day , a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in tanks , on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trutain airport .
It was when we looked at the baggage of the smugglers that drugs could be detected .
cocaine had been distributed in three cadillas which were previously deported .
Drugs were then transported to the Office of the Royal Gendarmerie of Canada ( GRC ) which took over in this investigation .
The Canada border services agency ( SAFC ) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted .
It was part of the investigation , indicated Jacqueine Robary , the SAFC spokesman .
What I can tell you is that it came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border agents at Montreal-Trutain airport have carried out 173 seizures of drugs , including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms .
In 2012 , the border service agents in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of drugs .
Air aviation
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A shipment of S-air missiles SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new aviation raid in Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz ) has not been confirmed either by Israel or Syria .
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack , aimed at this time , for solar missiles Yakhhave , delivered by Russia in Damascus .
Israeli officials did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine
The credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poora lowered the credit rating of Ukraine on Friday , challenging the capacity of the former Soviet Republic , in recession for more than a year , to meet its financial obligations .
The note of the country ’ s government debt is going to &apos; B- &apos; , falling into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative perspective , and S &amp; P sees at least one chance in three that it will be reduced by a year .
“ It is becoming less and less likely that the government ’ s strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs , explain the US agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine ’ s foreign-exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 , and that the trend will continue .
This complicates the repayment of appropriations abroad .
These reserves , to which the authorities resort massively to support the local currency , the hryvnia , collapsing , the agency is increasingly likely to devalue , thereby inflating its external debt .
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia , which accuses it of not paying a bill of $ 882 million .
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power at a time of severe tension with its Russian neighbour , which is furious about Kiev signing an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had been in the fifth quarter of a year of contraction between July and September .
Its debt , which is still relatively modest , has soared in recent years , and S &amp; P estimates it to 33.5 % of GDP , with less than 10 % before the 2008-2009 crisis .
The country , in the budget deficit , has for months been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund , which gave it a credit of USD 15.3 billion in 2010 , and for the time being only EUR 3.4 billion .
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , notably by increasing gas prices to the population .
After a new failed mission in the country , the IMF saw this week that &quot; large external financing needs &quot; were &quot; a vulnerability &quot; , while at the same time raising &quot; signs of economic improvement . &quot;
However , for the economist Oleksandr Joloud , the Centre for Political Studies , &apos; we cannot expect a short-term improvement &apos; .
&apos;There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year &apos; , with the presidential elections scheduled for 2015 , is the expert , interviewed at the AFP .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
In addition , there is the &apos; uncertainty &apos; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which Brussels is conditional on the release of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko .
&apos;Strengthening the agreement would be positive for long-term trade , but there may be negative short- and medium-term negative consequences related to the reaction of Russia &apos; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &apos; trade restrictions &apos; from Moscow .
Russia , which represents a quarter of Ukraine &apos;s exports , has warned that , in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev , it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods .
America ’ s Green Paper
Pusicians and Omnicom have said Friday that they have not received any objections from the US authorities to their merger , moving closer to the creation of the first world advertising agency .
The merger does indeed bring the second world agency , Omncom , and the third , Pusiciis .
&apos;Omniccom Group and Public Group have today announced the expiry of the deadline for examination of the previously announced merger of Puliccias Group and Omniccom , provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Andean Act of 1976 , as amended &apos; , announcing the two groups in a communiqué .
They specify that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the deadline for the UK HSR examination period and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions required for the operation of the operation .
&apos;merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and approving the shareholders of both groups &apos; .
The Congolese army
The Congolese army ( FARC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to rob the rebels from M23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda .
M23 seems to be on the verge of being beaten after being driven away from localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) that he has controlled since the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insurgency .
&apos;We shall continue with M23 and carry it out wherever it is hiding because it is criminals &apos; , told Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli , spokesperson for the FARC .
We must not allow them to reorganise themselves because they have been marching the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace back .
Those responsible for M23 have explained that they have evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrd Bissimwa , the political leader of the rebellion , said on the RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks .
The latter , according to the Ugandan mediators , took on Wednesday in Kampala between the government in Kinshasa and M23 .
Shortages are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana , the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week , as well as around Runyoni , a hill in which the rebellion of M23 came to light in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insurgents occupied Goma , mastery of North Kivu province , profiting from the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers .
The fall of Goma led to the United Nations Mission in the DRC , the world &apos;s largest in terms of staffing , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African , Malay and Tanzanian soldiers .
For its part , the FARC headquarters has been reshuffled , and the army has moved on to the offensive against M23 , changing the course of war .
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;The M23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predicted a Congolese business expert , Jose Stearns , on his blog Congo Siasta .
That would be historic – it would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa managed to fight a major insurgency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group ally in Rwanda would be in the east of the DRC .
UN experts accuse Rwanda , which is fiercely denifying it , of militarily supporting M23 , which was originally formed by former Congolese military soldiers .
British diplomacy , William Hague , invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint , announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office .
Last week Kigali referred to the possibility of military reprisals following the shells in Rwanda .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgade to welcome the entry of the FARC soldiers .
&apos;We have lived a year with M23 and we seemed unimaginable to be released by the army one day &apos; , testifies to a person in this neighbouring town of Uganda .
&apos;We lived in terror ( of M23 ) , we are traumatised &apos; , added that man .
The tests carried out by the Paster Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus were negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &apos; the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date &apos; .
Modi , this 43 year-old patient had been suspected of being reached , after returning from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed 50 deaths .
The second American oil company , Chevron , reported on Friday a drop in its quarterly benefit due to the fall in its refining margins , while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining behind the group &apos;s objectives .
Its net benefit in the third quarter has fallen to $ 4.95 billion , or $ 2.57 per action , compared to $ 5.25 billion , or $ 2.69 per year .
The analysts asked by Reuters averaged an average of $ 2.71 .
The group has produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter , rising compared to 2.52 million bones produced a year ago .
The company is aiming at 2.65 million bones for this year , with a 25 % growth in production expected by 2017 .
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia .
Due to the cost of these projects , annual investment spending has increased by $ 7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $ 36.7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of downstream activities ( including refining and chemical production ) fell from 45 % to $ 380 million .
This reduction in refining margins affects the whole sector .
As a result , Chevron ’ s main competitor , Exxon Mobil , reported on Thursday of a net net benefit , despite rising gas and oil production .
Freight of schoolliners : the complaint deemed admissible
The College of Sherbrooke ( SRRS ) has been demanding the costs of $ 150 per student from the early school year ( up to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for school pupils to two homes , a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so .
Before the changes to the last budget , no financial contribution was made .
&apos;There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested &apos; , explains Mrs Lefin .
According to her , SCARS was invited to mediation , and she asked for another time to reflect on it .
&apos;It is always better to talk about it , to talk and to find solutions &apos; , says Mrs Lefin .
The academic Commission of the College of Sherbrooke ( CSRS ) did not wish to comment .
The organisation has only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint .
Imbroglio about the closure of the topical and urgent debate
In the face of the frontloading for several months by a number of staff and several trade unions , including the GTT , the Minister for Health , Marisol Touro , decided on 10 July to &apos; disrupt the timetable for the implementation of the project , and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which cannot take place on 4 November &apos; .
An official request is made &apos; to do not run any risk to the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &apos; , but which was also intended not to hinder the election campaign in a few months &apos; time from the municipalities .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should nonetheless be effective on that date .
Even if , in the APHP , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As of 4 November , the fire brigade who held around a quarter of the 40 000 annual passages for the emergencies of the Hendel-God will all have received a sign of taking the 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of internatives .
In the Hendel-God , the internal urgencies of urgencies will leave on Monday to five internal medicine .
As for the transfer of the beds of internal medicine , it is scheduled for this month .
&apos;The reception service of the Hendel-God emergencies must be closed in the shortest possible time , and for us it is 4 November &apos; , to ensure that the chairman of the APM &apos;s Committee on Medical Medicinal Affairs ( EMS ) , which supports the management project , is unmistakable .
&apos;On 4 November , there will be no more patients brought by the fire brigades , only people coming from their own means &apos; , confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon , the medical officer of the new Hendel-God .
&apos;But we will continue to welcome patients as a matter of urgency &apos; , but he is saying that there is a permanent presence of MUR vehicles there in order to transfer serious cases .
Senior junior doctors will remain on the ground .
But it is up to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency service .
&apos;Things are gradually being done &apos; , answers Nicolas Peju , the spokesperson for the ARS for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in service terms . &apos;
&apos;The Minister lied to us or lied to him &apos; , deplores the Ukrainian doctor , Mrs Kierzek .
As a leader of the SMUR leader at the beginning of July for leading the way against the reorganisation project , he is defined as an &apos; early-warning &apos; against a &apos; cynic &apos; decision taken by the &apos; media-administrative &apos; technostructure .
&apos;They are in the process of vying and suffocating urgencies that were renovated less than five years ago &apos; , he considers .
For him , &apos; if the other Paris emergencies could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &apos; .
However , they are regularly engulfed .
For example , there are sometimes nine waiting hours for the emergencies of Laribisière .
In the ARS , it is argued that 30 &apos; dispatched &apos; patients on several sites are not in danger of representing an &apos; avalanche &apos; in other emergency services , whose human resources have also been strengthened .
In both the ARS and the APHP , we are defending the &apos; new hospital model &apos; which has already been launched since 7 October and which should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , liberal practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of a &apos; permanent healthcare &apos; .
&apos;Where are we going to be asked if people are asked to diagnose themselves &apos; , the question is , is Gérin Kierzek , who &apos; the concept of a serious emergency &apos; is &apos; dangerous &apos; and is a &apos; medical regression &apos; ?
This is going to happen as for the level of maternity .
People are not mad , they will go where there is the best offer of care .
If the Minister does not take action by Monday , we are going to change the poet , protect Christopher Prudman , doctor doctor and member of the SGT .
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list .
In Nathia Kosciusko-Morizet &apos;s team , Vincent Roger , UMP councillor in Paris and elected from the 4th rank , it is clear that &apos; even if the Paris PMP was in favour of maintaining urgencies in Hétel-God , it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you are responsible &apos; .
Anne Hidalgo , the PS candidate , again reminded France on Monday morning that she was in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark its net disagreement , emphasises Bruno Julliard , its spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy in substance , we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency ( NSA ) to put an end to the tapping on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicating an American official on Thursday .
This decision is part of the White House ’ s attempt to take up the matter in the case of NSA ’ s tapping after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden , a refugee in Russia .
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank surveillance of the World Bank has been mentioned since the start of the scandal .
Interrolled on the subject , a US administration official replied : &quot; The US does not carry out electronic surveillance of the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &quot; .
As a result of anonymity , this official did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past .
Another official told him that Barack Obama has given an order to stop these practices in the past weeks .
This instruction was given at the same time as that ending the tapping of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , the United Nations Intelligence Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday , but allowed them to continue .
The committee introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations will now set to work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , which were set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world .
Australian diplomats have played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” aimed at replacing the MDGs , which will expire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began on the eve of Rio de Janeiro .
They were in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to “ overcome national interests . ”
‘ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process for establishing universal sustainable development goals ( ODD ) , he added .
These ODDs will be based on progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the MDGs .
The security of Mozambique is growing at the same time as there are conflicts between powerful figures .
On the feet of the Scusa Machel statue , the founder President of Mozambique , in toying them , thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo for peaceful slogans in a rare public demonstration .
&apos;We want peace to return ; we want stability &apos; , said Vanessa de Sousa , Director-General of an Investment Society .
Inquiste for the future of his country , she has exchanged her working clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention of &apos; We want security &apos; in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd in the place of Independence of the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there has been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and the Reno , the worst consignments since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago .
The Reno was once a famous rebel movement , supported initially by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then South Africa ’ s apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict , but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population .
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy , as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $ 50 MDGs in the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto , Brazil , Italy , Italy , and Anadarko of the United States .
The Filimo , the ruling party , and the main political force since 1975 , and the Reno , are shifting responsibility for tensions .
The Reno says that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofaa , a traditional bastion of the Reno , on 17 October .
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the foundations of the Reno and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , and Fernando Mazanga , the spokesman for the Reno , according to the Financial Times .
The government is making it responsible for triggering conflicts and accusing it of attacking soldiers .
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimise concerns about instability .
Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday to the AFP , the French press agency , that Mr Dhlakama regarded himself as a &apos; loser &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions in government &apos; .
The Filimo and the Reno insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern was growing after Mr Mazanga said that the Reno is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Filimo .
“ We want to resume the negotiations , but with the utmost seriousness , ” Mr Mazanga said .
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year .
“ They are two great men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) , who do not stop arguing , ” explained Joseph Hannon , a confer of Mozambique ’ s open and specialist university .
None of them knows well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
The Reno , which is in favour of electoral reform , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year .
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war on the part of the government .
The share of the Renewed votes has been falling since 1992 , while a new party , the Mozambique Democratic Movement ( MDM ) , which was created by a former Reno member , should obtain more votes in the elections .
Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&apos;He does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency &apos; , said Mr Maazanga .
We do not know exactly what the Reno &apos;s capacity is , but it has led to shaky attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway route .
Most of the consignments took place in the province of Sofaa , which is located several hundred kilometres in the north of Maputo , but where Beira is located , where mining companies , including Rio Tinto and Vale , export coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Reno threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Mazanga was somewhat timid when he asked whether the Reno would return to this threat .
The Reno wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , ” Mr Mazanga said .
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government , declares Fernando Lima , Director of Medicacoop , an independent media society , and many people are also concerned about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings .
“ People believe that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the President , and that it is up to him to find solutions to the problems , ” he explained .
Omar Sultuane , a demonstration , said that people only wanted stability .
“ No one cares about the Reno or the Filimo , they just want to return to peace , they want free access to the roads , ” he added .
We should be teaching the myths and legends of children as &apos; lifestyle models &apos; , says the author .
Thor ’ s Lérence could show that “ the brutal force does not carry the weight of subtle ruins , ” while the Arthurans reveal the importance of having a dream .
To say that many myths would be “ far too violent , far too scandalous , and in some cases far too obscure to be taught at school , ” Crosay-Holland advocated “ careful selection ” of works adapted to age .
“ I find it wonderful that in America , myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
I have been advocating this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “ openly didactic ” means that children “ completely cross ” , with messages being “ sublied ” in pleasant stories .
Croat Holland , which translates Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Fok Tales , said : “ You may have good intentions , but you want to keep them out of sight . ”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything should be simplified or end well , but there is an unborn sense of good and evil .
And it must be sublied ; revealed through history rather than declared .
The basis for what is being demonstrated and not said .
A fighter of the Hamas armed branch was killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli shoot in the Gaza Strip , learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a shells from an Israeli Israeli armchair .
NSA : The US has gone too far .
The US has sometimes gone &apos; too far &apos; in spying , recognised Secretary of State John Kerry , in this first Washington admission to Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
After ten days of scandal , revelations and denials between the US and its European allies , this is the first time that a US government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA interception of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;In some cases , I concede to you , as the President has done , some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to make sure that this does not happen in the future &apos; , said John Kerry at a conference in London that he attended from Washington on Thursday 31 October by video .
In his speech back , in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague , the head of US diplomacy gave a great deal of justification to intelligence and information collection practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks .
Invoting the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005 , John Kerry ensured that the US authorities had since stripped numerous terrorist attacks , thanks to communications interception and information collection .
&apos;We have made it impossible for aircraft to fall , for buildings to explode and for people to be murdered , because we were able to be informed in advance of these projects &apos; , argued the boss of American diplomacy .
And , as John Kerry said to Europeans , &apos; I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been misled &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;And yes , in some cases , it went too far too far &apos; , still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured us on Thursday evening that President Obama was &apos; resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that nobody feels deceived &apos; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to soar this week with new revelations in the press .
According to the Washington Post , the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo .
The newspaper , which quotes documents from the former consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden , states that the programme known as &apos; MUSCULAR &apos; , and led with the British counterpart of the NSA , GCHQ , allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibre used by Internet giants .
According to one of the documents , some 181 million elements were collected in the last month of January , ranging from meals to e-mails , elements of text or audio or video documents .
These interceptions would take place outside the US .
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , and Italy have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted a massive intercept of data and communications from US allies and leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states , while leaks in the US press claimed that the US President was not aware of such listened , Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject , invoking national security .
By contrast , the boss of the powerful NSA , General Keith Alexander , denied him that his intelligence agency captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that would have taken up these communications before providing them with the NSA .
This would be about &apos; military operations &apos; in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the United States , and that would definitely not be in Europe , and said General Alexander .
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia has convened the Australian Ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also caused China to be heard .
The Paris Saint Geg will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset , the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic , who is injured , announces the League of League in a communiqué .
The PSG , the leader of the championship in Monaco with the difference of purpose , spread the list of players who were detained for this 12th day match , without the attack of 32 years .
The communiqué simply says that he is &apos; injured &apos; , without specifying the nature of the injury .
However , he was suffering from an inflamation of the left of the left when he returned , at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony
The Father &apos;s crematorium organises , at 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the demarcated demarches in his establishment during the year .
Anne Hidalgo , a Socialist candidate in the Paris City , must attend , and then , at a press conference , she will explain her proposals for funeral .
To follow the ceremony , clicking above .
For their own darkness , more and more French people choose cream , rather than humination : 53 % , according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people , instead of 47 % .
But the opposite is the case : the French prefer inhumation ( 53 % versus 47 % ) .
If they have the misfortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book , the Mort in the ashes , Damante Le Guay , the philosopher and vice-chairman of the National Committee of Ethnic Ethics , insists on the &apos; violence &apos; of the creation , for the survivors .
There is , with the creed , &apos; violence against the loved body &apos; , which is going to be &apos; reduced to a lot of ash &apos; in a very short time , not after a process of decay , which &apos; would accompany the phases of mourning &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which is based on the &apos; erasing of the singular and distinctive signs &apos; reduced to the &apos; anonymity &apos; of the ash .
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries ?
&apos;Because the creation is a new fact &apos; , Marie-Frérique Bacé , chairwoman of the thanatology Society and the Book of Book of Book Appeal .
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to apportion it .
To call for the creation is for François Michod-Nérard , Director General of the funeral Services of the City of Paris , to provide for the defunct of a ceremony as worthy as the one he would be entitled to .
The Ipsos annual survey shows a strong commitment to organising the ceremony .
77 % of the French want one , for their loved ones , be religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of those who have chosen a creator want a ceremony .
66 % of atheists or non-believers want it .
The crematoriums have adapted to this development in society .
&apos;For ten years , they have been trying to avoid the violence of a wait for families , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the surrender of the ash &apos; , observed Mr Michod-Nérard .
70 % of the institutions now offer ceremonial masters , who carry out , in the presence of the body , the following ritual : to host the assembly , to name the defunct , to link it to others , to talk about it , to give meaning to its death and to organise the farewell .
This is the case with the crematorium of the Late Lascise , since 1998 .
The masters of ceremony are often people who have reconverted .
There are also former Catholic priests .
It is in this context that the Father &apos;s crematorium has been organising , since 2010 , the day of the Tousaint , several ceremonies of memory , secular and non-religious , to which he invites the families of the people who have been set up in the year .
For the second consecutive year , one of these ceremonies is passed on to those who cannot travel .
The crematorium has allowed us to take it up .
In the Seyne , for reasons of raids
At the beginning of the week , a family left its apartment on the ground of the Frutior D2 building , because of the presence of rats .
In view of the urgency of the situation , the Director of the South Habitat Office , the director of the South Habitat office , has proposed , exceptionally and temporarily , that the couple and three children be relocated in a T4 .
Yet the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons &apos; and the situation is blocked .
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions , estimates Jol Canapa , the head of the office .
There have always been rats , there has always been in the cities .
The corporation company is carrying out two passages per year and , in addition , we are dealing with every request from the inhabitants .
We have made 64 speeches since the end of last winter .
The neighborhood is not left behind , and the rays do not spill over into the city .
For reasons of the protection of the environment and public health , the proceeds of density are four times less efficient than in the past , certainly , but for two rats we are not going to kill a goose .
&apos;We did not get the rats at home &apos; , defend the father of the family who left his house to settle for the hotel .
We are soon without a slack and we are waiting for a new housing , at the same tariff as the old one .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics .
The Cote has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen , which is detrimental to exporting values and the warning about its annual outcome launched by Sony on Thursday .
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points ( 0.88 % ) to 14 201.57 and Topix yielded 11.23 points ( 0.94 % ) to 1 183.03 .
Sony fell by more than 11 % to 1 668 .
A house prey
A fire that started on Friday lunchtime in the Queen Quebec was quickly controlled .
More than 30 firefighters were sent to 9 from the Hebrert street .
The flames have declared themselves in a home of three houses in four floor areas behind the Quebec court .
All tenants were absent from the fire .
The fire was mapped out an hour after the arrival of the fire brigade , many of whom were speaking .
As soon as our first firefighters arrived , they really saw the apparent smoke .
&apos;So the alarms have succeeded , because it took the building to attack the building , because it was buildings coloured here &apos; , explained France , the spokesman for the fire-fighters in Quebec .
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire .

It might be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the device of the voudle Frank Fay , who held the role of ceremony leader in the Palace Theator , on Broadway , began to tell the public directly about the tone of the conversation .
Fay ’ s innovation has continued over the years , until the New York Festily Festival has been resumed more recently .
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch , the founder of the Carolines standard club , the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and large theatres .
“ Most of the heads of poster have emerged in Carolines , and have had great success , until they become too famous to play in a club , ” said Hirsch .
We have created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them .
This year &apos;s event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes , Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of &apos; Stand Up for Heres &apos; , a evening of comedy and music to the former combatants , who are organised in the Madison Square Garden , to whom , among others , Bruce Spreingsteen , Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby .
The festival has grown , as has the world of the comedive .
Several of the comedians participating in this year &apos;s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits , for example by showing spectacles on small television channels , such as Comedy Central , FX and Spike .
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the scene in a tascom on a cable chain ( “ The League ” on the subject of the joyfully lacy FXX fantasy ) and now has his own spectacle of sketchs on Central Central .
Jeny Slate took part in the “ Sura Night Live ” programme and was part of the “ Parks and Recreation ” series , but she is more known for his series of vibral videos “ Marcel the Shell with Shoes . ”
Kroll and Slate , as well as other young comedians to the singular vote ( the surreal pessimism Anthony Jeselnik , the irony of racial justice in the United Kamu Bell ) , are purses of the decentralized world of the American comedy .
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview : David Steinberg discussing with Larry David .
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedy , but he has become a film and television film maker , as well as an unofficial historian of the comedie .
Between 2005 and 2007 , he encapsulated a TV Land program that called “ Sit Down Comedy ” David Steinberg .
The meeting takes place at the Hotel de Ville in the centre of Manhattan .
“ The city is definitively in the comic DNA of all the work of Larry , ” said Steinberg .
He told me that , when he was here , sometimes he descended into a ruil between two buildings and said , if I lose all my money , perhaps I will live here .
Oil prices
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday , while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that China ’ s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is being strengthened .
The price of the US benchmark for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $ 96.24 per barrel in Europe in electronic exchange on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX ) .
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday , leaving it with a 5.8 % drop in October .
The abundant supply of crude oil has been on the price in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy indicated on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels .
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China ’ s economic recovery could continue to grow after growth rose to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the last quarter .
Gross Brent , a reference to international crude oil already used by US refineries , has lost 26 cents to fall to $ 108.58 per barrel on International Exchange Exchange in London .
Limiting the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal restored certain restrictions on the voluntary termination of pregnancy which had been blocked by a first-instance judge this week .
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that state and calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will be practising IVG will have to have an &apos; admission privilege &apos; to local hospitals .
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , under his status as a caretaker member of a hospital , to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment .
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics , because these clinics have failed to obtain this &quot; admission privilege &quot; for their practitioners .
In total , it would be about 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments .
On Monday , a judge of first instance estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions on the admission privilege were unconstitutional .
But the Attorney General of Texas , the Republican , Greg Abbott , who is the governor of governor , asked the Court of Appeal to cancel the first-instance judgment that blocked law enforcement .
A plenary session on this issue is scheduled for January .
The New Star succeeded in a return in force , side by side , with 1.3 million viewers behind their television post , or 5.6 % of audience .
But was the spectacle at the meeting ?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season , to face the jury : Marane , the Sincer , the performer of André Manoukian and Olivier Bas .
On Twitter , viewers shared their comments .
Many were disappointed by the excitement to return to their favourite agenda .
But why so much disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As every year , the first broadcasts of hearing include a broad choice of weeds , for the better and sometimes for the worse .
Yet , on Twitter , we want spectacle , emotion , originality , music ...
Fortunately , some of them have found them .
Many of them have tried the New Star , and sometimes even went to the end .
Behind the television screens , there is still a successful song voter , season after season .
Others have just the ambition to laugh .
The Court blocked a decision on the NYPD &apos;s control and search policy
A Federal Court of Appeal blocked a judge ’ s decision on Thursday demanding changes in the control and search programme of the New York Police Department and drew it up .
The US Court of Appeal ( second circuit ) has indicated that Judge Shira Scheelin &apos;s decision was suspended until the city &apos;s appeal was taken .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens .
The city has appealed to its conclusions and corrective orders , including a decision to allocate a controller to help the police department change its policy and the associated training programme .
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the request for suspension on Tuesday .
The Court of Appeal has stated that the judge should be drawn from the dossier because it infringed the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of a biased approach , partly because of a series of discussions on the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court &apos;s criticisms .
The judge ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black men and women in their control and search programmes .
It has appointed an external controller to supervise the changes , including the reform of policies , training and supervision , and it has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where the greatest number of checks are carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the city &apos;s appeal should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The control and search tactics have been criticised by many defenders of civil rights .
This system of control and searches has been in place for decades in some form , but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg , in order to achieve its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly related to black and white men .
Judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Those who advocate changes in the NYPD ’ s control and search programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices , make it possible to have more effective and trusting police forces , and to change the way in which police departments use policy .
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime , would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police forces were severely reduced over the last decade .
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but that it reformed the way in which the NYPD implemented its controls .
The tenants have to vote , because each of them pays on average $ 100 a month on the price of housing that goes to the Ville .
When the owner pays $ 5,000 in municipal taxes , he divides that amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes .
In voting , we are sending a clear message .
We need to change things to the Ville .
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay fireworks to $ 100 000 , land of $ 4 to 5 million , if ...
Go to vote , that is the best way to speak and say that it is enough .
Elysée
Shorted in the 500 m2 of elysean kitchens as committed after working in embassies , the cook has climbed all the ladder to the head , nine years ago .
He served six French presidents , from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy , including in their holiday places , and fed an incalculable number of large parts of the world in a quasi-anonymity that he is only now facing , at the age of 60 .
The man with open face , unsolicited , and intellectual , born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferte-Saint Aubin , is the holder of a PR .
His mother was cooking herself in a castle of Sologna .
&apos;I have gone from a castle to the other ! &apos; , ironise Bernard Vaugel , who is familiar not only with the bikes of the six presidents for whom he has officer , but also from their wives and some of their guests .
&apos;It is always the head of the state or his or her companion or wife who chooses the menu &apos; .
&apos;Mrs Chirac was a little more involved , she came directly into kitchen &apos; , to the point that she banned women in the Elysée kills !
Believing the heads of state with relative indifference to land feeds , &apos; they are all greedy &apos; , denounces Bernard Vaures &apos; kind of words .
Jacques Chirac certainly had &apos; a slightly more developed appetite &apos; .
But , with Nicolas Sarkozy , who had removed cheese , the beds were empty !
As for François Hollande , who has restored cheese , &apos; it is someone who likes to eat &apos; and &apos; there is little that he does not like &apos; .
The current head of state , who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign , has “ no demand for specific arrangements . ”
Bernard Vauts also remembers the pressure on his shoulders , particularly at the state dinner in the Elysée , which is to be used &apos; between 200 and 250 people in an hour &apos; .
The night before is almost white .
These people would not understand if there were mistakes .
The former head of the Elysée kitchen , who took a glass on Tuesday evening with his team , family , and friends , with a chorus at heart , François Hollande came to welcome me .
He said praise .
&quot; The human side has emerged , &quot; he says .
The leader will be replaced by his deputy , Guillaume Gomz , 35 years old , who has been in the Elysée for the seventeen years .
In a house built in 1850 in Quebec
An historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in the Queen Quebec on Friday lunchtime .
The four housing buildings on the 15 of the Hebrert street were the subject of three alarms at the fire service .
The fire has been declared before , but it has been on the three shelves of the building .
France , the spokesman for the Quebec Protection Service , has made it clear that the rapid intervention of the fire brigades has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where buildings are built in a closer fashion .
The burned house had four homes , but no tenants were at the scene at the time of the fire .
The damage has been limited , even if water has caused damage .
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin , but the undermine of a criminal act has been removed by the downside .
Wall Street
Martin Scorese leaves a few images of his next film , whose headline , that of an ambitious New York broker , is embodied by Leonardo DiCasprio .
Forget to be reasonable and leave your notes .
Leonardo Digprio is going to see you in his role as a lunch trick .
Martin Scorese is telling us the real story of a &apos; Long Island Long Island &apos; , which refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a huge corruption case on Wall Street .
In the 1980 ’ s , Jordan Belfort was a snap that will make him a rich , rich man .
The opportunity to follow its unbelievable rise , but also the staggering fall .
Without limits , the man is encountering festivities , women and drugs .
Success and excesses of all kinds are the words of this insane history .
The Scorese-Didiprio couple seems to have found the magic of the magic of the magic in Shutter Island .
The way out of the new Scorese has been delayed because of its too long monster .
It would appear that the film lasts at 2.45 p.m.
In the Chamber on 25 December , he will be able to play a fair part in the coaches race .
The Coulon used the telephone piracy to check a tumult .
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used “ Internet piracy , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a bidon tumult on a link involving the then Interior Minister , Charles Clarke .
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the tribunal of the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pwlby , his “ fine special adviser . ”
It was pointed out to the court that the newspaper responsible for Glenn Mulcaire , a private device , hacked into Pwleby &apos;s voice box and &apos; constantly ploughing him in his own doorstep &apos; , but Coulson also called it and left voice messages .
‘ The accusation suggests that Mr Couilson , who is now the editor of NotW , is not the kind of man to stay in front of people ’ s house in the hope of surprises , it is the kind of man to love the history of the people to see what they say , Mr Edis said .
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects : telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation .
The editor is personally involved in the third .
It is obvious that he is aware of the second , supervision , that cannot be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is he aware of the piracy ?
He says otherwise , but we say &apos; of course if &apos; .
The rumours about a link involving Clarke were first taken up by the Nottong Case office when a source , having a sexual attractiveness to Miss Powby , said that she had been told : &apos; Let us not lose time with her , she is with Charles . &apos;
A gang , on which pirated voice messages were made on his phone at least three times , was seized at the house of Mulcaire in August 2006 .
Investigators have also found seizures on the computer of the private device that concerned Miss Pwlby and her conscientious sister in a “ Project ” dossier .
During the period when the device investigated it , Miss Pwby &apos;s grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked to information on her , added Mr Edis .
In the meantime , the former , Neville Thurlbeck , and the former defendant James Weaerup oversaw the monitoring of the Lille Powby &apos;s cheapest facts and gestures .
In a vote on 18 June 2005 , Mr Couyet said : &apos; I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow , which I would really like to talk about in Charles . &apos;
Mr Edit said that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as the former Minister for Home Affairs David Blunkett .
The jury was heard on Thursday that Coulson faced Mr Bunkett with regard to a link with a married woman when he was a co-defender of the co-defend Rebekah Brooks , who was also married at that time .
Couon and Brooks deny that they conspired with others to pirate telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherp admitted that they had carried out telephone piracy .
Barack Obama ’ s Prime Minister
On Friday , 1 November 2013 , the US President had to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , seeking help from the US to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities .
964 people died in the violence in October , including 855 civilians , 65 policemen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN is doing even more with 979 dead and 1 902 injured .
This violence is increasingly murderous , despite increased security measures and extensive military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki , dominated by the Shia .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1 073 people were killed .
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops , the level of violence is causing fear of a new conflagration while neighbouring Syria is in a civil war .
The bombs are hitting markets , mosques , marriages and funerals .
Men are slaughtered on the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complains that he is politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests , has encouraged this outbreak of violence .
On Friday , further violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars in the north of Baghdad .
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ( EIIL ) , a group affiliated to al-Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , also involved in the civil war in Syria .
Nouri Al Maliki wants a &quot; global war &quot; against al-Qaeda .
The violence is at the heart of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the US President , elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country , gave an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington , Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive , and the elected representatives of Congress .
On Thursday , he argued for the international community to conduct a &quot; Third World War &quot; against al-Qaeda .
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic Senators .
But the latter also criticized Nouri al-Maliki , a Shia , for giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his “ sectarian and authoritarian politics . ”
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri al-Maliki that “ Iran ’ s pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . ”
Beijing accuses an Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
The head of Chinese internal security accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists on Friday of being behind the bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in the Beijing Centre on Monday .
The vehicle , a SUV , has shouted on the crowd that was on the famous Chinese capital , a symbol of the murderous repression that took place in 1989 , and took on its three passengers and two people .
Mg Jianzhu , a member of the political office responsible for internal security issues , accused the Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack .
Many Uighurs , a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang , call this Chinese province East Turkestan .
For the Chinese Government , this movement is responsible for the frequent eruption of violence that is taking place there by demands for independence .
&apos;The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organised and premeditated &apos; , said Mg to the Mongo-konge Phoenix TV channel .
&apos;The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan &apos; , he added , his words were taken up by the new China agency .
The Chinese police identified the vehicle driver whose name suggests that he is of Uyghur origin and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained consignments of petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious entries .
The incident caused 42 injured .
The Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan is seen as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations .
The Vatican on contraception , divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey around the world about how the parcels manage sensitive issues such as contraception , divorce , and same-sex couples .
The poll asks the participants how priests care for gay couples and their children , and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by marriage links .
The poll was sent in mid-October to every national conference of bishops , with the signal of getting as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important gathering on the family which the Pope is planning next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholics Report , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that every bishop would decide the right way to think about the parosians .
In the UK , bishops published the Internet poll by asking Catholics to participate .
DRC
The intractable of M23 , some hundreds of combatants , was saturated almost 2000 metres of altitude on the farm hills of Chancellor , Runyonyi and Mbubbles , near Bunagana and Joma , two localities located around 80 km to the north of Goma , the capital of North Kivu province .
&apos;It has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continues in spite of the night &apos; , told the AFP an inhabitant of Joma , joined by the telephone at 12.30 p.m. and according to whom a girl was injured in the morning .
&apos;The intensity of clashes has fallen a little &apos; , he added , &apos; it seems that the DRC &apos;s FARC Forces have pushed the rebels back a bit &apos; .
According to this witnesses wishing to remain anonymous , the soldiers had “ spent the night ” in Jomba before moving to the front for an “ Operation Operation . ”
There was a great deal of talk behind him , which was fed up with small arms .
From Bunagana , the political fiefdoms , and the last place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday , a journalist of the AFP could hear heavy weapons detonations .
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the stabilization of the DRC , the fighting went &apos; in a final phase &apos; , with the FARC &apos; encapsulating the positions of the M23 residue to depart them &apos; .
Since the resumption , on Friday , of clashes between the Movement of 23 Mars ( M23 ) and the army , the Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting , but it provides the government troops with decisive support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , dozens of soldiers , who are well supplied with ammunition , were heading for the front line .
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers .
Earlier on , on the road to Bunagana , post border with Uganda , of the military aided by civilians was carrying out a multifaceted rocket launch on a new FARC truck , which would have to take over the M23 positions on the hills .
The Congolese President , Joseph Kabila , called on the rebels again on Wednesday evening to &apos; demobilise voluntarily &apos; or to be disarmed &apos; by force &apos; , but has left the Kampala Process open , where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing it since December without any results at present .
On the ground , the M23 political leaders are hoping to reach an agreement .
&apos;We have finished the talks , only the Ugandan mediation to organise the signature &apos; , said Roger Luumba , Vice-President of the M23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
M23 was born of a mastery in April 2012 of former rebels , mostly tutsi , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23 , which Kigali and Kampala refute .
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC , and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources .
In Bunagana , on the Ugandan side of the border , where there were around 5,000 people between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the return movement to the DRC which started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day .
&apos;This morning we went back to our fields , but the military told us to replicate &apos; , told the AFP Imelda Nyirankui , surrounded by its nine children , including a baby on the back .
It seems as if the shots are getting closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of inhabitants crossed the border , some with a matching match , to spend the night in Uganda .
The musical County
Classified , sophisticated , popular , in English or in French , the producted and danced productions take their flight .
After Broaday and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It is a revolution : French musical is affirmed as a kind of success .
In the Long Dame of Paris from Paris to Mozart the rock opera , most of the attempts would be made in ridicule .
And success stories such as Cabaret or the Mistices were a mystery to the mystery .
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Cheltelet and Stage - Entertas in Mogador has changed the situation .
Today , both scenes are coping with securities as a success story .
The first , this Christmas , takes up its excellent Mary Fair Lady and announces the global creation of &apos; an American in Paris &apos; .
In Mogador , &apos; Bon and Bast &apos; may well be one of the success stories of the season .
On the other scenes , musical spectacles such as &apos; 1789 &apos; , &apos; the Bastille ambassadors &apos; and the small musical comedires such as &apos; Proco &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are based on success and quality .
Patrick Niedo , author of the reference book &apos; History of musical comedires &apos; and confer on the Châtelet Theck , analyses the reasons for the success that has been achieved so hard .
How do French musical comedires develop ?
The supply has multiplied .
First of all , there are the &apos; musical spectacles &apos; which change at the mercy of producers ...
Some use them - beautiful images of images and a real story as in 1789 , the Basque Amants .
Others are making a leap of 15 years on the pretext that we can serve almost - whatever you have to say - Pokora at the head of poster .
After that we have the musical comeditions with the somptuous productions of Châtelu which are bringing us back to the golden age of Broaday and finding the universe of Stephen Sonheim , the largest - living composer .
It is a popularly popularary that populates Anglo-Saxon musical comedides of variety by adapting them in French .
The independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough .
However , projects under way like &apos; Rt &apos; , &apos; The Baier of Women araided &apos; or &apos; The Spring of the spring &apos; have difficulty being funded .
Do we have enough artists capable of being able to play and dance ?
In Paris , when there are eight music spectacles in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , the cradle of the musical comedive is very different .
Young people are trained in many schools .
There are many jobs between the regional theatres , tourist , Broaday , Broaday ...
The breeding ground is as high as the number of posts to be filled .
Why is the tourist in the province so successful ?
With the exception of the opera , the province remains the poor relative of culture in France .
Few pieces of theatre go on and it is often the case of a boulever for adults and not young adults .
There is a lack of musical spectacles .
It is the same young people who like reality and what it produces as ephemeral stars ...
Proposing beautiful young men ( often talented ) at the top of a musical spectacle is an assurance that these young girls , and often their entire family , will become bogged down .
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are skilfully held by professionals who answer questions .
These spectacles are very much expected when they arrive in a province of the province .
The Mayonnaise has grown in Paris and disguised by provincial provincials .
Show is designed to enter all of the major rooms in France in the same form as in Paris .
A serious injured in an accident with a shadow driver on Brussels Brussels
A road accident caused a serious wounded , on Friday morning at 5.30 p.m. , on the internal Brussels ringing to the height of Hoilaart , to Waterloo .
The car of a driver has been caught by a shadow driver who is unscathed .
The movement was closed down to 9.00 a.m. in the case of the accident , the time that the road has been cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
However , this situation has not led to traffic jams , because the accident took place at the height of the Hoilaart exit .
It has therefore been possible to move away from the exit / entry .
A seriously injured child in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on an attraction at Disneyland Paris .
Its vital prognosis is no longer committed , but it is still hospitalised .
At the time of the fall , the boy was with his father on a ship of the &apos; Pials of the Caribbean &apos; .
It has been closed up to new order .

Children are playing on a carbon blunder that belonged to the rebels in M23 , in Kimmmba , on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DRC .
On Friday , the Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the latest bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in the east of the DRC .
The aim is to remove the M23 of the hills that overshadow Bunagana .
Yesterday , we took the hill in Buina , which overshadows that of Mbubbles .
Today , Mbuzi should fall .
There will be no more than the Runyonyi hill .
Chancellor of the Council . - ( FR ) SChancellor of the Channel is not very strategic , and has indicated the AFP the Governor of North Kivu , Julink Pluku .
Mr Pluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday .
The country ’ s political leadership and the final place of the rebellion are located on the Ugandan border , about 80 km to the north of Goma .
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday .
Since then , a few hundred irrigables of M23 have been saturated to almost 2,000 metres of altitude on the farm hills of Chancellor Chanyonyi and Mbubbles , near Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Joma .
In Jomba , a person who reported that he was fighting all the time on Thursday throughout the day , said that the situation was &apos; calm since this morning &apos; .
According to him , a woman and her child were killed by the fighting on the eve and were buried .
A girl has been injured , and three other people have been injured , including an uprising , evacuated by the FARC , added this witness quoted by the AFP .
Since the resumption of the fighting between the FARC and rebels on 25 October , the two warring parties have not given any assessment of the loss of life .
NSA ’ s revelations increase the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance
By a beautiful day of late August , a German police helicopter overflying the British Constate in Frankfurt , Germany ’ s financial capital .
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( BfV ) , the German National intelligence agency , its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .
The German media explain that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antentes and that the operation provoked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James Classir , the US intelligence director , again insisted in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “ fly the industrial secrets of foreign companies on account of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ”
But , since Edward Snowden , who has become whistle-blowers , has begun to uncover his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of US surveillance , European governments and business leaders no longer know whether the director should be thinking .
Reports , according to which the US National Security Agency spy Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in the Could , notably Google and Yahoo , have more than ever aroused the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance .
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s telephones had been pirated , perhaps even for a decade , was the drop in the ocean that bore the cap .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then business leaders are surely also potential targets .
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent .
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest .
“ Germany must wake up , ” declares Oliver Grün , President of BITMi , representing German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the US is such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , according to a survey published in July by the board of advice .
However , in all the documents revealed by Mr Snowden , there is no evidence to date that the United States has passed industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies .
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Business leaders are sceptical about this .
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only turn a blind eye and reopen them slowly ...
&apos;This is not the right way to do &apos; , says Hasso Platner , the chairman of the German company software company , SAP .
If we want a strong European IT industry , then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , coal to cars and farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistication of US espionage agencies exposed by Snowden ’ s revelations were a shock to some firms that thought that China was the biggest in terms of surveillance .
A major change is taking place in the cloud computer , as European officials have become aware that data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to an investigation carried out by the Capitals Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-American members have abandoned their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the clouds following the revelations about the US program of data exploration .
Jim Snabe , co-director of SAP , says : &apos; Our customers are asking us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago : where my data are kept , and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction ?
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to fly their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage .
There have always been .
&apos;This has been a recurring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion &apos; , says Kurt Bock , Director-General of the PASF chemicals company .
The Americans are spying on us in commercial and industrial terms just as we spy on them , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place , if that leaves the advantage of an adversary .
Big companies have long been marching the message that it is at least unwise to recoup a free USB key in a professional room or leave a mobile computer without supervision in a hotel room .
Ulrich Hackenberg , a member of the Management Board of the Audi car manufacturer , says that the collection of mobile phones before the Council meetings , so that they cannot be used as a distance listening equipment , has been common practice for years .
Germany ’ s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones paid when travelling abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of smartphonies .
The mobile phones paid are then thrown out .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and supervision .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche .
‘ SMEs often lack experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorised access ’ , warn the BfV in a report .
The United States is alerting their own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries .
The United States National Intelligence ( NIE ) , carried out in February by the United States , mentioned France , as did Russia and Israel , guilty of having carried out economic intelligence acts , behind China , according to The Washington Post .
A member of a renowned German company believed that , when it comes to economic espionage , “ the French are the worst . ”
Bernard Suforcini , a former French intelligence director , the DCRI , said in an interview this month : “ The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , spy their allies . ”
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who died in unusual circumstances
The parents of a teenager in Georgia , whose body was found in a ruined carpet in the gymnase of his school , think that their son was murdered , declared the family lawyer on Thursday .
Kendrick Johnson , from Valdosta in Georgia , was found on 11 January caught up in a carpet that was backed up behind the gymnaws ’ grades of his school .
The Sheriff ’ s investigative investigators concluded that Johnson died in unsolicited circumstances , but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputes these conclusions .
“ They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacolyn Johnson , on FoxNews.com.
They never thought that he was dead as indicated in the Sheriff Conclusions .
“ They believe that this defies logic , physics and common sense , ” added Crump .
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered solely to cover the people responsible for the death of their son .
“ They sent their son to school with a carte and they were handed to a mortal bag , ” he added .
The US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he had an official investigation into the death of Johnson , pointing out that a number of important issues remained unanswered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
He spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I shall follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My aim is to discover the truth .
‘ I consider that there is a sufficient basis ’ to open an official investigation , he said .
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was deceived by “ positional suffocation . ”
However , a second authority has identified another cause of death , according to Moore .
‘ A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation ’ , he indicated .
Moore added that if he uncovered elements of a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Johnson , he would ask the FBI to conduct it .
The representative of the Sheriff of Lowounds County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday .
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video recordings that the investigators had examined .
The parents of the teenager said that they hoped that video images would contain evidence of the circumstances of his death .
The CDC publishes advice on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday , the US Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published a series of directives indicating how to deal with children &apos;s food allergies at school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publishes , since the number of children in school age with food allergies has soared .
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food allergy .
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child rose by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the professoral body and staff to child allergies and how to deal with them in the event of allergic reactions .
It also recommends that schools should have a hallmark stock – Epipen ’ s self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially lethal anaplaxia .
The legislative assemblies of the States have recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily in stock .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children with an allergic reaction .
Children can say , &apos; I have the impression that something like the language &apos; , &apos; I have the impression of having a hair on the language &apos; or &apos; I have pipes on language &apos; .
The NSA case highlights the complete absence of a debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which is on a collision basis in public when convening the US ambassador on 21 October , and on the other banning the overflying of the territory by Bolivia &apos;s presidential plane , on the basis of the rumour of the presence on board Edward Snowden ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When François Hollande phone to Barack Obama , or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told the US ambassador , they respond to a real discovery , which is the extent of US surveillance of all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the Monde columns a few weeks away from the reproduction of the US diplomatic correspondence and , on the other hand , a condemnation of the tapping of the Quai de Orsay by the NSA ?
Is it not a vague hypocrisy on your part ?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning , but the search for interest and the relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion .
When WikiLeaks lift the veil over US diplomacy &apos;s analysis of political and other issues around the world , we consider that , in view of American power , this is an important light .
When we describe US interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is in no way to be indignant about this practice , it is to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the NSA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The establishment of very powerful interception technology in the last ten years by the US , but also by France , has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Moreover , in this area , France and the United States , among other things , have put in place cooperation procedures and almost daily exchange of information and are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French with the resources of the NSA .
France can be led , for example , to pass whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services , and , as has already been said , the Americans can provide information to the French on other parts of the world .
So the underlying question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools , but the question of the complete absence of prior debate , particularly in the Parliaments , about the justification for such systems , the perimeter that must be theirs , and ultimately the issue of infringements of freedoms .
What is the real risk of the US ?
It is not clear how they can be punished .
The American risk may be twofold .
The first is when their allies – and this was the case recently – learn that their leaders , sometimes at the top of their governments , have been monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have been strained .
Another effect may be more economic : more and more European or South American companies are reluctant , in the light of the revelations , to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws , and thus to the control of NSA .
The final point is that the vast media revelations committed by media around the world , helping to start a debate on intelligence monitoring practices until then , could push legislators , including the US , to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services .
The Parents of Sexual Children
Germany became the first European nation to recognise a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
The male or female sex of the new born will no longer be attributed to birth in a rigid way .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children , allowing them to include an &apos; indefinite &apos; or &apos; unspecified &apos; sex on its birth certificate .
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could take hasty decisions on a surgery of sexual reassignment for their infants , and to combat discrimination against people who are sexually motivated .
According to the BBC , an interviewed person would have said years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”
I will remain the patchwork that doctors , contusities and balloons have created .
It is estimated that a child on 2 000 born every year is neither a boy nor a daughter .
They are interviewed , the intersexuality that forms part of the sixty of the sixty diseases diagnosed as a disorder of sexual development , a generic term designating people with chromiosomes or inflants ( ovine or female ) or abnormally developed sexual organs .
Diana Simpson could have been sexually sexualized .
Sexual identification is still not fully understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined it is better to use the best information available to attribute it , then to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act , if necessary .
Dr. Jack Dresher , psychiatrist in New York and expert on sexual identification , said that the new German law “ appears to be a good idea . ”
Sexual children pose an ethical dilemma .
‘ Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act , but that is not the case with most children ’ , he added .
Sexual assignment can be made without operation , and we can see how identity develops .
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
No one can answer the question as to why this is happening .
It is like the mystery surrounding homosexual people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the people who are interviewed as different from transgender or transgender persons , since their status is not linked to gender , but rather to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively that of a man or just that of a woman , but generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other .
These characteristics can be manifested themselves in secondary sexual characteristics ( such as muscular mass , piloting , petroleum , and stature ) , primary sexual characteristics ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of chromiosomes and hormones .
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by sexual and gender people in employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudices .
Non-compliant young boys now have camps that are specifically intended for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male , female or “ third sex ” sex on their official documents .
In June , an Australian Australian , Norrie May-Welby , became the first person in the world to have been recognised “ neutral ” after winning his appeal trial that allows him to keep a “ unspecified ” sex for life .
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersexuals , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are always controversial , according to a broadcast broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law , writing that “ since the world is dragged into a new rule in which gender is a choice , but where sexual activity is not one , two other pillars of civilisation are overturned . ”
In Maryland , the mother of a baby also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be awarded to babies at their birth .
&apos;The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without further restrictions , particularly if you do not know the sex of your child &apos; , she said on the website for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
Historically , children born without male or female sexual organs were called herumphrooke , according to the name of the beautiful Greek God who had a dual sex .
And , just over ten years ago , the medical community regarded gender as an arrow , which can be erased and which can be redrawn .
But now many people are calling into question the ethical basis of surgery , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken , knowing how a child will feel his sexual resignation when they grow up .
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , this was a psychiatric emergency , ” he said .
When these children were born , they were not called psychiatrist , they were telephone .
The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Money , the Johns-Hopkins University , who considered the gender to be malleable .
He enshrined the term “ sexual identity ” and argued that social and environmental signals – how parents raise a child – interact with a child ’ s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female .
But in a case of 1966 , known as John / Joan , his theories gave rise to controversy .
He advised the parents of a small boy whose penny had been cut off during a conspicuous circumcision to keep him entirely under the carpet , by also taking away the strangles , and bringing him up as a daughter .
“ Money presented this as a successful transition , but it was not the case , ” said Dresher .
At the age of 15 , he became a boy and married with a woman .
But he committed suicide at 38 years .
Dresher said that some doctors “ always repeat this model . ”
But in the 1990s , with the Internet coming , those who survived these sex changes say &apos; &#91; that &#93; they are not satisfied with the result &apos; .
This is the case of Jim Bruce , a 36 year-old writer in Montana , born with male chromiosomes , but ambiguous sexual organs .
Doctors could not really say whether he had a broad clique or a little penny and convinced that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
So shortly after its birth in 1976 , Bruce suffered a surgery of the external body and of the strangles and was high as a daughter .
They were given female hormones at the age of 12 .
“ I knew I was not a daughter , ” he said about ABCNews.com.
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 years he has suffered a vagoropy .
But depressed and realised that something was wrong , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horrified .
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me .
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( DDS ) that prevented its body from producing enough testosterone so that its sexual organs could develop .
Having learned the truth , he has once again become a man , according to the treatment of his tetosterone , and he has taken away the sins .
The surgery made it sterile .
Today , he is defending the cause of others in an organisation called Interface Project , which is trying to standardise the perceptions of people who are sexually motivated .
But Anne Tamar-Mattrs , the General Executive Director of the non-profit organization based in California Advocate for Informed Choice , fears that German law “ invites labelling and stigmatisation . ”
“ Many activists worry that German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and give their child an “ indefinite sex ” , she said .
We fear that it will encourage interventions .
We think it would be better to give a male or female sex and wait .
But we did not see what the law would give , so we can only move forward with assumptions .
Tamards-Mattracting said that his organisation supported Australian law , because “ it allows adults to choose to be recognised as the third sex . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type , ” she added .
German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth .
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age .
When they grow , they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a radiologist specialized in Pittsburgh mammography , whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group , has said that the German law will “ take responsibility ” for parents and children .
The daughter of Dr Baratz , Karet , was born with male chromiosomes , but suffers from a DDS known as complete insensitivity to anodrogens .
As a result of the failure of its ancillary receptors , Kdiplomacy has developed female characteristics .
It has a vagin , but no uproar or oven .
Today , the age of 29 , Karet is married and internal psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania .
Although it is sterile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or mothers .
“ The law gives parents a certain latitude so that they do not have to take hasty decisions , ” said Baratz .
This gives them time to carry out some tests and to understand them , and a deadline before they include a male or female ‘ female ’ .
So everything goes well – you can raise your child and love it .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being relative .
You do not have to rush into surgical intervention that is irreversible .
“ This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what they need , ” she said .
Finally , the child will decide with which sex he feels the / most comfortable – and that is wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for itself .
In the longevity of his government
The Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will keep up until 2015 , despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his mandate .
In a daily interview with La Stampa , the center-left leader says that he firmly intends to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015 .
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August .
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support for government if the Senate , where he has more adversaries than supporters , makes his deportation .
But part of his camp , grouped around the National Secretary of the People ’ s Freedom Party ( PDL ) Angelino Alfano , continues to support the government , as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi ’ s injunctions , which already wanted to push the cabinet down .
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Security Agency , TSA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire .
There have been fire-fighters who have said that they have responded to a call for &apos; multiple wounded &apos; .
&apos;The forces of law are on the spot &apos; , precise the airport on its Twitter account , while television pictures showed people evacuated in ambulances .
&apos;There was a shooting &apos; , told the AFP a spokesperson for the US transport safety agency ( TSA ) .
ABC &apos;s local antenna showed a person evacuated on a knuckard , and a second transported on a wheelchair .
The incident took place at 9.30 p.m. ( 12.30 p.m. in Montreal ) at the terminal 3 of the airport , also specified the airport .
The Los Angeles Times says that temachs 2 and 3 are being evacuated .
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured .
All flights to and leaving the airport have been suspended .
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member to Gaza
Israeli tanks killed an Islamist Hamas militant in Hamas on Thursday and injured another in the south of Gaza , learned from sources of health services .
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting has broken out in this region , because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and have been targeted by Palestinian brokers .
The Israeli army has only referred to a &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a &apos; terrorist &apos; tunnel by the Hebrew State , widened at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October .
Report : Obama campaign
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisors considered , in the utmost secrecy , to replace Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This revelation is the most striking event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign of Mark Halperin and John Heiln , “ Down Down : Game Charange 2012 ” .
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday evening that the President ’ s relatives had conducted “ in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see whether Biden ’ s eviction could help Obama to re-election , while his hopes fell .
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior leaders of the campaign and of the White House , namely the former Secretary-General of the White House , Bill Saley , to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded in the Chicago Base of Camgo and within the egg Bureau .
Only half a dozen close advisors of the president – including Dealy , Obama ’ s former leader , Jim Messina , and former advisers in the White House David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that change was under way .
“ Don Down ” indicates that Deey has led the burden to replace Biden , despite their “ close personal ties , ” before finally deciding on change when the figures have shown that having Clinton on the presidential list “ did not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances of success . ”
In an interview with Martin , Deey confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden by Clinton .
“ I said that I had looked at a whole range of questions , and that was one of them , ” said Deep in the newspaper .
Remember that at that time the President was not in the form , and so it was said , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos;
While Déaly called the “ concert ” examination , Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a great deal to discover whether the change would be beneficial in the election .
“ The countryside does not devote a lot of money to polls and to discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action , ” said Martin on AC360 .
However , we do not know whether Obama knew that his team was looking at replacement .
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley if his boss were aware of the possible overhaul .
Although Déaly said that he did not think that the president was aware of any change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was “ possible ” that Obama knew .
Martin added that “ Double Down ” was not a definitive answer to the question as to whether political polls had reached Obama ’ s office .
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know that Biden ’ s eviction of the presidential list was considered .
‘ Perhaps ’ , answered Martin .
Do you want a fluo ice ?
A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorescent glory in the world based on contempt .
Charlie Francis has benefited from the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a lucid collision .
He had the idea after having read a study on the meals and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate the shining protein chestnut .
The ice cream reacts with language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it brilliant .
Chris explains that , since the ice cream begins to read when it reacts to the heat of the mouthpiece , the more you stand , the more brilliant it becomes .
Charlie , the founder of the ice society ‘ Liick Me Im ’ Deliciu , said : ‘ It is an unbelievable thing , but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of that song costs around £ 200 . ’
The protein we use in ice reacts with the neutral pH language .
So when your mouthpiece hears the protein , the level of pH increases , and the ice is shining .
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Hallaween , because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
This is probably the most expensive ice that I have created , because the light of the bad weather is four times more expensive than gold .
Every single shop therefore costs me about £ 140 .
But it is rather good !
society with the experimental leadership of Charlie , based in Bristol , is known for its unusual ice perfume such as beer , cheese , beef and the gold leaf .
But its next creation will be even more ambitious .
He added : “ I really want to develop an invisible ice . ”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the fuss caused by the ice cristers that are the ice cream , but I think I will find a way to do that .
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the metaleship of Chinese scientists .
Lou Red
The songer Lou Red died when he had exercises in tai chi , revealed on Thursday the wife of Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper &apos; Easter Hampton Star &apos; and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Spres , where the couple had a house .
The artist died last Sunday , at the age of 71 .
&apos;He died on Sunday morning , when he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st movement of tai chi , with the hands of musician who filed the air &apos; , wrote Laaurie Anderson .
Lou Red was a master of the Chinese martial .
The singer &apos;s wife also explains that she promised her husband , the week before her death , that she would get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs ( Long Island ) .
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years .
Even if we are citdins , it is our spiritual home .
&apos;Lou was a prince and a fighter , and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many people the great joy of living that he had &apos; , adding .

Hallwein 2013 :
When I was small , Hallween was magic .
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , to go down late and to disguise us to go to the neighbourhood .
Today I have become more petty .
Over the last two years , I have not distributed a single bongood and I will certainly not do so this year .
But the stars show that I am the black sheep when we talk about Hallween .
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will be celebrating Hallopweu this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 trillion on bongood , disguise , and decorations , according to National Retteration Federation .
What I look forward to on every party in Hallaween is the trends .
Grants should be $ 1.2 trillion over the $ 6.9 billion spent under the NRF .
This year , unanimated objects are faltering .
Women no longer need to be professional professionals ; they can also be sexed food like pizza , hamburgers and carrots .
As far as men are concerned , I expect to see many zombies , thanks to the television series The Walking Dead , and I bet that the men of the Daft Punk space will be among our photos Instaggram this year .
According to Google , the most sought disguises are zombies , Batman , pirates , and witches .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disguised our dogs last year and , to my surprise , they were not the only ones .
In fact , the Americans are going to spend 330 M in disguise for animals this year , according to the NRF .
There are many curious dogs disguised as hoodogs .
When it comes to sweets , we do not slip .
Americans will spend $ 1.9 trillion on bongood this year , according to the Nielsen cabinet .
This represents about 272 million kg of bars Hershey , sugar , Milk Duds , Twizzlers and barres Clark .
It is a super-news for the 41 million children who go to the hunting of sweets in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Trade .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not be told , consume 41 million kg of chocolate in Hallween .
Good maize is the only thing we do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Hallween , according to the National Confliconers Association .
That is about 9 billion maize grain .
It is a mystery that I have not yet managed to clarify .
Nothing is more representative of Hallaween than Haned houses .
They carry the best names , such as “ Terr Behind the Wels ” ( who is actually a real prison ) , “ How-O-Screnam , ” and “ The Holy of Shack . ”
In fact , there are 1 200 officially recognised houses in the United States , which generate about $ 500 per revenue , according to America ’ s High Representative , and this includes these formidable photographs of you piling you over that your friends are putting on Facebook , and that you cannot abduct and on which a kind you like leaves a comment of the “ lovely head . ”
Finally , we are talking about citrols .
Charlie Brown presented us with Grose Cifilles when you were grossly gagged , and sculpsed a clandestine in the form of land , and it is like deceit a Christmas tree – that is something we have been doing ever since .
Thankfully for us , the “ bbaby of the bust ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinteris , so most of us sculed these poles and did not have to sit down .
This year , Americans will spend around $ 106 M in citrus , according to S.S. Census Bureau .
The shellfish , which are slowly drowning on the pork of your house , probably came from Illinois , where 542 million grades were grown this year .
If you seek to point out to you more , call Tim and Susan Maisdon in Napa , California , and try to sculpate their cat of 922 kg .
Royal Bank of Scotland will create a “ bad bank ” ( “ bad bank ” ) structure , bringing together $ 38 billion ( € 45 billion ) of the most risky assets , designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet in the next two years by 55 % to 70 % , and hopes to complete it completely within three years .
RBS also said that it would include a vision to depreciate additional dubious claims from four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter , a write-related writer .
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release $ 10-11 billion of capital , thereby strengthening its ability to lend .
The bank and London have stressed that the &apos; bad bank &apos; would be able to draw a line in the past , with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS .
&apos;We can now move forward , concern ourselves with the future and 90 % of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom &apos; , said the new Director-General Ross McEwan to the press .
Land Rover
There is an inner state seats and hormone belts at 6 points and an Intercom system .
One of the options is improved brakes , a service giving access to the Bowler Works mechanics , logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events .
Drew Bowler , the Director-General of Bowler Motorharport , said : &apos; The salient amateurs who join Bowler have changed . &apos;
They are not all experienced , some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events .
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA , and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to try different forms of rackeys in the United Kingdom and international , and to prepare for the riggers and realities of raids .
We had a great deal of pleasure in developing the vehicle of the Defder Challenge – the championship is really going to be palpable .
In addition , Defder Challenge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East .
The fire brigade was called to rescue a lost chip after being stuck to 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornic in a career .
Rby , a cool epol , had escaped after an unfettered road accident
It was picked up three days later by a person walking his dog stuck in the career .
The fire brigade took a back seat in order to recover the chip and save it from a certain death
A chip had the chance to escape the worst after the fire brigade was called to recover it safely when it was lost at 15 m above the ground on the unstable season of a cliff .
Rby , a 14-month cool wreck , escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday .
His owners , Scott Alderson , 25 years , and his small friend Becky Hall , 20 years , went to the career of Flasrest in Dengenme , in the West Yorkshire , to return to Ruby and thanked West Yorkshire .
They had desperately sought their lost chicken and launched an appeal on social networking sites after it disappeared into the career as a result of an unfettered accident .
Towards 14.15 on Wednesday , a caretaker person who promised his dog repented Rby on a cornuche in the career , stuck to 15 m above the ground .
A technical rescue team from the Ceckheaton fire brigade took place in the places and came back to a reminder to save Ruby by using a civic cian to transport it to the top of the cliff .
The technical aid expert Andy Clayton said : “ It was in a precarious situation . ”
She was in the middle of the cliff , 15 m of the summit and 15 .
It did not move at all during the rescue – it was frozen .
But it is right now .
She eaten biscuits after .
This was a very unusual appeal .
It is incredible that someone has noticed the dog .
The technical rescue expert Peter Lau said : “ Rby has had a great chance of getting out of it . ”
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
Rby was led by the veterinarian for control ; its general state was satisfactory , apart from exhaustion and dehydration .
Miss Hall , Halifax in the West Yorkshire , said : “ I was terrified by observing the rescue . ”
I did not think it was there first .
It was surprising to have him in arms again .
The veterinarian said that if it had been too exhausted and had evaporated , it would probably have fallen .
The fire brigade has been poignant .
What they did was really courageous .
They are so grateful , each has been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Alderson , from Keighley , added : &apos; It was feared that she would fall , but she did not move . &apos;
The fire brigade was suppressed .
I cannot believe that she was there .
Mick Jagger says that he never dreamed Katy Perry when she was 18 years old .
During an interview on Australian radio broadcasts this week , the pop star said that she was chaorist on Jagger ’ s song , “ Old Habits De Hard ” in 2004 .
Perry said that he had dinner with the rock of rock and explained , “ he drained me when I was 18 . ”
She added , “ It was a long time ago , and he was very kind . ”
In a statement on Thursday , a representative of Jagger , 70 years ago , said that he &apos; categorically denies having made advances in Katy Perry &apos; .
The representative added : &apos; Perhaps she confuses it with someone else . &apos;
Perry was one of the songs to appear during the Rolling Stones tour this year .
His new almm , “ Prism , ” landed in the first place this week .
Beijing ’ s Dangerous Islamic Movement
“ behind the scenes to the attack was the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan , based in Central and Western Asia , ” declared the patron of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television channel , according to a video online online on a website on a website .
Mg Jianzhu , a member of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , spoke in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a special organisation after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three Uighurs of the same family of Xinjiang , the border of several Central Asian countries , have precipitated their car with gasoline shells against the entry of the banned City into Beijing , in a suicide attack that killed two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and his mother died in the car fire .
The Etim , which declares itself to fight for the independence of East Turkestan , a former name of China ’ s Xinjiang , was classified by the UN in 2002 as the affiliated Al-Qaeda organisations .
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorder in Xinjiang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George Keevan : Europe ’ s break-up gives the Scots
Another worrying story of independence .
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to be able to join the EU .
Now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadnothing wall .
While it is true that the newspaper newspaper in Strausclyde has indicated the possible economic fallout from greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it was not in the headlines ( and it was to be expected ) .
No one has said that the EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from Scots .
So it is a story that is not one .
And a story so old that it is now fixed : I heard for the first time the bobbard that &apos; independence means passport control &apos; more than 40 years ago .
However , an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dust .
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe &apos;s instructions , in fact ?
Why exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels , especially now ?
This is the real news about Europe : the great post-war plan to unify Europe is permanently at a standstill .
With the euro crisis , the European Project is officially dead .
Across Europe , parties that oppose the EU or are campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany , founded only this year and arrived at nowhere , brought together almost five million votes in September ’ s federal elections and lifted the Liberal Democratic Party ( equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the straitjacket on national economies through joining the single currency , has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece .
Instead , the European system has put its members of the exchange rate in favour of German exporters – something that German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the southern European countries find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem with Germany .
The only recourse is to make cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe .
Following the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidizing French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States .
This is a downright drawback in terms of costs , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .
Not all wage wages in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap US shale gas .
As a result , the revolt revolt , particularly in France , is one of the great EU leaders .
After the war , the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy unwashed .
As a result , Marine Le Pen ’ s far-right right-wing party , the anti-European National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , sending the Socialists to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing split will automatically promote the left .
What is Mariine Le Pen doing with her new popularity with the French white class ?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single , anti-European bloc in the European Parliament .
If anti-European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will return to something that will resemble the “ Europe of the United Nations ( sovereign ) ” privileged by General de Gaulle .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency .
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project , and I hope that it will give the United States a soft eyes .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe .
Otherwise , we should imitate Norway and retain our economic independence .
Scotland ’ s SNP government is – and this is worth noting – the anti-austerity political movement that has been most successful in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed cuts ( and implemented ) by the Labour Chancellor , Allistar Darling , and the subsequent conservative / Liberal Democrats .
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
Early Emerging :
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls .
Physical changes do not mean that the puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty .
The trend towards an early puberty
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist journalist in family and child health issues .
Should a mother worry if her daughter ’ s sins and pools are beginning to grow to 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatics that took place this week in Orlando , Florida , Dr Paul Kapleowitz , child endocrine , explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard .
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general , this does not indicate a rapid move towards full puberty , ” said Kapleowitz .
The obvious signs of development , such as the bourgeoisation of the seiners , the poles under arms and the pubic area and bodily oders , appear in girls earlier .
But there has been only a slight advance of the age of the first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , when it was 12 years in 1970 .
“ Once the chorus began to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear , ” indicated Kapleowitz , also the author of “ Eary Puberty in Girls : The Esrenal Guide to Com with Tis Common Protam . ”
Time is the most accurate test of how the pubery will develop .
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of the puberty , but it is considered to be &apos; early &apos; when the development of the petch is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development slows or stops – something that a paediatrician can follow closely .
A faster development can justify tests carried out by an endocrine to remove serious problems like tumors or kysts .
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : premature ageing of those which can curb growth and a small size of adulthood .
The recommendations on medicinal and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .
The psychosocial aspects are also important .
Kaplowitz is cautious with medicines , but recognises that “ control of puberty can mitigate some of the problems of behaviour and sensational treatment of girls from different others . ”
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
“ They fear the risk of pregnancy , or even how they are going to deal with hygiene issues , ” said Kafowitz .
“ It was a shock , ” reminiscent of a woman whose daughter had its first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , it was not emotionally prepared .
It came from the frightened and shocked school to be the first among its friends .
There are many theories made to public knowledge about the causes of the early childcare .
Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages from the media are responsible .
The boys , such as girls , reach their homes sooner .
Kapleowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He took part in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9 , which links the percentage of fat with the outbreak of pubberty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
At a global level , the mechanisms of the early puberty seem to be influenced by everything , economic conditions for the climate , via genes .
Another problem is that , while boys have poles on their faces and in the younger purian area , the trend towards a real early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls .
Other doctors at the APA conference have stressed the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the acid and the pile is common , even in infants and small ones .
“ We have to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of the puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a child endocrine working in the hospital for children Goryeb in Morristoown in New Jersey .
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatrics to know how to speak with their children .
“ This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected , ” explained Kaplowitz .
If you remain calm , your child will react well in general .
daughters whose pubery is early must be reassured that , even when it happens earlier than expected , the process is part of life .
The Case of Beas
&apos; Inside Llewyn Davis &apos; of the Coen brothers , the Grand Price of the last Fannes Festival , is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the mad music that was just starting to raise it before Bob Dylan arrived .
Joel and Ethan Coen , whose filmography has just been subject to a retrospective to the French five , had brought the golden Palen to Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink .
If Dylan or the Trio Peter , Paul and Mary , Joel and Ethan Coen were not to be hired on the rising stars of the American film , Oscar Isaac , 33 years , but also on the world star pop Justin Timberlake .
In his humorous film of humour in which music is a central figure and interpreted songs , Oscar Isaac has shown a musician and a song accomplished , while Timberlake , his friend in the film , leaves the pop for mad music with contagious contagion .
As for Carey Mulligan , she left the rich Aisry Mullilian in “ Gatsby the wonderful ” for less relaxed clothes , a soft voice when she sank , but the script of the moon when she speaks .
The &apos; Inside Llewyn Davis &apos; tells a week about the tribes of a mad singer who is not going to lose and flies with the whole world .
It accepts the replacements at the foot of the studios .
Without housing , he is turning the cane of his friends who still want to receive it .
documentary air
&apos;His relationship with success is tortured ; that is what we are interested in : a mixture of bad luck , a garden which is not here at the right time , which is not a careers but which integrates , with self-destructive behaviour &apos; , told the press Ethan Coen , crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and Cannes .
If Llewyn Davis did not exist , the two fans of mad music built their history on real personalities at the time such as the mad Dave Von Ronk .
The idea was to show the moment before Greenwich &apos;s rise , that New York neighborhood called to become &quot; the epicentre of the rise of mad music , which would generate international stars &quot; as the journalist Elijh Wald , a friend of Van Ronk , wrote .
The film then takes documentary batches , the dusty music label invaded 33T invented habez by an old , unpayable secretary , the musical choices of the day , and the cafés where the singers came .
The Cooperative brothers are still working with a strange character of character who is going through the film permanently : a magnificent round in the crack of Llewyn Davis .
Asked on the way he made his character , the actor and singer Jutin Timberlake recalled that he had &apos; grown up in the Tennessee , baked by the blights and the colours &apos; .
&apos;My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guise &apos; , he said .
For Justn Timberlake , if work is needed for &apos; being considered good &apos; , &apos; chance may also start someone &apos;s career &apos; , and &apos; more and more today &apos; .
Like Llewyn Davis , who refuses to compromise on his music , the pop is saying that in a career , &apos; the most important thing is not to allow ourselves to be stuck with everything that can prevent us from speaking &apos; .
Gérard de Villiers , the author of &apos; SAS &apos; , is dead .
He will never have known the word retirement .
The Phare of the French edition , Gérard de Villiers , died on Thursday at 83 years , had just published its 200th SAS , &apos; The Kremlin &apos; s Vice &apos; .
In February , the New York Times devoted it as &apos; the novel-broker author who knew too much &apos; .
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan , the theatre of the 198 and 1994 opus of the famous series of spying novels .
Sphysically by a very serious heart accident in December 2010 , he was moving during that journey with a delight .
And before Afghanistan , he was also in Libya , Russia , Lebanon , and Mali .
With four SAS published a year , Gérard de Villiers , born on 8 December 1929 in Paris , ensured that the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of &apos; SAS in Istanbul &apos; , the first of the series nearly a half-century ago , was ignored .
&quot; Without doubt , between 120 and 150 million countries , &quot; he said last March .
His Burmese cat on the knees , in the height of his immense apartment of a novel Fish building to two steps from the Arc de Triore Arc , the malign eye under his white horses , he mentioned some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated : Italian , German , Russian , Greek , Japanese or Korean .
“ Without counting the pirate editions , ” he said , naming pounds of pounds on the low table between bronzes or the covets of the 130 ardent countries to place their noses there .
For the price of a cigarette packet , the reader has the right to traditional cover with the photograph of a young woman at the favorite chorus , wearing a gun or a gun gun .
Internally , his secular altitude ( SAS ) Prince Malko Lingge , Austrian aristocrat , and contract agent to pay for the reparations of the house of the family , spearhead the woes of the land , the communists of the 1970 ’ s , and 1980 ’ s , and then jihadists from the 1990 ’ s .
In every book , the same recipe : a great dose of geopolitics and exotism , a few sex scenes , a zeal of violence and torture .
&apos;I never had the claim to be a literary author &apos; , explained Gérard de Villiers .
I see myself as one who writes to distract people from whom I do not send a message .
He worked &apos; like the major pre-war reporters , the Albert London , who went there and went back with real and long investigations &apos; .
SAS &apos;s father said &apos; to make a kind of geopolitical soap &apos; .
&apos;I am constantly on my dossiers ( Afghanistan , Syria , ... ) before leaving &apos; , adding Gérard de Villiers .
On the ground , I meet journalists , including those of the AFP , diplomats , people of services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years .
As a result , many of its SAS are often prevalent : a month before a command centre of the Syrian regime killed several senior officials , he reported history in the “ Chemin of Damascus . ”
In the &apos; Benghazi &apos; , he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in that city , the cradle of the Libyan uprising .
In 1980 , he set up the murder of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in &apos; The Cairo plot &apos; , a year before the attack .
In October 2012 , in “ Panic in Bamako , ” he reported the E4X4 columns of jihadists based on the Malian capital .
I am not a citizen , defended Gérard de Villiers , I am simply hypotheses from countries that I know well and , from time to time , some of my assumptions are realised .
After these trips in often troubled areas , he set up for a month behind his machine to write IBM to Margusite , dating back to 1976 , when all parts were changed .
300 pages later , he wrote the word FIN and corrected every page in pen .
The walls of his office are clouded by AK-47 assault guns , erotic photographs and the author &apos;s photos with African warlords .
Believe for machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organisations , Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences .
Some women are sexual objects in my books , but others are beautiful , intelligent and courageous women .
I am always well received in Africa , where I have many readers .
Gérard de Villiers said : &apos; Malko Lge , like all heroes , does not have an age &apos; .
He will not die and retire .
Neither I nor myself .
There is a quarrel about the width of seats when large orders are at stake .
The dispute is raging between the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the seats of the tourist class on long-distance flights , paving the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dubai aeronaux , which is taking place in the month .
The conflict is about the width of seats on long-distance flights to economic class passengers – which are not always the most crowded by airlines , but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus and Boeing Co .
This week , Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 hens ( 45.72 cm ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Boeing says that it should be up to airlines to decide .
The dispute has erupted when the avioners seek to sell even larger versions of their long-run long-run aircraft , hoping that they may have a record record in the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November .
The way in which seats are ready to go back – in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats head on – is essential for the economic performance of the “ mini-jummo ” segment .
Boeing says that its “ 777X ” redesigned will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats of more than 17 hens , and will be configurated with 10 per row seats .
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in the seats of 18 hens of large entrants in line with 9 .
The aeronautics often trade with technical questions by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus is calling directly to the public before the Dubai aeronaux , where 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We have recently seen what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against one another in the restaurant , entitled “ Do you accept that ? ”
&apos;Boeing proposes long-distance flights to seats in smaller seats than in regional turbolassers &apos; , has indicated John Leahy , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people grow , but the seats in aircraft have not changed radically .
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the jumbo 747 of Boeing defined modern long-mail travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American of 40-49 years rose by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .
In the twenty-first century , the size of the average American is 39.7 hens , according to US health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival is clinging to a concept of siege that dates back to the 1950 ’ s , when the newly-named “ jet jet ” movement was closer .
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional lump in the width of seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53 % .
Boeing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures with regard to the width of seats and says that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment .
It also says that the study shows that experience in cabin is not only dependent on the width of seats .
&apos;It really is a matter of providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , said Kent Cruer , in charge of passenger satisfaction in Boeing .
They do not want them to be told what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more about having freedom of movement , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 trillion at the price of the market in decades to come , enough to shift the balance of US and European exports .
As Reuters said for the first time in July , the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last aircraft .
Airbus and Boeing both claim a return on their own in their latest patterns of long-run cooters 20 % higher than the market leader in this segment , Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats .
The performance announced by Boeing depends partly on the comparison between 777x configurated with 10 per consecutive seats and a 777 of Origin of Origin .
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the configurated device with 10 seats per row currently in service .
&apos;Boeing is doing this in order to be able to fill more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products &apos; , said Kevin Keniston , the head of Confort Passer in the European Airbus aviator .
On the other hand , analysts say that the cabin booths with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more dense configuration , which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs .
&apos;A sample of 18 hens would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , Airbus &apos;s proposal is motivated by the threat of 777 &apos; , declared the internal expert of cabin Kirby , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers , including airlines .
The vendors of aircraft who are around the world even have a metre in order to check competing configurations .
While selling itself to offer comfortable aircraft , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with densely density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel .
Airbus offers an A350 configuration with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus pointed out the need for greater personalisation of cabins by offering larger seats on a number of its aircraft .
Without the support of the other major manufacturer of modern large appliances , experts say that it is unlikely that its appeal to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats will be successful , but that it could forget the sales wave of 777X .
The shareholders of Oracle
A majority of US shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposed remuneration for the founder and Director General Larry Ellison , given his group ’ s financial performance .
The vote is not binding , but it is a testament to the image of Larry Ellison , the third world fortune , just as just as the victory of his ship in the American Cup has just begun .
The billionaire still holds 25 % of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago .
As long ago as last year , Elbert had a negative vote on his pay .
Oracle ’ s boss relinquished a $ 1.2 million bonus for the financial year 2013 in May , owing to the group ’ s poor performance , which lacked its growth targets , but received around $ 77 million in stock options .
Its fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar .
Out of the entire 2013 financial year , the net benefit of Oracle grew by 3.5 % , while the stock market stock rate of 27.5 % , overperforming the S &amp; P 500 index , which took 24 % at the same time .
The New Scoreboard
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction .
Other tests are necessary before we begin the tests on human beings , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College of New York has said that the first signs are encouraging .
‘ We very much hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhausting all the methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches , has said Professor Cornell .
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies .
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then begins to produce a regular stream of antibodies .
The antibodies trade all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine .
When the tests were carried out , the mouse mouse , which was then given nicotine , continued to operate normally .
But the mouse who had not been vaccinated “ were appeased ” said the researchers , a sign that nicotine had reached their brain .
Experiments are described in the journal Science TransLatin Medicine .
Previous vaccines against tobacco have proved ineffective because they contained antibodies .
The injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibodies remain high that they were too expensive and inconvenient .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns the liver cells into antibodies .
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe , it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nicotine .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
“ They will know that if they start smoking they will not be happy with the anti-nicotine vaccine , and that can help them to lose their bad habit , ” he added .
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have indicated that much more thorough research is needed .
The head of the Pakistani Taliban
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , Hakimullah Mehsouth , was killed in an American drone strike on Friday in Pakistan .
The death of Hakimullah Mehsouth has been announced several times in the past .
But intelligence officials , the army , and the activist have claimed this time that they have lost their lives in this strike , conducted in the North Waziristan region .
&apos;We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsouth was killed in a drone drone &apos; .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , travelling to London , informed the British Government that talks had been held with the Tehrik in Pakistan ( TTP ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tripoldi denies
The former Labour Minister of New Wales in the South Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state anti-corruption regulator .
Former Minister of New Wales of South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he changed the trade policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden interests in three goods in the area controlled by the government .
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC ) broadened its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had put pressure on a number of State ministers to renew his bones in Circular Four , where the Obeds possess two restaurants and coffee , after their expiry in August 2005 , without any call for tenders .
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary-General of Mr Tripoldi , Lynne Ashpole , on Thursday .
During the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government has pressed for the bones to be subject to tenders .
The tenants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , the beds concerning the companies in Circular Four , which reported to Obeid about $ 2.5 a year , were renewed without any call for tenders .
Mr Tripodi , who was Minister for Ports from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of tenders .
But he denied that he changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid , who recognised Mr Tripodi , called for a change in government policy on blending .
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC has shown appeals in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid , Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid to the Ministry of Fisheries .
&quot; The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of trade policy , &quot; asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi .
&apos;No &apos; , replied to Mr Tripodi .
I do not remember what we have discussed , but at least it was not .
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid .
Israeli War planes
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Litkia on Thursday evening , confirms a military officer at Fox News .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said that at least there was one .
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125 .
At least twice this year , Israel conducted air strikes against missiles in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa could have a “ authenticity ” test .
The government is currently considering the possibility of putting in place a &apos; authenticity test &apos; for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the repressive measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion for preventing 457 visas from being used to occupy unskilled posts or as a hijack to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A working document from the government has been unveiled today , while Labour MEP Maxine McKew denounced the government speech on foreign workers , saying that it could offend Australia &apos;s neighbours .
“ The fractured statements about &quot; foreigners returning to the end &quot; and &quot; jobs for Australians first &quot; are a disagreeable return at the time when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , she said to the Australian Indian Institute today .
Historically , this meant that the work of the White Paper had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artestant .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by the former Minister of Migration Chris Bowen .
The Minister for Migration Bacan O &apos;Connor , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials in order to discuss trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are under review .
If the &apos; authenticity &apos; criterion was adopted , a visa seeker could be checked on &apos; if the job supply is authentic in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person in the company that sponsors sponsors &apos; .
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them , having intended to sponsor a small number of workers , actually employed hundreds .
Meanwhile , a 30-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would be dead from a heart crisis after having arrived on a ship carrying asylum seekers on the island of Christmas this week .
The snapshot of man , aged 9 , went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board .
The man has been transferred as a matter of urgency by the Australian authorities to the hospital in Christmas , where he died .
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work carried out by HS2 Litd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of the Phase 1 by 2026 .
The Transport Minister baronne Kramer said that the project would bring together the United Kingdom .
The Scottish Minister for Transport , Keith Brown , has said ‘ excitement ’ to working with the British Government on the project .
Phase 1 will be on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands .
When the Phase 2 is completed , the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England , from £ 32.7 million to £ 42.6 million .
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of journeys for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travel dues between Glasgow and Edinburgh three hours at the most .
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our objective for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer . ”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous .
Without it , we have a problem with the capacity of our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 large British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Allistar Carmihel , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &apos;
For the Scottish Government , Keith Brown has called on Mr Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network unequivocally .
Mr Brown said : &apos; The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings Scotland &apos;s economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network across Britain .
‘ We are therefore excited about working in partnership with the British Government to examine options for bringing the high-speed train network up to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgo-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
&quot; I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year , and then we will decide on the next steps together . &apos;
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and smartphonies during take-off and landing despite the US gesture to ease the regulation of electronic devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch videos , or play games on their appliances during critical flight periods , provided they are in an air fashion .
Passengers can already do so for most of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during take-off and landing .
Australian carriers are looking at the decision which obliges US carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Aviation Authority also stated that it was examining the announcement , but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia .
‘ The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft ’ .
The issue is subject to a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to ensure permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Virgin , who has already spoken to CASA about its intention to extend the use of its entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology , was open to change , but said that it would follow the regulator .
‘ We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer ’ s experience now that we have – from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology on our aeroplanes – a spokesman .
Qantas has said that she is currently complying with the current rules .
&apos;According to our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing , and we do not intend to change this immediately &apos; , she said .
The FAA decision applies to US airlines .
However , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that may benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it .
For US carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices , as well as review textbooks , training equipment , hand-baggage transport schemes and the instructions provided to passengers .
“ As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use light-touch electronic devices , such as tablets , e-maker readers and smarphphonies to all altitudes , ” said the FAA .
In the rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to extinguish their appliances during landing .
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft should be safe in the seats or in higher compartments during take-off and landing .
Pia : at least four injured
The little of Pia has experienced an unusual fever on Thursday evening .
Three Gendarmerie vehicles , two ambulances and a stumbling block of 30 people according to the testimonies collected ...
On this day of Hallaween , the evening was stirred up on the side of Pia , where a rig involving several people broke out on the Post side .
Four injured at least would be to regret .
Alternatively , the police have been there to separate the warring parties and to ensure that the injured are charged .
Singapore ’ s Class lenders
For a lender at the Bendemer trade centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga is putting a brake , a joke , and a buck of gold ear to pay for his daughters ’ schooling .
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , therefore , all my money , ” says Mrs Amirthalinga .
Although it earns $ 3,000 in Singapore ( $ 2,400 ) per month as an adversary , and its husband is also working , monthly family income is not enough .
In fact , demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that Valumax , where it has carried out its transaction , has become the third loan company that will be introduced to the Singapore exchange .
Putting jewels out is not only a quick way to get liquid money – $ 1 300 in Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .
In general , the Singapore lenders set up an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % offered by the United Overseas Bank , a local fund provider with a branch in the same business centre .
But there is the advantage of not asking for a creditworthiness or salary check , and can release loans faster than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region turn to the lenders , while families are feeling the pressure of rising living costs and over-indebtedness of households and consumers .
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fueled by too lax a monetary policy in advanced economies , low-income and middle-income families turn to collateral lenders to bridge the difference while their economies are slowing .
This week , the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poora cited the growing debt of households , resulting mainly from the rise in mortgage lending , as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore had the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in Asia .
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , while the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged this week from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
“ The balance sheet is that , with the rise in costs , people in the middle or the bottom are seeking to supplement their income as they can , ” says Song Seng Wun , an economist at ICMB , an Malaysian bank .
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have meant that people have been quick to make their personal impact felt to affect the cash value of their jewels .
In Singapore , about 70 % of the items in the 200 buod-state lending shops are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us have the gold chain of grandmother &apos; and we will look back next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest loan broker operator , EasyMoney , has recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using their shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the loan sector that ValumeMax , Bendemer , and 15 other sludge such as this in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighboring Malaysia – where there are already four sludge – but also outside Asia , says Yeah Lee Ching , its Directorate-General .
Society will finance them by using 60 % of the $ 66 trillion in Singapore that it removed this week from its introduction to the Singapore exchange .
While some low-interest lenders have suffered criticism for the exorbitant interest rates that they are practising , Miss Yeah indicates that the supply offers not only lower rates than other lenders , but also does not directly increase debt .
“ The customers are selling goods that they already have , and monetizing their personal goods does not increase household debt , ” she says .
The establishment is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term funding .
The people who travel to the lenders are not just those who have financial problems .
The aided people of Singapore are also going to the Valumax loan buffer in order to build up gold looms or Rolex monsters , which can represent up to 60 % of their cash purchase prices .
We see customers from all sections of society .
“ It may be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment activities , or small businesses with cash needs to go a difficult course , ” adding Miss Yeah .
Sometimes they just need money very quickly .
Paster accused of juvenile pornography in New Scotland
A father who took care of young people in the Halifax region in New Scotland is accused of juvenile pornography .
Aaron Hudgins , 30 years old , was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council Office where he works .
The Baptist church of Timberlay , where the official officer was , is deeply saddened by this news .
In a communiqué , the church officials indicate that Mr Hudgins has resigned from his post .
The boss has been released under conditions .
In particular , it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet .
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December .
He is in Nazi uniform in the supermarket .
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform of a breward with the gambled cross was asked to leave an English supermarket , with customers complaining to the leadership of the establishment that called the police , indicated the shop on Friday .
&apos;We have received several complaints from customers , so we have asked him to leave the shop &apos; , explained a spokesman for the supermarket in Asda .
The shop called the police to rescue him , but &apos; the time she arrives , he has already gone unscathed &apos; .
I was queuing up when I saw a woman who seemed to be shocked .
People were mouthful .
&apos;You do not get out of the street unless you want to draw attention &apos; , showed a client , Rosina Rusin , 60 years ago in the Cambridge News newspaper .
This incident took place on Thursday , day of the Hallween Day , where it is customary to disguise itself as a monster , but it was difficult to know whether it was a canular .
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account , where he put forward images of Adolf Hitler .
&apos;I have a SS SS twice a week for three years in Asda &apos; , said Paul Dutton , explaining &apos; mental problems &apos; .
$ 325 million rescue plan for the Tasmania health system
The federal government maintains that the $ 325 million rescue package for the health care system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that government government does not waste money .
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pollibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “ urgent measures ” to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
The funding , planned for four years , was decided after consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania , Andrew Wilkie .
&apos;The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which , in our view , will solve the unique difficulties that the State is facing &apos; , said Mrs Plibersek today .
The 325 M plan includes a $ 31 M campaign for non-urgent surgical operations .
A further 2 600 operations , including orthopaedic surgery and cataract , will help catch up .
Funds are also planned for clinics without meetings at Hobart and Launceston , better external care , training of medical frameworks , mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical files in local hospitals .
“ These investments respond to the idea that , according to first-line clinicians , this is the best way to cure the Tasmania health system , ” Mrs Plibersek said .
The Minister said that the Tasmania Government would be faced with a strict regime of preparation for reports and reporting .
The state will have to maintain the current levels of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends the additional funds .
A committee of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wilkie said today that the 325 M will not count for much &apos; unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate the public health system of Tasmania &apos; .
Nevertheless , he congratulated the government on responding to the urgent request for assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister in early May .
&quot; I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system of Tasmanon from the blacklist , Mr Wilkie .
According to the government government , these non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But the health opposition spokesperson Peter Dutton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a “ makeshift solution . ”
“ The reason we are here is that the state Labour Government has withdrawn 430 M from its health system , ” he said on ABC TV .
We cannot have a government government that takes up almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth , which puts $ 300 , and claim that it is a good day .
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Pollibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the novel of Denis Diderot boasts a remarkable artistic leadership and a thorough recovery of time , but it is also more laborious than it should be .
Falling in France in the 1760 ’ s , she tells the dark story of Suzanne , a young aristocrat sent in a curse by her family .
When it is rebel , it faces the unbearable cruelty of a deliberately sadian Mother , and is becoming a subject of eroding the two .
The film never pays in clear-cut or sensationalism , and that is the problem .
The conscientious nature of the narrative could also become a penny for the public .
Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , says the supervisory body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for producing chemical weapons and ammunition with toxic gas , declared the international chemical weapons monitoring body on Thursday , while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago .
The announcement of the Organisation for the banning of chemical weapons ( ICAO ) came with one day on the deadline of the deadline for the deadline for the banning of chemical weapons .
1 November set by the organisation based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or &apos; make all units of chemical weapons and machinery to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition unusable &apos; .
The completion of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus &apos;s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .
With the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Damascus still has to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves .
It is estimated that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons , including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was raging on Thursday in the town of Safira , which , according to experts , is home to a unit of production of chemical weapons and storage sites , reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain .
The group of activists , following the development of the human balance through a network of militants based in Syria , said on Thursday that 120 296 people died .
Of them , there were 61 067 civilians , including 6 365 children .
On the government side , it is estimated that 29 954 members of President Bashar al-Assad ’ s armed forces died , including 18 678 fighters of pro-government forces and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants .
Of the deaths , it is also estimated that 2 202 were deserters and some 5 375 of the opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since then .
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
Assad ’ s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups , in Saafra for weeks .
The Centre said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but did not give any precision .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that is continuing , within tight deadlines .
A statement by the OIC , which works in close collaboration with the UN , indicated that its team was “ now satisfied with controlled – and destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling . ”
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was scheduled for the moment &apos; .
Earlier this week the inspectors said that they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus .
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their security , indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the ICAO said that the two sites , according to Syria , were &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspected &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safra unit was one of the two sites that the ICAO inspectors were unable to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which was approved by the IIAC Executive Committee .
“ I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all demonstrated in the most difficult task ever undertaken by this organisation , ” declared the Director-General of the organisation Ahmet Uzuescu , in a comment published by the ICAO .
Now , in its third year , the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels in the Assad government and its security forces , which are supported by members of the alaoui sect , a branch of Shia Islam .
On the other hand , the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Litkia .
The cause of the explosion remains unknown , he added .
A Columbus caused by the punishment of one of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice , saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an implementing lunch .
Patek , who spent almost 10 years in flight by being one of the most sought men in South-East Asia , was sentenced yesterday to a 20-year-old prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks .
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta , which caused the deaths of 202 people , including 88 Australians , and caused many injured .
It has also been found guilty of many other charges in relation to terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The prosecutors have asked for a sentence of life punishment , yet they could have asked for the man , known as the &apos; Man Man &apos; for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs , to be condemned to death .
The decision revived painful memories for Ja Corteen , a mother of Perth who lost her two twin two twins , Jane and Jenny , in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago .
On the brink of tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should have gone along with the other men .
&apos;He should be dragged before the executing &apos; , said Mrs Corteen to the APA .
I have to live on a daily basis without having any other grandchildren or my daughters .
The Sari Club was fully destroyed when an enormous bomb , charged in a gate of gagging abroad , exploded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in Paddydis Bar when a suicide bomber sacked a sack with explosives with only 20 seconds earlier .
He sank in the coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month , and he is “ dead ” three times when he was under respiratory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for carnage – Amrozi , Muklas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
To keep it alive is why there is no reason to keep it alive .
It is not much .
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years , but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbotbete , where US forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , less than four months later .
During the trial , an agent of the FBI said that reports of intelligence services revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al Qaeda .
&quot; He did not go , &quot; added Mrs Corteen .
Until recently , he was harmed by the sorrow he had been able to cause to others .
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia .
“ There will be a lot of beaches this year , ” Mrs Corteen said .
However , Patek can use his condemnation .
FAA : air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft ( but not through their mobile phone )
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic gad-door devices to read , work , play games , watch films , and listen to music – but not to talk about their mobile phone – under the new , very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another , declared the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta at a press conference .
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the crew training books and the rules on the conformity of aircraft to be in conformity .
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of electronic devices on their aircraft .
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&apos;depending on the plan , we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon &apos; , indicated the FAA in a statement .
At present , passengers must extinguish their smartphonies , tablets and other appliances as soon as the doors of the plane are closed .
They are not supposed to rally them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and the commander gives the green light .
Passengers are supposed to extinguish their appliances on the descent of the plane before the landing , and not to rash them up until the plane has been created .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-off , landing and ground rolling , declared the FAA .
Most of the new airplanes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi to higher altitude , should meet the criteria .
Lwill Glading , Chair of the Association of Provisional Flight Attempts , was pleased about these changes .
“ Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with carriers for that – it will benefit everyone , ” explained Glading in a statement .
We are , frankly , tired of feeling like ‘ hormone ’ when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet for surfing , exchanging email , and SMS or downloading data below 10 000 feet , declared the agency .
Passengers will have to put their smartphonies , tablets and other aircraft aircraft .
So , still not at Words With Friends , the Srbble game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his marshphone in 2011 when he was expelled from an American Airlines aeroplane after refusing to extinguish his apparatus when the apparatus was kept at the door .
And heavier appliances such as laptops will always have to be contested because they could injure someone if they were flying through the cabin .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Commission and not to the FAA .
The FAA
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Standard Safey Bard , a national transport safety expert on CBS News , said that mobile phones were always considered a risk .
&apos;The mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with the navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the FCCC , that they could disrupt mobile telephones if they are used on board &apos; , said Rosenker .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government permits the wider use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to relax restrictions on their use .
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskl , D-Mo , argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of aircraft has become ubiquitous .
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extinguish their appliances , or deliberately do so .
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communications instruments when passengers were carrying radios FM , the high-tech gadgets of then .
New airplanes are much more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA .
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi to cruise allegiance for several years .
The modified aircraft to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resisting interference .
The vast majority of airplanes should allow the wider use of electronic devices under the new directives .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally emit much weaker radio transmission than previous generations of aircraft .
Electronic books , for example , only emit minimum transmissions when you turn a page .
But transmissions are stronger when it comes to downloading or sending data .
Amazon.com is one of those who lobby for relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , the company ’ s leaders charged a Kindle e-maker air-on-line aircraft and fly to see if there were problems , but there was none .
This inspired the members of the FAA advisory committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of aircraft presents a risk .
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that interference from aircraft was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of them are very old .
However , the committee has recommended that the FAA should allow pilots to ask passengers to extinguish their appliances during landing to instruments under low visibility conditions .
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes , calling for full arrangements of common sense for travellers with technologies .
‘ We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security ’ , said Roger Dow , President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association .
A North Sea platform
A bird , shelded after having been exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea , has been released in nature .
The water rank was raised on a helicopter helicopter in Aberdeen last month before the Scottish SPCA was released in its Alova rescue centre .
The center of the center , Colin Seddon , said : “ This water rank was probably a winter migratory that came from northern Europe and found itself in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea . ”
It seems that the old bird would have found refuge on the oil platform .
He added : ‘ He was unable to fly again , so we were contacted to help him . ’
The water rank was healthy when it was released .
Is the European elite prepared to do business with Britain ?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together companies and defining what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
In order to do this , we have commissioned the widest and most complete investigation into British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , businesses and the EU .
YouGoev questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , who are generally representative of all sizes of companies , sectors and regions of Britain .
The findings of the inquiry will come as a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating .
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcane .
When asked for their opinion on specific political points – ranging from the regulation of the monopolies to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key skills should go back to Westminster .
The single market has caused general discontent , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that there is to be part of the European trade area – 40 % of large companies , traditionally the most pro-European ones , even agree .
Last but not least , our investigation into business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue the initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .
This conclusion , which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a “ significant change ” that gives power to the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high – a change in the treaty and better representing Britain ’ s interests would mean a 16 % shift in votes in favor of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not doubt just one moment : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power for a return to the UK .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of British companies , since the eurozone is committed to closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for companies this means placing the emphasis once again on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels .
The United States to Hallaween
In the US , President Obama has not deviated from the tradition of Hallween .
Last night , with his wife , he distributed frictions to hundreds of children invited to the White House in Washington .
Last year , Hallween festivities on the US coast were cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy .
This year , therefore , the celebration of the celebrating has taken up .
In New York , thousands of costestic people participated in the parade organised in the &quot; Greenwich village &quot; .
Everyone is over-quoted , told one of the participants , Andrea .
I was finally able to put the suit that I had planned last year .
We are amused like mad , adding Rhonda .
People are happy .
It is a good child , it is cool .
We really need that .
Hallaween is a ploy celebration celebrated on the eve of the Tousaint , mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries .
Alexi Miller of Gazprom says that Bulgaria ’ s gas pipeline inhibits a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared Gazprom &apos;s director .
&apos;An historic event has taken place today : construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most important project in Europe &apos; , explained Alexi Miller , the Director-General of Gazprom , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of Europe .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart , a country in which most Russian gas is transported to Europe , increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes , adds the director .
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated &apos; forever &apos; .
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas from South Stream at a reduced tariff once the whole project is put into operation in 2015 .
Gazprom has indicated that construction should start in other countries downstream by the end of the year .
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas .
Pitcairn
The Isle of Pitcairn wants to create the world &apos;s largest marine reserve , announced on Thursday the New Year of Tahii , taking on an information from Radio Australia .
This island , in the east of the Gamer archipelago ( French Polynesia ) , is the last British territory in the South Pacific , halfway between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory is 47 km2 , with three other small islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutilated of the Bouty , the episode of the English navy , which gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations .
A few dozen inhabitants , most of whom are descendants of the Flooty , still live in Pitcairn , and their incomes depend on 95 % of London ’ s generosity .
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago , which is 836,000 km2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London asking Britain to validate this request .
Mike Warren , the Mayor of Pitcainn , believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for its island .
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to scrap these 836,000 km2 , provided , however , that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in Pitcairn , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance in the area , and there is no port in which to place military surveillance vessels .
As for France , it must already carry out the very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia EEZ , which is a neighbour of Pitcairn .
The FAA relaxed restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones .

A Prison for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jiin in northeast China was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption .
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012 , Tian Xueren was accused of having affected more than 19 million yuans of bribes , reporting Chinese official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Governor , who was also the President of the Bank of Jiin , a public establishment , helped companies and responsible to obtain contracts , loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts , declared the first interim court in Beijing on his microphone .
President Xi Jinping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party .
If the head of state promised that justice would also be intractable with the powerful &apos; tigers &apos; , the subservient civil servants - only a handful of senior officials were sentenced , including former managers of the oil giant Petrochina .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP chief in Chongqing , Bo Xilai , who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office in the state .
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating , for example , an independent party .
Two YMA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord , at a royal Commission hearing .
Two YMCA employees in New Wales have been accused of sexual assault against children following allegations against the Caringbah educator , Jonathan Lord , in 2011 , at a royal Commission hearing charged with child sex abuse .
But in his opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA said that it had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children within its organisation . &apos;
The Director General Phillip Hare was asked about two cases : an employee of the YMCA was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a PMA Caringbah Hall physical education instructor was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre in which he worked in 1991 .
Mr Hare said to Gail Früness , who is a lawyer to the Commission , that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the ICMA opening statement was inaccurate by underlining , “ external controls of the YMA have been made and have indicated that child safety is an absolute priority for the organisation . ”
It has been demonstrated to the Commission that the YMA had been informed that it had received a few more poor assessments of four institutions in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year .
Mr Hare , who began to work in the YMCA at the age of 21 , admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord , and he failed to check that the employees knew that they were obliged to report any violation of child safety policy .
Earlier this year , Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked in the YMCA .
He has been sentenced to a six-year prison sentence .
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord &apos;s shortcomings in child safety .
The members of staff have shown that they have observed certain shortcomings , including the fact that Lord remained alone with children , that he kept them in private , made them sit on his knees , told them that he loved them and left them with his mobile phone .
Danielell Ockwell , who was regulated by Lord and asked for training for child protection because she was worried about her behaviour , indicated that she found the child service responsible for the YMCA Caringbach , Jacis Barnat , who would be a very intimidating and difficult Lord .
The Director-General said that he rejected the staff testimonies that they were reluctant to report these failings to their hierarchical superiors .
Instead , he said that his friendly relations with Lord have bluntled their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Hare said that he had expressed his point of view before the South Wales council of New Wales saying that , for the organisation , the lesson learned from the &apos; Jonathan Lord incident &apos; should not be &apos; reporting by staff &apos; , and the Council agrees with him .
Mr Hare has said that the decision to sign up to the staff of the confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations have been made , was taken by the Director-General of the YMICA , Liam White .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence , but that it was an &apos; excess zeal &apos; and had been badly implemented .
The YMA in New Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed , namely between 2009 and 2011 , declared the expert on sexual violence against children , Professor Stephen Smallone of the University of Griffith before the Commission .
He said that there were &apos; serious problems &apos; in recruitment , control , initiation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return to prime minister , but recognize that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term , the 55-year man made his views on various national policies known .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the top of the country , Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet ’ s special envoy for the Middle East peace process .
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to Evening Standard in London : &apos; Yes , of course , but may it happen ? &apos;
When many experts in quaestors met in Cardiff to face up to and win the hophy of the year , they knew that competition would be tough .
But no one expected to see Frenon Kirres , a three-year child .
Not yet at school , and only a few months after having made its first weapons , the twin , Shetland Toffe , trotted in the three rounds with great ease and won the first price , leaving the 30 other adult competitors behind them .
The two inseparable inseparables – which are the same size – were saluted for the presentation , attitude , and style of the annual contest that took place at the center of Sunnybank , in Rudy near Cardiff .
Coming against men and women in elegant meteers , he had his hat on the side in a relaxed way in order to defy his ten-year-old Toffer pony around the runway .
The judges have been welcomed by the judges for their uncommon natural qualities for a child of his age .
And Toffer received very good notes for his presentation and personality .
On the one hand , there was Toffee for his 3rd birthday last March , and has since taken place with his poney Shetland every day .
His mother Dona , 30 years ago , said : &apos; Trenon and Toffee do an excellent duo &apos; .
They have presented themselves to and against everyone , but the two have razed the gold cut and the rocket .
It was only the second time that he had lived with Toffee and we were insane that he won .
On the runway , people who did not know that it was so phenomenal that they wanted to photograph with him .
This young boy , the village of Nantyglo , near Eubow Vale , in southern Wales , is following the footsteps of his counterpart Sharon Howells , who has been participating in quaestors for more than 10 years .
Mrs Howitt said : &apos; There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging it and applauded it &apos; .
He has travelled all the way and even if he seemed to be very small , he did a wonderful job .
It is a fog of animals – it admits horses , tractors , and the rural world and has two chickens .
From the way he has started , he will surely be taking part in this year ’ s Cheval demonstration – and I am sure he will make a good contribution .
A spokesperson for the annual questioner said : &apos; Tranve only three years , but he knows how to conduct his pony &apos; .
They are a good team .
The judges noted that Penon and Toffee presented well and the way in which they marched on the track .
They are looking for effective teamwork between the ponder and the trainer – Penon and Toffee have been the best on the track .
I am sure his beautiful clothes helped Fmenton , he really was proud .
A Chinese newspaper , which launched an appeal :
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is going to be revised , says a press regulator .
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .
But Mr Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society .
Now the New Express is going to undergo a “ complete overhaul , ” the regulator said .
The order of “ reshuffle ” comes from Guangdon ’ s administration for Press and Edition , Radio , Film , and Television .
A preliminary survey showed that the New Express , belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group , published a number of erroneous articles on the Zoomlion society between September 2012 and August 2013 .
“ New Express was disorganised , ” the regulator said in a statement .
He said that he had decided &apos; to impose an administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card &apos; .
He also “ ordered the Yangcheng Evening Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express , and recommended that he should conduct an investigation into the people responsible in New Express and immediately redirect the newspaper ’ s leadership team . ”
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities of a shipyard manufacturer known as Zoomlion .
After his arrest , his newspaper published on two occasions a first-page call for his release , writing that he supported his journalism .
But Mr Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories about money .
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he said to the public television network CCCTV .
I did so mainly because I was running after the money and the celebrity .
I have seen my error .
Following the apologies of Mr Chen , New Express made his apologies on the first page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects have recently made television judgments .
Experts say that people are systematically forced to do their own , despite a change in the law that was adopted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to blame himself .
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle
In Toulon , the aircraft carrier is on the rails .
The leak of radioactive vapour detected on one of the two nuclear heaters of Charle-de Gaulle in mid-October , while the ship was at sea , was &apos; safe for seafarers &apos; , but it is not without consequences for the Marine .
Indeed , the Royal has just confirmed to us &apos; the unavailability &apos; of the vessel until &apos; mid-November &apos; , &apos; time to take the necessary corrective measures &apos; on the reactor .
For its part , the DNS-specialist company , DNC , ensures that its teams and those of Areva , who are caught in the Var for the time being , &apos; intervene on aircraft carriers &apos; .
It is for them , among other things , to change a pump on the faulty heating .
&apos;Everything is being done to ensure that Charles de Gaulle can make his planned deployment at the end of 2013 &apos; .
And the national Mariine to certify that &apos; it does not call into question the nuclear propulsion programme &apos; .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is out of an interim period of six months .
In mid-October , he set up Toulon for training .
This , in particular , is to describe young hunting pilots .
A &apos; small charity &apos; , which is confined to the containment space of the reactor , was then produced on the flagship ship of the French fleet .
According to the National Marine , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a great deal of discontent on the part of the people I meet : the monstrous revaluation of their properties , the deduction of taxes , the cost of all kinds of licences , the administrative costs that are not ending .
In short , there is no limit to our pockets .
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful tax on those who pay .
Any money taken away from the taxpayer is reducing their freedom of consumption and contributing to their impoverishment .
In Shawinigan , despite the closure of all major companies , there is no embarrassment about somptuary spending and the maintenance of lame ducks : a deficient cultural centre , a strong subsidy to the Energy City , etc .
If these facilities are not profitable , they are sold to private companies or are being scrapped .
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come .
However , I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator , but at what cost to tax payers ?
It is not up to the public to invest in such companies , but to the private sector on the basis of consumer demand .
People were pleased to learn that the lakes in the Fisheries and Pials will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
As a result of the departure of all industries ( large water consumers ) and the large decline in the population , water use has fallen considerably across the territory .
Without wishing to waste it , the city will never miss water , and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly admired .
In short , it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others .
I would be ashamed to defend such a review .
With a gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a loan regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years by skies with great qualifications for most , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse .
Owing to a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting , ventilation and electric rails , has been discovered .
The US authorities have described the 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages that they had ever seen .
The tunnel , zzzagging on a length of almost six long-term football fields , connects warehouses near Tijana , Mexico , San Diego , the United States .
The area is full of intractable warehouses , which makes it easy to conceal the trucks responsible for drugs .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it , and the authorities said that they were .
The authorities confiscated 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered , according to legal cases .
Three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers , were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with a sales intention .
They are running a prison sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are condemned .
In Nogals , in Arizona , traffickers exploit extensive underground drainage channels .
The tunnel is the eighth important passage in San Diego since 2006 .
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered as a result of the marijuana harvest in the centre of Mexico in October , posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 yards fitted with railways from the kitchen of a Tijana house and went to two San Diego warehouses .
The British police
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange , who took refuge in Ecuador &apos;s Ambassador in London and called for political asylum .
Scotland Yard said that she had issued a “ surrender opinion ” against Australians of 40 years , asking him to present himself to a police commission , adding that if he did not , he could be arrested .
Assange could be extradited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime , having exhausted every possible avenue under the British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal that it made against its extradition at the beginning of the month .
Chosting that Stockholm allows its transfer to the United States , it found refuge in Ecuador &apos;s Ambassy in London on 19 June , asking that country of South America political asylum .
Scotland Yard has “ issued an opinion against a 40-year-old man who calls on him to present himself to a police officer , on date , and when his choice , ” declared a spokesman .
It continues to violate the conditions for its release under bail .
The Ambassador has refused to comment on the issue of issuing the opinion by the police .
Assange is afraid to be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage , having unveiled more than 250 000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information .
How Biometrics
Finn the words to be tasked with access to his or her Smartphone ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by the biometric captors of phones and computers .
Bernard Didier , Deputy Director of Morpho , even believes that the century will be biometric .
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in such a cross-border and transnational world as the Internet .
Organisations dedicated to the protection of private life confirm this enslavement for biometrics , but are concerned about it .
In 2011 and France alone , the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the form of hand or the veinous network of hand in companies , administrations , canteens ...
“ Everyone can soon be identified , anywhere and no matter ” , moved Jutiin Brookman , who is responsible for consumer privacy in the CDC ( Center for Democracy and Technology ) , in Washington .
The reasons for such optimism , among some and pessimism , among others ?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques , which will enable new services to be made available to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are fingerprinting , the hand of hand and the vein network of the pause or fingers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;For example , some people who work the concrete have the fingers of the fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable &apos; , notes Philippe Robin , the technical director of the identity area in Thales Communications .
And the collection and verification of the veinous network and the hand of hand mean a voluntary and precise gesture of people .
It is both a safety - one cannot capture the data from them - and one drawback : the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time .
As a result , research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches , such as the recognition of face or mouse ( the colourful part ) .
With the increase in the accuracy of the captors and the ability to calculate the computers required for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The precision of facial recognition has increased ten times over the last five years , along with Cyrile Batller , head of R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posters using facial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or an mouse on the move .
&apos;Today we are carrying out research into the recognition of the voice or the way in which we can walk with sound sensors , but we need a silent environment &apos; , says Srdhar Iyengar , the head of security research to Intel Labs .
A unique and infallible Marquer , the DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
&apos;In the current state of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirms Sophi-Tullier , the Director of the Studies , Innovation and Provision for CNIL .
But DNA analysis is still very long and costly .
It is proposed that the judicial police services should be worth EUR 90,000 to analyse DNA samples in the place of a crime and in an hour .
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups : identification ( recognising one person among others ) and authentication ( ensuring that the person is the one it claims to be ) .
The identification has so far concerned the issuing of identity papers : biometric elements ( fingerprints , photo and iis ) have to be confronted with the information that the state has on all citizens already enshrined .
This helps to ensure that someone does not try to usurp someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison may have other applications .
This is why it is proposed that VVP should be recognised in a hotel or shop .
&apos;We are recovering the images of the surveillance cameras and comparing them with the photos of the celebrities circulating freely on the Internet &apos; , explains Dany Nassif , who is responsible , at NEC France , for commercial development for biometric identification solutions .
Another use is to look at a sham that is queuing in a shop , to follow its progress through facial recognition and calculate waiting times .
Reification initially concerned physical access ( borders , protected local , canteens , etc . ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
More recently , there has been a review of the presence .
&apos;A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the Coptic which is leading for another &apos; , justifies Cyrile Batller , Accente .
More and more , however , authentication will also concern transactions , especially those made from Internet connections .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric reader : this gesture replaces the hallmark of the secret code .
A similar technique is tested in Villenuveve-d &apos;Ascq and in Angusory by the Natural Security company in partnership with the big distribution banks and teachers : when paying in shop with its banking card , the customer is not treading his code , but he is bringing his finger into a reader who is scanning the calves .
The experiment is planned for six months .
If it is conclusive , biometric readers may soon reach French traders .
Moves to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public .
The first is to explain that it can save time .
&quot; If , thanks to biometrics , a client remains in 30 seconds less , it is good , &quot; explains the director of a large area .
The second is to offer personalised services : in a few years &apos; time , a voice server will be able to recognise your voice and propose tailor-made options .
And finally , reassuring by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;fingerprints are stored on a first server ; people &apos; s identities are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure boxes , which are blocked if you try to move it &apos; , lists Philippe Robin , Thales .
But , without in-depth studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
Private privacy experts continue to worry .
&apos;The progress of facial recognition , the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge quantity of photographs available on Facebook , Flickr or Picama , leads me to fear the worst : widespread surveillance &apos; , predicted Andrew Patrick , the Commissioner for Private Protection in Canada .
A driver of 210 km / h with a hot drink between legs has been meted out of £ 1 000 .
A car driver has been fined £ 1 000 for driving at 210 km / h with a hot drink that is balanced between his legs .
Andrew Howie , 35 years of Tippy in Essex , was repaired leading his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Brantree on 27 May .
When the police arrested it , they discovered the drink to take between its legs .
In the Court of First Instance of Columbia , Howa admitted a breach of conduct without the necessary caution and attention .
The seven points that have been withdrawn from the permit have led to a six-month withdrawal of licences .
Howa has also been sentenced to pay for £ 90 , and an overtax for the victim of £ 100 .
A Tax on Foreign homeowners
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the measure of the tax on capital gains , but expects a final decision from Mr Osborne , who , in the 2012 budget , has put a 7 % right of stamp for the properties costing more than £ 2 million and the annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually .
The right of tree already applies to the residential properties of the Lestminster and Kensington &amp; Celsea districts , and represents GBP 708 million on the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , north-west and the Yorkshire and Humber combined .
Mr Cook said : &apos; As a result of the increase in the right of tree on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area , it is very difficult to make progress that the valuable properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the outdated residential tax system . &apos;
“ But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the current owners who are reluctant to sell , ” he added .
Private housing – the 5 % to 10 % of the highest prices in the housing market – in the prosperous sector in the south-west of London that is crying from Fulham to Wimbedon , increased by a record percentage of 11.8 % last year .
Prices in the center of London are annual growth of 5.6 % per year , but have been overshadowed by a growing “ internal market ” , the south-west of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the ( 6.5 % ) , with a recovery , according to Savos studies .
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog ’ s queue are linked to its mood .
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs won their queue to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while the nervous dogs won the left more .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them .
Professor Georgio Vallorgargara , a neuroscience at the University of Trente , said : &apos; Everyone knows that , in man , the left side and the right of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions &apos; .
Here we have tried to see what is happening in other species .
He added that , as well as in humans , among dogs the right to the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and the two hemisphere played a different role in emotions .
To know more about how dogs respond to the disordered queue movements of other dogs , researchers have followed animals looking to films where other dogs were found .
They have measured the heart frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their queue sometimes goes on one side and sometimes the other .
Professor Vallorgargara said : “ We have presented to dogs of films in which other dogs were found – or a naturalist version is a silver to avoid any further cause of confusion – and we have been able to manipulate the queue movement and present it to the left or the right . ”
When the animals saw a dog without an expression of the queue to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that was blowing the queue ) , they remained perfectly relaxed .
But when they peaked a queue mainly to the left ( again from the point of view of the dog that bore the queue ) , their heart frequency has accelerated , and they look uneasy .
Professor Vallortin said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with these movements .
Instead , he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet many other dogs on several occasions , and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their queue to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side is playing a less friendly attitude , you will react to this experience . &apos;
Researchers indicate that the results could enable owners , veterinarians , and daughters to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The Bramshaw expert expert , a professor of the Bristol University School , made it clear that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the cane .
Last year , a team of Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a joyful dog .
And , in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada , he said : “ The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his queue won the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study . ”
He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully regard animals or robot dogs as dogs .
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
“ Although there are many elements in different mammals that indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception ’ , he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not be long before we understand why their queues sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other .
Ark Monkeys
The Artik Monkeys rock group has postponed a concert in Glasgow after a lynch has been diagnosed with its singer .
The Swiffield group was to take place on Friday in the Hydroo concert in the town town .
However , his lynch forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle .
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday .
In a statement on their official site , the Artic Monkeys said : “ Following the decision to postpone the concert to LG Arena from Birmingham this evening , and after asking for a medical opinion , the Artic Monkeys must also postpone the spectacle to the Hydroo de Glasgow on Friday 1 November . ”
&quot; Alex Turner suffers from a lynch , and regrets that he cannot be in concert . &quot;
The spectacle at LG Arena of Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the Hydroo de Glasgow will be held on 21 November .
All tickets remain valid for these concerts .
We would like to apologise to all the ticket holders for any discomfort .
Thank you for contacting the client service to the ticket where you have bought your tickets for any additional assistance .
Pope François
The Pope , Francis François , will appoint new Cardinges of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , announced the Vatican on Thursday .
Cardinal men are the highest church men in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect it , so François will appoint his first group of men who ultimately choose his successor .
There are now 201 Cardinal .
But , as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer take part in the election of a Pope – that is , a group of 120 “ cardiners ” .
In a statement announcing the new , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that a meeting of all the existing cardinal cardinal groups would take place before the ceremony in which bishops will be raised to the dignity of Cardinal , known as the conisterate .
“ The Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consisture in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Cardinal Cardinal in different parts of the world , ” said Lombardi .
Jack Valero of Catholics said that by February the number of voters will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinal as he needed to ensure that the number of voters in the electorate had 120 and so many cardinals over 80 years old .
The next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year .
At the moment , there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe , especially Italy .
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardiners of the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he added .
Forty per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America , but a small number of cardiners represent them .
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the Cardinal Council , a group of eight cardinges around the world to examine ways to reform the church .
Previously , the Pope decided alone .
“ From now on , François chose these eight cardinals to help him ” , explained Valert .
He added that he was &apos; perfectly possible &apos; which François is asking for advice to the Cardinal .
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new .
Valero said that the popes were generally bishops representing large communities as a Cardinal , but François was “ full of surprises ” – so we do not know who he will appoint .
GM recalls some of its new pickolps in the US
General Motors Co is recalling almost 19 000 of his new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC pickolps in order to deal with a problem with the files of the US body responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some pickolps , the seats before could present a defect in the mechanism of inclination .
As a result , the dossiers do not meet the federal safety standards of vehicles with regard to the e-heads .
“ If the vehicle is permeated by the back , it may be that the e-heads do not adequately protect passengers , thereby increasing the risk of injuries , ” according to the declaration on the site of the National Highway Traffic Administration ( NHTSA ) .
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of the GM pipps started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and its restructuring in 2009 .
GM informed the owners of the defect in the first half of October .
The NHTSA was unable to examine the letter of information to the owners because of the 16 days ruling of government activities , which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October .
The sales of Silverado and Sierra Leone , which were redrawn for the 2014 model , rose by about 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , declared GM on Friday .
In October , GM sold 42 660 pickolps Silverado and 16 503 pickolps .
GM shares rose by 1.4 % to $ 37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon .
A worker dies in concrete blocks
A construction worker is being killed in dozens of concrete blocks , on Thursday the day before midday in Montreal .
The tragedy occurred at 11 a.m. , on the Marquette street , near the intersection of the Beauwell street , in the Rosemont-La Pesser Patrie .
In all likelihood , work on the foundations has been going on there for some time .
A brick wall of foundations had been built in the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim came to the site to recover its tools .
I was travelling by car , and I saw the wall collapse with a large smokescreen , said Sylvain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I am landed and I have gone away from the big bricks that would be recovered .
There was only one part of his back , that is so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in 50 who worked for a coffer company .
There has been room for reanimation by emergency services , but without success .
He has not survived his serious injuries .
An inspector of the Health and Safety Commission has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
Obama \ u0027s Task of despair
I voted twice for President Obama .
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts to get through the Republican Party ’ s obstructionism .
obstructionism
The memory of Obama ’ s 2008
Nathiel P. Morris is student in the 2nd year of medicine in Harvard medicine .
I am reading a very sad book in recent days .
It is a book which I thought would encourage me during the morass of the second year of medicine and give me hope .
He is called “ The Auditty to Win , ” and that is the memory of Barack Obama ’ s presidential campaign in 2008 .
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening , and I am now , this book brings me back to the time when policies were inspired by millions of people and speeches could break you out .
The election ended with an overwhelming victory , and the presentations of news newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment .
My comrades cry for joy and my parents retained all the newspapers they found .
A young visionary team went to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama ’ s transition period before he took office in 2008 , he had 82 % in favour .
Then I am closing the book .
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening , it is like getting out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days of optimism , and they are like distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put Obama ’ s credit for great achievements , from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army , by the end of &quot; no &quot; or known , and the murder of Osama bin Laden .
Furthermore , I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But , having repeatedly defended Obama ’ s administration against my peers and my colleagues , I can no longer provide explanations .
I am on the verge of political despair .
Republican obstruction cannot explain foreign leaders , nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by drones .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the privacy of the Americans , or the indictment of whistleblowers that reveal the misdeeds of the government .
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , without trial , and the avoidance of public funding and the overshooting of permitted expenditure during the presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are &apos; more aggressive ... since the administration of Nixon &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified .
I do not know whether that is what I expected .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .
Of course , the electoral function is not predictable , because the opposition political party and events that occur by chance , such as the massacre in Newton , influence our public conversation .
However , all the examples I have listed seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what disturbs me most .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
Mitt Romney presented a confused , unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined .
I felt that Obama , who was elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections , would deliver the promises that have been made for so long .
Yet , while the favorable opinion index has plunged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I am not happy with the many promises that have been made .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses for Clinton to the Priurmayies of Pennsylvania .
At a post-campaign meeting , he told his team that they had to get back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause .
‘ I want us to focus on our talent ’ .
We must remember who we are .
We are now five years ago , Mr President , and I no longer agree with you .
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathiel Morris .
On Friday , at 3 p.m. , a violent collision between a moto and a car took place on the street of Retinne in Fléon .
The late , Jonathan , 26 years of Fléon , was not a cap .
Despite rapid relief , he died during this frontal collision .
Clive Palmer claims that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system .
The billionaire Member Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system .
The type-mining tycoon , which contests the payment of a carbon tax of $ 6M , has made this argument to try to remove questions about possible conflict .
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Abbott &apos;s girls were prepared to benefit personally from these policies .
&apos;It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because , if one of its daughters is pregnant , it will have a direct interest in whether or not it obtains leave &apos; , said Mr Palmer .
Two months after his election , the Electoral Commission officially stated that Mr Palmer won the headquarters of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes , after recounting .
Mr Palmer has put forward the idea of reshuffling the voting system to speed up the process .
The girls of Tony Abbott , Frees and Bridglet .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished ?
“ We need a better system , ” he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your coordination in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6.30 p.m. the next morning ?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper pens to score the ballot papers .
Is it in order to erase the result if someone does not agree ?
Today , having a paper paper seems extraordinary .
The Electoral Commission has studied possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand .
Mr Palmer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The exercise of public functions is a public service issue .
&quot; We are not looking for rewards , except for the reward of history , because we must serve the community at a critical moment , &quot; he added .
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservative Society in New York identified a new species of dauphin in the north of Australia .
Thickt Bauououx , responsible for the scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for the Conservation and Disability of Anievills and Milocations Marins ( OCEMMM ) , is for the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Does the discovery of this new species of dolphin to boast surprise you ?
That is good news , but it does not surprise me particularly .
In the past , the species have been described and identified on morphological , anatomic and geographical basis , today , the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in science of species classification .
Moreover , it is not possible for these advances in genetic engineering and biology to call into question the classification or belonging of a species of a kind , a family , or even an order .
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , morphists classified animals , based on the morphological differences between species .
Today , some of these rankings are called into question because of genetic progress .
Similarly , two species that are very close to morphologically have been distinguished by genetic engineering .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
A decade ago , the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-family : the Pacific dolphins and whales to the Atlantic .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is it an important discovery , as the Wildlife Conservative Society has said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability .
If this population were already known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only there .
Therefore , if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral epidemic or accidental catch occurs in the region , we could be dealing with the extinction of a species , rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered according to the number of people on Earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it will recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to the species species of origin , the population of the new species discovered , its stock has automatically become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals ?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homogeneous , open habitats , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species .
By contrast , more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which can eventually create new species .
We must be aware that the marine environment is the least well known environment .
We prefer to send robots to Mars , to know what is going on in the Mariannes sose , only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea .
More money is being spent on living in other planets than in marine research and it is high time that this changed .
RBSs suspension
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign-exchange division from two sources close to the dossier , which again shows that the global investigation of the suspicion of currency manipulation is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , such as UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators as part of the world ’ s largest financial market investigations , where $ 5.3 trillion is changing each day .
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation , which reflects the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate .
The bank , which refused to comment on suspensions , confirmed this month receiving requests for information from regulators .
&apos;The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we cooperate fully with the FFA and the other regulators &apos; , declared a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the dossier said that RBS had transmitted issues of email and instant messages , sent to and by a former trader , the British regulator , the Financial Condut Authority .
This trick , Richard Usher , left RBS in 2010 , and would have been suspended from the post of European DPMorgan trading official at JPMorgan .
Rohan Ramchandani , a European official trading officer in Citi , was set aside this week , while Matt Gardiner , a senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS , was suspended by Standard Chartered this week .
None of these traders have been prosecuted .
Mr Usher &apos;s case included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup , added sources close to the dossier .
UBS explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Finma , said that he was investigating suspicions of currency manipulation in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities – the European Commission , Finma , Swiss competition authority Wako , the FF , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – look at the allegations about bankers who have agreed to manipulate rates on the exchange market .
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators , have indicated sources close to the file .
The banks are looking at the instant messages and email sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts .
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth in investment banks in recent years , but has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits the opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast liquid exchange market , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A senior trader said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “ explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost . ”
The news came on the very day that the Cresaid Switzerland announced that it sent a trader working in its fund office negotiated on the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of $ 6M at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators .
‘ We are convinced that the trick has acted alone and that the case has been controlled ’ , has indicated a representative of the Cresaid Switzerland .
The investigation of Mayor Rb Ford
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking on the penk , Me Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen such a botched investigation .
Me Ruby said that the police had “ ignored or minimised ” the evidence against the mayor .
On Thursday , the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of Rob Ford , Alexander Lisi , aged 35 , and accused him of extortion with video .
Alexander Lisi , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the mayor .
The police have said that they have also observed this man who delivers a parcel to Rob Ford , indicating new court documents .
Mr Ruby described the fact that the police never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his or her home , or that he was listening to his phone , arguing that the police chief Bill Blair was aware of the fact that he did not act against the mayor .
Under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands , could have intercepted the vehicle of Rob Ford , arrest the mayor , and carry out a search - even without a mandate .
It could also have required an instant search mandate , if necessary .
The police chief has not commented , but his spokesman Mark Puwaste has described the words of Me Ruby as &apos; obvious and desperate attempt &apos; to press the media in a case that is not in any way relevant .
In the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &apos; reasonable grounds &apos; that could lead to a criminal accusation against the mayor .
European Stock Exchange
With the exception of London , the major European stock markets are falling on Friday in the middle of the sitting , plagued by some new companies with disappointing companies , while Wall-Street is expected to rise .
Moreover , investors remain cautious , because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could break down its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
Conversely , after inflation announced at 0.7 % for the eurozone as a whole , the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could relax its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street suggests that US actions should be opened up , after two consecutive consecutive sittings .
To the values , Renault ( -4.63 % ) recorded the strongest rebellion of CAC 40 , plagued by the warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday .
Royal Bank of Scotland ( -6.26 % ) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300 , having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a “ bad bank ” ( “ bad bank ” ) structure of $ 38 billion of the most risky assets .
For its part , Vodafar ( + 2.45 % ) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in reaction to press information that TT &amp; T is considering a possible takeover bid .
In the exchange market , speculations about the evolution of the ECB &apos;s monetary policy are going well , as John Hardy testifies , strategists in Saxo Bank .
The ECB &apos;s unique mandate has always been on inflation , so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
We are anticipating a great potential for a reduction in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its retreat against the US currency and has reached a lower of two weeks to $ 1.3517 .
The same conjecture supports the eurozone ’ s bond market .
Obama ’ s Sanct Court
The big victory for the Obama administration is that the US Supreme Court said today that Obama ’ s health-care reform law was constitutional .
By 5 votes against 4 , judges validated the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( law on the protection of patients and affordable care ) – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they have to pay a fine – and have said that it is constitutional under the government ’ s power of taxation .
The President of the Supreme Court , John Roberts , has joined the four most liberal members of the Court , while the judges Sclia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy have expressed their disagreement .
The Court also validated the other sections of the law of 2 700 pages and , furthermore , considered that the provision of the health reform law , which states that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered , otherwise it will lose all federal funding from the programme , was coercive in accordance with the constitution .
The procedure for blocking the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the first of 2012 , including the nominee Mitt Romney , are fiercely opposed to the law .
The former combatants in Mendon
At the heart of the graveyard of the Trabouquet , civil , religious and military authorities , as well as many patriotic associations , have , this Friday afternoon , paid tribute to the soldiers and defunct of all wars .
Doubts have been lodged in two of the three military careers of the cemetery by the Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities .
Agreement between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday 31 October 2013 in a violent cup on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday 1 November after the depletion of its fuel stocks announced the Palestinian Energy Authority .
A local commander of the Ezzedia al-Qassam Brigades , Khaled Abou Bakor , and another framework of the Hamas armed branch , Rabieh Barikeh , were killed by a shell shell in an Israeli army incursion into the east of Khan Younès , in the south of Gaza , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades , Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud , died when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel .
The Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli chasm and a blunder bulldozer have caused an incursion into a hundred metres within the territory before then withdrawing .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communiqué , a Hamas spokesperson , Sami Abu Zouhri , paid tribute to the four &apos; heroes &apos; and said that Israeli soldiers had died in confrontation .
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who have fallen by defending the territory in an incursion of Zan Younès occupations into Khan Younès .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier &apos; , threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave , which was discovered on 7 October and , according to the army , to &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel , specifying that the aim was to abduct Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communiqué .
In the course of the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive enslavement aimed at the forces of Tashal ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israel in northern Syria
&apos;This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians &apos; , also indicated the spokesman of the Peter Lerner army .
On the other hand , Israel has struck an air military base in north-west Syria , aimed at a missile cargo for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah , reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellite channel .
An American official confirmed an &apos; Israeli strike &apos; but did not give details of the target .
“ In the past , the targets were missiles transferred to Hizbollah , ” was it just added .
Israeli officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
Among the &apos; exclusive sources &apos; that she has not appointed , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that &apos; the bombing has targeted a cargo of solar missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon &apos; , in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces .
Earlier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Human Rights Observatory , reported on a number of explosions heard on Wednesday at the dawn in an air defence base at Sonar Jabé , near Lattacked , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation based on a network of militants and medical sources was unable to identify the origin of the explosions .
In black and white for Marie Chouinard , who is presenting to Danse Danse the two new group chargerapies : the first inspired by Henri Michelle ’ s encendants and poems , the second instilled by the famous soccano Gymnoperes ’ famous solos .
One evening that makes it possible to see all the prism of Chouinard , art in whites and black white .
A white screen serves as a fundamental wall .
On the carpet , which is so white , in the huge area of Theatribelt , is moving , profile and end like a line and clothes of black , a body .
On the screen , a ink of Henri Michelle is planned .
The body , simple , takes its form .
This form will be that of the whole coin : a boy of physical imitation of designs .
The dansers , fully clothed in black , only their hands and face face , are waiting on each side of the game , are rushing when the next round appears , embodies , they are coming out .
The black and white game of Henri Micheles is being played out by solos , in unison ( a mass that is solo ) , in large group of twelve solos where everyone is performing his sign .
We are thinking of &apos; Glory de morning &apos; , where , in solo , Chouinard carried out a series of chorestish tasks written on cartels , put online .
This is the same principle , a giant PowerPoint .
Here music is strong , permeated and electrical .
Energy is high , always fast .
There will be a caste when Carol Prior will take refuge under the dance carpet , to deliver , microphone in hand , without sobering or restraint , a share of the poem of Michelle , Moncorde , and monotone in the critic , and will continue by dancing .
And the music music and the sequence to resume .
This sound and energetic discharge , long , if it is possible , ends up attacking and sinking .
As is the regularity of the visual pace .
There are a few fine flashpoints - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those hair flowing or these black tissues that extend the lines .
But the chaggy approach lacks composition .
We have the impression that the chorus , instead of going to the Michelle meeting , has been forced to do so .
As a result , the bodies appear to be at the mercy of drawings .
The hats of Michelle , like Gestalt forms , are opening up a broader and gigantic imaginary than dancing , more porous .
Only the end , in negative terms , with its dancing dansers hasn with a stroboopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre , is hitting the magic .
The public loved , the reception was warm .
The Gymneworks , after the enact , is richer .
The scene is partly muted , dansts and piano are covered by tissues , like furniture in a neglected house .
In the piano , danssers stood for the party .
Their untouchables in music , touching , give real fragility .
On the scene , the couples , in loathsome loads , very senseless , even eroded couples .
Working groups , small solos of transitions , which are moving , shocking , writing is less binary .
There are buffers , also familiar with Chouinard , with the red nose , with highly polarized men and women .
The ambears are carnasers , fleeing or players .
Cheap , ries , and scries are virtually the archaic , grandiose , and ludicrous body of cooked bodies .
But the coin is taking its real flight after the salvation .
A clown is on the scene when the public leaves .
Here , everything is being allowed : the fourth wall falls , the universe is superseded , the dormant dwellers , descend among the spectators , glossy , smother , fade , play applause , play the brunt of a savagely calculated mess .
Happy and madness transpires , and it is Chouinard &apos;s art to contaminate the public .
Google , Samsung and Huawei
The group with thousands of former Nortel patents has begun an avalanche of legal proceedings in the field of patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that it hairly hooked at the auction of patents that took place after the collapse of Nortel .
Rockstar , the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $ 4.5 trillion , lodged a complaint against Samsung Electrtrics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for a patent breach before the US Court of Justice in Texas .
Rokstar is held jointly by Apple , Microsoft , Blackberry , Ericsson and Sony .
Google is accused of violating seven patents .
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising in connection with Internet research terms , have indicated the conclusions of the trial , which is the heart of Google ’ s work .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rokstar .
Samsung , Huawei , and HTC make telephones operating under Google ’ s Androde operating system , which has fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft products .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of $ 900 million for Nortel patents .
Google has increased its offer on several occasions , finally proposing $ 4.4 .
After losing Nortel patents in the face of Rokstar , Google won Motorola Moility for $ 12.5 trillion , a market based on Motorola ’ s patent library .
“ Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at auction , Google violated and continues to violate the patents , ” indicated the trial ’ s conclusions .
Rockstar calls for greater damage and interest against Google , because it claims that Google ’ s patent violation is stubbornly stubborn , according to the complainant .
Exploitation of a house in Gesves
The grandmother would have opened a cigarette in a gas leak .
The explosion of a housing in Gesve , which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning , a grandmother of 52 and her 5-year grandson , is due to a gas leak from a defective water driver , indicated on Friday evening the replacement of the King of the King .
The expert sent out by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental .
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a flight and an accumulation of gas .
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still committed .
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is being burnt down .
The small boy who was in his grandfather and his companion was on his side and was burnt slightly .
&quot; The two victims were inundated and at long last conditioned on the ground before being taken over to the Liège of Liège , which was in the helicopter , in ambulance , &quot; made the quagmire José Paulet , descended at the scene .
The grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
Sain and except , he was able to join the floor by the staple that remained intact , while the retreat from the house was completely destroyed .
The grandfather and the tenants of the neighbouring house , who are weakened by the explosion , have been relaxed by the President of the CAPAS .
The fire brigade in Anne and Namur and the Arts police have intervened .
The civil protection of Crisna has stabilised both buildings .
Egypt ’ s first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi has lent the investiture , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political disputes in Egypt .
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “ new Egypt ” when he lent his inauguration to the presidency , thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier .
In his investiture before the Constitutional Court , Mr Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago .
He was sworn in front of the 18 judges on the black rock of the Court whose building on the Nil was built to look like an Egyptian temple .
“ We want a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said President Morsi during the formal ceremony broadcast directly on public television .
“ Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” explained Mr Morsi , a 60-year-old engineer in the United States , coming from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal and hard-pressed organization of successive governments .
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours , a local hour , followed by a small convoy .
Only a few hundred fans had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and , moving away from the President of Mubarak &apos;s presidency , the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy on the very crowded streets connecting the centre-town to the south .
In view of the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ rescue wheel ” , its personal prestige has increased considerably since its victory and its Friday speech in which it tried to present itself as the candidate not only of the Islamists , but of all those who want to end the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak .
“ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” declared Mohamed Morsi , in blue and white costume , to the judges in the hallmark of bickery in which he lent oath .
Later , Mr Morsi visited the Cairo University in which he gave his inauguration speech .
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem when he was standing in the garden .
The Marechal Hussein Tantayes attended the ceremony .
When he arrived , he was greeted by the &apos; people and the army , hand in hand ... &apos; , engendered by thousands of people gathered in the great hire of university .
Based on 1908 and the former bastion of secular education , Cairo ’ s university became a stranger of Islamist student groups in the 1970 ’ s .
Mr Morsi made a symbolic server on Friday in Tahrir Square , where the uprising that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian regime last year , and vowed to recover the presidential powers whose military council , which replaced the former president , has stripped him .
But , by agreeing to formally lend to the Court , rather than to Parliament as it is used , he is inciting the military ’ s will by showing that the power struggle is not over .
Mr Morsi ’ s speech in Tahrir Square accompanied spectacular populist gestures .
The US Shutdown
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October , showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers , five of the six most important performing performance performance .
The three major Detroit manufacturers are growing at two figures compared with October 2012 , but only General Motors has done better than expected .
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million sales at an annualized rate and corrected seasonal variations , but the market was at 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas , Morgan Stanley .
In a note to the bank &apos;s customers , he believes that this slight brake is primarily due to &apos; the government shutdown and its impact on the consumer &apos;s sense of feeling in the first half of the month &apos; .
Nevertheless , GM has reported that it is about 16 % of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles , compared to 211 563 , expected by consensus .
The four brands of the group have seen their commercial performance improved compared with October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups , has seen its sales increase by 14 % over a year to 191 985 vehicles , while the consensus expected 194 301 .
For its part , Chrysler , controlled by Fiat , announced an 11 % increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles , compared to 143 536 .
Toyota and Nissan also have lower sales , despite increases over a year of 8.8 % and 14.2 % respectively .
At the New York Stock Exchange , GM action was 1.4 % at 16.35 GMT , while Ford gave up 1.1 % .
Renault
Renault accuses Friday of the strongest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that he had reduced his annual net profit forecast by almost 20 % , reporting traders .
Nissan , who had to carry out such a review , also announced a reshuffle of his direction .
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by &apos; learning &apos; .
&apos;This is clearly the wake-up call of Nissan &apos; , says a head of the trader of a Paris broker .
Under the Renault Nissan alliance , Renault holds 43.4 % of Nissan capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of French , according to the Nissan website .
Greece
Two people were killed and another was injured on Friday evening by the fire fired by two people who were on the verge of a moto who went to a local leader of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn in the West suburbs of Athens , have learned from police sources .
The police were not at present in a position to give information about the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation .
Some Greek media reported that members of Aube Dawn had argued that the victims were local guards .
The injured person immediately became hospitalised , according to the same source .
policemen of the anti-terrorist service have been sent out on the central avenue of the Dutch suburb of Iraq , where the incident took place and closed the area .
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six de Aube Dawn , including the leader and founder of the party , for participation in &apos; a criminal organisation &apos; in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members .
Scott Brown ’ s rejected
Mr Brown , the captain of Celtic Glasgow , has seen his rejected call and will be suspended for the next two matches of League Chairs of his club , against Ajax and AC Milan .
Examed against the Barça for a blow to Nymar , the Scottish environment has seen its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA .
In a communiqué , his club said &apos; very disappointed &apos; , believing that his appeal was entirely justified .
Nearly 50 000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province , shortly after midday on Friday , due to the violent winds affecting many regions along the St Laurent river .
The most affected sectors are the Laurentin , with 15 042 subscribers in the black , the Montereaux with 13 464 and the Uighur with 8642 .
The great region of Montreal also has a lot of banners with almost 7,000 private homes in the metropolis and Laval .
You thought that the travel agencies were in the past because of the Internet ?
It seems to be a reversal of the trend .
Society has revised its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results through holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying profit on the whole of the year between $ 325 and $ 340 million before taxes , compared to a previous forecast of 305 to 315 .
If current forecasts are reached , it will represent 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record profits of 290.4 M in 2011 / 12 .
The Director-General , Graham Turner , said that Flight Centre had achieved 8 % of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly with regard to travel other than business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom .
“ Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are well on the way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before deducting interest and taxes , ” he said .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits .
In Australia , the recreational travel sector has rekindled during the second half of the year , which has made it possible to compensate for a light-touch domestic trade market .
Similarly in the United Kingdom , the Flight Centre travel sector in Flight Centre has produced good results , while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States has recovered its losses in the first half of the year , when seasonal demand is lower and should benefit from the entire financial year for the third time running .
The Flight Centre ’ s actions rose by 3 cents to $ 38.20 yesterday .
There is an unknown hotel of the Cairo pyramid .
Typical unknown invoices opened the fire this Friday on a hotel close to the Cairo pyramid in Egypt without victims , as a result of an apparent dispute with redundant workers .
The assailants took flight , made the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , the Police General Abdel Lative , clear .
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has been receiving almost no tourist ever since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses the protests of his supporters in blood .
Schools
Within the framework of English literature , pupils will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare , a nineteenth-century novel , a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work of 1914 .
The examination will also present &apos; new texts &apos; to encourage a more diverse reading .
A combination of literature and English language will be abolished .
From 2015 , pupils will have to pass an independent GCSE , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education will have to publish its new English and male programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , Ofqual , the regulator of examinations , will reveal a reshuffle of the structure of the GCSE , with a new rating system and less courses .
Speaking during the summer , Michael Gove , Minister of Education , said that there was a “ broad consensus on the need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence , ” insisting that the CSC would be “ more stimulating , more ambitious , and more rigorous . ”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mths ( 116 hours per year , 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
By comparison , Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year , and Singapore students make about 138 hours .
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to mths , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep mths – as well as greater emphasis on matters in international rankings – would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours .
The programme will focus more on “ real world problems , ” including financial mathematics .
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that state , and in full question of the right to abortion , will be able to enter into force .
A octogenaire hosts children with a gun to the Mary for Hallween

His weapon was seized .
The former Gestapo leader buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller , who disappeared at the end of the Second World War and never found his trace , was in fact buried in a common mass graveyard of a Berlin Jewish cemetery , affirms the leader of the Memorial of German Resistance , Professor Johannes Tuchel , in Bild .
Müller did not survive the end of the war .
&apos;His body was buried in 1945 in a joint mass graveyard of Berlin-Mitte &apos;s Jewish cemetery &apos; , he assured every day of great rabies on the basis of archive documents .
This revelation , 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler , would respond to one of the great enigma of the post-War War .
The German secret services , the BND , ensured that in the summer of 1949 Müller was in Karlovy Vary , in Czechoslovakia , according to a document obtained by Bild .
The secret services were completely wrong .
“ From August 1945 , Müller ’ s body was found in a provisional grave near the former Ministry of the Reich of the Reich by a commander , according to Mr Tuchel .
It was &apos; a uniform uniform &apos; .
“ In the left of the left , among other things , there was a photo . ”
Bild also publishes a document from the maiden of the district of Mitte in Berlin that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the neighbourhood .
The President of the Central Council of Germany , Dieter Gaumann , declared himself shocked by this revelation .
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge amount of bad taste .
&quot; The memory of the victims is grossly crowded , &quot; has been rescued in the newspaper .
Heinrich Müller is among the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been caught .
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942 , which decided on the &apos; final solution &apos; and , in particular , led under his orders Adolf Eichmann , responsible for the &apos; logistics &apos; of the extermination of Jews , sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962 .

Dr. Georges Bowle
Dr. Bowle and his team
There are not many doctors in this West African country , just 1 for 5 000 inhabitants .
Vote here or through your mobile machinery
Dr Georges Bwle is one of the 10 CNN of the year 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the 10 other hero heroes , to elect “ Hannos CNN of the year . ”
That person will receive $ 250,000 in order to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Georges Bowle watched her sick father alternating periods of conscience and conscience and travelling to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James Bwle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaouné , the capital of Cameroon .
At the beginning , he had only a broken arm , but he contracted a infection that spread to his brain , creating a haematomy that he was going to carry the rest of his life .
“ There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bowle .
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money .
Instead , Dr. Bwle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals , so that he obtains any treatment he could benefit from .
‘ It is not easy ’ , adding Mr Bwle .
You can leave the house at 5 : you are going to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they are waiting for too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr Bwle &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cameroon , there are only 1 doctors for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By comparison , the ratio in the United States is 1 doctors for 413 inhabitants .
Even if they could see a doctor , many Cameroon could not pay for consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three-quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditure is carried out in the private sector .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; explained Dr Bwle .
Because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
Having seen his father and many of his compatriots suffer , Dr Bwle was determined to try to change things .
Dr Georges Bowle and his team of volunteers carried out more than 700 surgical acts free of charge over the past year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoudé .
And it created a non-profit-making humanitarian association , SACOVE , which goes to rural areas during weekends to provide free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped almost 32 000 people .
Nearly all Fridays , with 30 people , are marching into petles after setting medical equipment on the roof and going through difficult land to go to villages that need help most .
The chance does not always follow .
They have often had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or empty ways .
But when they arrive , they are received as heroes : the community is holding a festival , chant , and dancing and offering them the best available housing .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and Dr. Bwle – with his great smile and dried energy – is more than happy to join the festivities .
The next morning , the team starts receiving hundreds of patients .
‘ We get 500 people on each visit ’ , said Mr Bowle .
Sometimes they live at 60 km of the village , and they come to foot .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is provided .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive crutches , lunches collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
On the evening , the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anaesthetic .
The operations are generally carried out in a school , a maiden or a house ; after the intervention , the patient is standing up and travelling to the awakening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the Electrole Group , the operation room and the sterilisation of equipment , Dr Bwle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
It is a rhythm rhythm , but village musicians usually help the team to remain motivated .
&apos;They are knocking on buffers every night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work &apos; , explained Mr Bowle .
On Sunday the team returns to city , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , made up of Cameroon doctors and medical students , carried out 700 surgical acts free of charge over the last year , and it knows that their presence can make the difference for those who are helping them .
A man has explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a herd would allow him to work again .
&apos;This will change my future and that of my family &apos; .
In addition to having this mobile hospital living and working like surgery in hospital , Dr Bwle is also working night in private medical firms around Yaoudé .
It is this second job , it says , which finances 60 % of its association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
“ I don ’ t know when he sleep , ” he said , Karet O &apos;Malley , a medical student in the second year of Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer within the Drit Bowle group .
It is still in hospital or in the process of trying to find money for its association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
For medical students and nurses like the United States and Europe who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bowle in his missions , it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home .
“ We have been able to take part in operations to help raise blood or pass the instruments to Dr Bwle , ” explained Miss O &apos;Malley .
That is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine in the second year .
Voluntary students generally pay their journey to Cameroon , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
But once in Yaoundé , their pensions , transportation , and education are borne by Dr Bowle .
“ It is a hero , there is no doubt ” , said Karet O &apos;Malley .
He gives his life for that association , and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not close to extinction .
For Dr Bwle , the relatively constant workload is not a problem .
Helping others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy .
‘ I am so happy when I do this work ’ added Mr Bowle .
I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
Making people laugh and relieving pain is the reason that leads me to do that .
Take the SACOVE site to see how you can help .
Pierre Nora
The academics have long painted to define and place Pierre Nora .
Professor in amphires and in the courts of course ?
Without doubt , but by underlining its weakness for the roads , Sciences-Po , the Utudes of Studes .
Around the works of others in his office in the Gaston-Gallimard street ?
Indeed , while ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher .
Herry at the helm of the French Academy ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sacrosanct should not replace the real holy oil , that of the theory , which has happened .
They have willingly acknowledged in him a great , animator and federator of their work , but that he has been unwilling to produce it himself .
To this uncertain image , the monument of the “ Live memory ” , to which he attached his name , also contributed .
The bad languages have been able to see it as a huge market for chips , presented by an intelligent commentator , with a vibrant eye and leudition , but it is incurring .
The two works published by Nora nearly two years ago have already established that the person who was going for not writing had many and well written .
The book that is now to be brought to justice should be brought to justice .
Once again , however , there is the temptation of ubiquity , of the intellectual vagmire , of the jubilation that has been placed on the sidelines of one subject .
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a fine title will bring the rocky to a single passion : to discover the nod of French identity .
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity ?
Identity : this is a concern of time .
We have been collectively invited to give a definition .
But , in the pervasive spirit of our then leaders , French identity was a intimate essence .
Accidents should only be deployed , and the case , Jacobinism , has been forced upon the prefects and the subprets , authorised interpreters .
There is no other way to go .
It is not a heir to eternal blindness , it is refusing to define it .
Analysts concerned about a familiar stranglehold , he is in a forest of symbols , arrested at every step by a form of rebus , tormented by irritating issues .
Who is born of the company itself : why , in a country which has been so permanently installed in its borders , which was previously chartered and firmly established , will these dramatic calls for unity be heard ?
They are not so pressing , suggesting Pierre Nora , to conjure up the disorder caused by the discord of French history .
Francs and Gaulaws , Armagnacis and Bourguignons , Catholics and Protestants : the forces of division here are very old .
The most emblematic of these is , of course , the one that breaks down national history .
From the earthquake , the French have two stories , and they have two nations , one monarchic , the other revolutionary .
The second was the death of the first , but it did not succeed in denying it ; instead , it was concerned about the fact that it would be sacred and that it was all the more greedy of unity and indivisibility that it had cut its head in the face of the obvious and powerful incarnation .
And , from here , a nation invinciably binary , shared between left and right , secularism and Catholicism , adulteration and hatred of the revolution .
In order to make this peculiarity of French identity , nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexaggerone , so that Pierre Nora may be the heart of his book .
Because America and France have both made a revolution , drafted a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
But the American caping does more to highlight what is of our own .
There , the men who had left their Ancien Region in England and who no longer care about it .
Here , the crowded men of an indigenous , indigenous and indigenous Ancien are all the more radical .
This is a consensual revolution when it sowed the drama and trust .
Here , the founding fathers who are still honored , and here revolutionary ancestors , whose models are hardly being developed , and who have been killed .
This is an institutional constancy , and here a cascade of constitutions , as many mistakes to be made and trials to be resumed .
France , France ,
There was , however , a time when the French believed that they could recoup the teeth of their history and overcome the curse of the figure two .
In the Third Republic , which is central and creative , Pierre Nora has shown great interest and even tenure : saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching the schoolchildren of everything in the former France , obscured by modern France , and offering them a unified version of their history .
However , this peaceful identity had only a time .
Once again , this is in the debate , driven by immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of resonative minorities , absorbed in the European area .
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is going and the cautious outline of France that has come .
With a premium , the portrait of the historian , which should reserve some surprises .
It is discovered that the shirt was a cap .
The man of the multiple cuosities was , rather obsessive , around the same idea .
The manure of manure was at the centre of the centre .
And the person who , over a half-century ago , tabled a subject on the idea of a nation , but had taken away from the original exercise of the theory , we are entrusting ourselves , cum grano salim , which he will have done .
Of course , in a less mature , fragmented and subtle form .
But let us not deceive ourselves , just as binding .
For much more than the figure imposed on the university curriculum , this is a matter of the internal need for a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &apos; Return is quite complex to manage &apos; .
Enlifted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his &apos; Antenne 2 &apos; team to filter a Hizbollah demonstration , the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987 .
Retreaty since 2008 , in 2004 , he took part in the creation of the so-called &apos; World Law for the hostages &apos; , which he has presided over for several years .
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages of Aqmi ( al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) Daniel Larbe , Thierry Dol , Pierre Lega and Marc Fréet were released on Tuesday .
After medical examinations at the Val-bride military hospital on Wednesday afternoon , they have been able to return to their families since then .
And gradually try to take up the course of their lives .
&apos;The New Observer &apos; questioned Jean-Louis Normandiin , 62 years old , which was , since 2008 , the President of the &apos; World Offices of the World &apos; .
From the evening of your release you were on the 20th of &apos; Antenne 2 &apos; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
Particularly in Beirut .
When I am released I find myself in the coffer of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auca .
He tells me &apos; we are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and I say that we can still be killed .
We are very excited , but also very tense .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They are putting us on the board .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then we come to the Summerland hotel site where the press is present .
The French are leading us to the French Embassy .
It is time for the first coups to parents , the family , friends , the press ...
I remember I took a bath for an hour .
And having dinned to the French Embassy .
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani .
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate ourselves to the airport in Larnaaca in Cyprus .
With the helicopter there is a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara , where Pasqua is concerned .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
We are getting to Orly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
That is a bit brutal .
There is an incredible scrap .
And many media .
When I left there were three television channels .
I have come back and there is full .
The descent from the flight to the plane , the reins with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely emotional .
Between the airport and in my home , many motorcycles follow our car which Rcuscuss leads .
The motorists are getting the quarrel to make photos and go to my home where I have to do a little bit to prevent some of them from going .
The media pressure is enormous .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it .
We are going out of a hole and we are suddenly in the media .
It is rather complicated , somewhat violent , rather complex to manage .
But we have done the hardest .
I am at the same time , and the next day I am on television .
Then there is a kind of realignment to life , very slowly , for one or two months that are a bit like holiday .
How did medical examinations and debriefing DGSE go ?
I had the right to first medical control in Corsica .
The rest has been done in the Val-brigade , following my return : radio , gender exams , and a psychiatrist .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that we can count on him , to remind him of it if need be , that we are not handed over to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostages .
That was logical .
It did not embarrass me .
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger ?
I am listening to what is said .
The debate on ransom in particular .
Some things irritate me , others less .
I am trying to bring the issues of my past to the fore as a hostage and as chairman of the &apos; ODA &apos; association , which allows me to distance myself , and I think it is much more interesting to talk about it .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resilience .
Above all , I am fighting , along with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostage .
I think there is a problem with semantics .
We must call for hostages &apos; taking hostages &apos; - which is most of the time - and allowing the hostages to have access to justice , to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in compassion , in emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice ?
A court in The Hague is doing this .
Why do you not tell the hostage-takers &apos; you have flouted the rules of war , such as those of all the Geneva Conventions , you are going to bring you to justice ? &apos;
It seems to me , however , that this is justified , legitimate and that common sense is being struck .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and I am shocked .
That is my main fight .
Egypt ’ s Islamists
The anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists is growing .
Two days before the trial of the deposed President Mohamed Morsi , they took to the streets .
mobilisation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country &apos;s first democratically elected president .
It is not a trial that highlights the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s activist .
Until now , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents .
It is not a trial , it is a farce .
President Morsi ’ s trial is a false case against a pro-Morsi case , and he is supposed to make Sisi judge , not the opposite .
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres in Raaba , the Nahda massacres , and the massacre of the Republican Guard .
Sisi is a liar and a traitor .
There have been clashes in Alexandria , the police used tear gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo police academy , where Mohamed Morsi will be judged .
Hagel reproaches 9 US States to violate homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognised homosexual marriage , &apos; all military spouses have the right to an identity card of the Department of Defense and to the benefits coming with &apos; , reminded the Minister in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League in the fight against anti-Semitism .
&apos;But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex same-sex workers .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided on these bases , or access their shops .
The Secretary of Defense has said that he has ordered the head of the National Guard , General Frank Grass , to ensure that the federal law is implemented .
The frontloading of the nine states started by Texas , which refuses to implement these benefits on the establishment of the Texal National Guard , due to a conflict between the text of the text and the Federal Law on homosexual marriage .
It was joined in its refusal by Indiana , Georgia , Florida , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , South Caroline and Western Virginia , according to a senior defence officer .
The Pentagon believes the population concerned with recognition of homosexual marriage to around 5600 active people , 17 000 by including the National Guard , reserve and pensioners .

Only 10 years ago , he won his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year , and he does not like anything so much as to go back to competitors who exceed three heads .
The Mayor of Toronto hunting the question about a drug case
In Canada , the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of indulging in several media .
A video handed to justice seems to support these suspicions .
The person concerned , Rob Ford , has always denied that he has consumed a penny , while recognising that he has a pennabis pensioner .
On Thursday , he expelled several journalists from his property .
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment .
A case of rabies detected in the Val-Oise Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies was detected in a chaton in the Val-d &apos;Oise , obviously of foreign origin , while France is unscathed from indigenous cases since 2001 .
The chaton was found on 25 October in Argenl and he died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of rabies has been confirmed by the Paster Institute .
&apos;An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this chaton between 8 October and 28 October including &apos; precisely the ministries of health and agriculture .
&apos;Five people who have been in contact with the chaton have already been identified &apos; and have received preventive treatment .
&apos;Come on man , the preventive treatment of human rabies , administered after contact with the pig animal , but before the symptoms appeared , is very effective &apos; , precise the communiqué .
The ministries are now calling for people who would have been dead , raped , greed , or lacked a mud or a skin damaged by this chaton or whose animal would have been in contact with this chaton between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11 , 0.06.95 , between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November .
&apos;France has been unscathed since 2001 , this chaton or the mother have been imported from another country , not unscathed &apos; , according to the communiqué .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of &apos; indigenous &apos; rabies recorded back in December 1998 on a fox and that &apos; France is officially declared unscathed from this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) &apos; .
A case of rabies on an illegally imported chicken in Gambia was recorded in 2008 .
&apos;rabies is a deadly disease if it is not dealt with in time &apos; , reminds ministries and is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama ’ s Health Return
Under an avalanche of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday on his unmistakable and often repeated promise that “ if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it . ”
After hundreds of thousands of people have received opinions from their providers , the Republicans have criticised the President over the last few days by accusing him of deceiving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
“ The vast majority of people with a health insurance that suits them can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Boston .
On the subject of what he calls “ a rise in the current situation ” about the terminations , President Obama has encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new market insurance .
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health systems for the same price , or even less expensive than expected .
“ You will win , ” he said .
The Administration has announced that one should not be surprised at the fact that the 5 % of the population who take their own insurance are being forced to change the system because their cover does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act .
‘ Let me address the Americans directly : you deserve better ’ , said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Sebelius , who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , said that the launch of the online market in October had failed &apos; lamentably &apos; .
‘ I am as frustrated and irritated as anyone ’ , she added .
I look forward to regaining your confidence .
It was a Kathleen Sebelius exasperated , who made this sentence , when she believed her microphone cut off , addressing a assistant sitting behind her at the session of the House yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with Billly Long , the Republican representative of the Missouri , to know whether she should join the Obamacare .
For more than three hours , Billly Long has repeatedly urged Mrs Sebelius why “ the architect of the Affordable Care Act ” had not voluntarily relinquished the government ’ s sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthCare.gov , which now boasts millions of Americans .
Vote
The happy election , Jake Vte Prekop , combined the colours of the car mark and the German flag , while at the same time including the notions of speed and heat at the level of the runway .
The German Sea Sebastian Vetel , four World Cup championships of Formula 1 , took over for the free trials of Abu Dhabi &apos;s Grand Prix on Friday a special cap whose design was achieved by a Mexican fake of 21 years .
That has been the choice of 1 500 drawn from all over the world , as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors , a car mark , its stays .
He has been invited to follow the GP de Abu Dhabi , with a friend , and can therefore look closely at the German champion , on the runway and in his song .
That was the last item on Friday and Saturday .
He is likely to have another special cap on Sunday for the race to mark his 4th consecutive global title .
A Han in Aubervia
Let us not deceive ourselves .
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermine , his founder , the suburbs of the suburbs , is not only directed at bands .
I have chosen a map of France as a logo .
When I speak of suburbs , I address all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , its draft , presented on Thursday at the press conference in its own home of Aubervilic , was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism , this great cultural pot which characterises the areas above all .
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multiculturalism .
Abdel-Malik Djermine , 50 years , a territorial attaché , is now claiming to be &apos; 100 % apolitical &apos; even though it has not always been neutral .
In 2002 , together with Jean-Pierre Chevenement , he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the equality values that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if the right-wing people are prepared to support me , I will also listen to them .
There are only extremist parties that I am talking about .
In addition to multiculturalism , Abdel-Malik Djermune has built up his programme - Internet-based - on the basis of many topics that are supposed to speak to people in suburbs , especially young people : the right to vote for foreigners , legalisation of cannabis , the civil majority of 16 years , the rehabilitation of the function of the guardian of buildings ...
It remains to be found for candidates to form lists and to defend its ideas on the political scene , &apos; for the 2014 municipal elections , this is likely to be fair , recognise &apos; .
It is a problem of time and money .
The suburbs Party should , after all , be represented in Auberviv through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities .
Abdel-Malik Djermne ensures that seven heads of the list in metropolitan France and Martinique are already in place .
&apos;And the mails of support I have received since yesterday do not all come from suburbs &apos; .
John Kerry admitted , unprecedented , that American espionage “ had gone too far . ”
John Kerry has indicated a weakening of the US ’ s defensive attitude to his surveillance programs , which , without a precedent , has been unprecedented , and , on several occasions , spying “ had gone too far . ”
Secretary of State has also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , has governed “ automatic pilot ” when a series of inflammatory revelations of the whistle-blowing Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities came into being .
The leaks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video , Mr Kerry said : &apos; There is no doubt that the President , myself and other members of the government have taken on board certain things in an automatic pilot because we had the opportunity , from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War , and then of course on 11 September . &apos;
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had gone beyond the bounds , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : “ In some cases , it has gone too far . ”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &apos; We live in a new world where people are prepared to get rid of . &apos;
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , explode them and attack governments .
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act ?
We have prevented aircraft from falling , buildings exploded and people are being murdered because we have been able to read the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to respond to the concerns about the alleged American espionage affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States , which explained on Thursday the chairman of the Senate ’ s Subcommittee on European Affairs .
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken before the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made about the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations because of the sense of frustration that the National Security Agency has aroused .
“ It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain alongside us in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism , ” declared Murphy , a democrat serving his first term , and Chairman of the US Senate ’ s Subcommittee on European Affairs in an interview from Washington .
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes .
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe , which has damaged relations with some of the United States &apos; allies , but the director of the agency said this week that this was not true and that it was a misunderstanding because it was a misunderstanding that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other revelations have reported documents issued by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and that of 34 other heads of state .
The director of the intelligence services , James Clarler , justified the espionage of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice on both sides .
In this tumult atmosphere , Murphy has indicated that his office is organising a congress of Congress , which should take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and two chambers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days .
He said that the route remains to be defined .
Murphy said that the purpose of this journey was to improve relations , but also to show &apos; affective firmness &apos; .
He has explained that European Heads of State must be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes that they themselves have been applying for years .
‘ We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only people in the world to be spying , said Murphy .
In the meantime , Mr Kerry has planned to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .
The London Stock Exchange ended on Thursday , plagued by Shell ’ s poor performance , and following the Fed ’ s announcement that its support for the economy should be maintained as planned .
An Australian
A twenty-year-old Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in Phuket for allegedly claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver has appealed to the judgment and has been put on trial .
Stelife Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Court of Province on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver , accompanied by two other men who controlled him , attacked him early on Sunday 10 June .
However , video recordings later revealed that it was returned to its hotel safely after being separated from its small Australian friend .
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted that she invented the history of all parts .
It was held in a cell of the local commission before the court hearing .
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in the periphery of Phuket rather than in a prison for women .
It is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of rugby Peter Tunks , who has appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help her daughter .
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the entire family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted it to return to Australia .
“ We have , of course , experienced an anguish moment , but we hope to bring it back to the house safely as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .
Bamford appealed to the judgment and was put on trial after a cap of 50 000 baits was paid .
In Australia , the press said that , in the meantime , it was on holiday in the region of Krabi , southern Thailand .
Thai judicial sources have indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket , but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence that could go up to two years imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison .
However , after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith , an Australian voyage , Thailand could also seek to restore its damaged image to tourists , which could lead to an acquittal .
The French police will stop the supporters of Andersson from the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Paris Saint Germant , which was set on Tuesday , sent Marie Verbeke , the spokesman for the police area from Brussels to noon on Friday .
The Belgian supporters of the SSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the SSCA .
&apos;The bus convoy will be escorted by the police since a former border post from Rekem to the PSG stage &apos; , passed the spokesman .
It will be the same for return .
&quot; If other fans had a intention to go to Paris by other means , French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even to the garden guards , which has still announced Marie Verbeke .
Moving together in French , the challenge of the Margerite--Bourgeys
At the Margerite--Bourgeys school committee 62 % of pupils have a mother tongue other than French .
A year ago , this was the reason for consultation with parents , pupils , teachers and members of education staff , to reflect on how to better integrate pupils who live together between several cultures .
The school committee has just revealed its vision of &apos; Liver as a whole in French &apos; .
The Vision diversity organism has been around for a year in schools to help pupils of all origins to find common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language .
The discovery of neighbourhoods , our architecture , our places are benchmarks .
Large names of writers , artists , whether they are in strain or come from elsewhere .
Who are our builders ?
Thus , we are creating projects so that they can identify with everything , explains the President of Vision diversity , Aida Kamar .
Michel Varen , the New World Institute , identified several challenges for the school committee .
&apos;On the transmission , for example , of what is known as the quégégé culture , the feeling of belonging , support for staff in the transformations that we are living through , within the student client &apos; .
The Margerite--Bourgeys Committee has set up a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who , too , sometimes come from elsewhere .
Rachida Azouz , the University of Montreal , will be the scientific director .
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context , a queue .
&apos;Different pedagogical strategies , that is the real need &apos; , summarises it .
Research will cover the inclusion of all its angles : linguistic , school , social and cultural .
