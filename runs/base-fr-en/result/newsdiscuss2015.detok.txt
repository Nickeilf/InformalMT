UKIP, who reject those who are living with HIV, are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this in mind, it responds yes when the interviewing asks specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First of all, you use specious arguments and then discredit them with barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind the intolerant hypocrites who think that all is due.
I think you are using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing divide, does not exist practically.
I believe that this is what is called democracy.
No one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a torch is proof of this.
Yes, therefore, take the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it did just comment on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I do not think you know what a specious argument is.
You know nothing about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
The Farage sentence was a great surprise, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He has made absolutely no homophobic remark.
You will have to get you back.
I am not of course where you want to come, but I imagine you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like.
This is so rare because, unlike Farage and his divided followers of Thatcher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of God, not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, not.
Ultimately, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis in the austerity period, nothing will be done.
To see almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
In Ireland, we were told that the TBRE, the EUROPE, has been booming.
We have seen the follow-up!
This has been suggested.
There is an attempt to make the impression that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a NUUVUU MIRACE MIROMIEU is now taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, which is impotent on the lowest social society in Europe, a flexible work march, an ongoing emigration.
This is not what the Poles have to say.
In the 1980 ’ s of the twentieth siecle, the irrelevance of one of the poorest countries of the Europa Union, with the Portuguese in view of a constant perimeter, without the infants, is always better than it was.
The Grey was ahead.
The fact that their development is not a long peace river is due to the recent disclosures.
Europe's lowest impots?
That is not true!
Latvia has an impot rate of 0% on companies.
Now there is hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the impots paid by the multinationals.
According to a report in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France.
Only small and medium-sized enterprises are paying their own.
Now I can confirm that the road trail has become endemic, and there are new cars (and chere) all of the street, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily sheep since the entry.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Do not worry, I am sure that the comments will soon get bogged down.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhal Astra is involved in a cup on A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe that Mr O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few booms and raids on the old will soon be forgotten.
Having said that, I am voting with him next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these people once they have been reduced.
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that they were willing to provide?
But without this kind of Irish business you could not afford to go on holiday, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer the airline to propose a good service.
No, but it is Ryanair, so they can be very happy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic tariff have only to take on themselves, etc.
That is quite transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be happy with the additional costs of this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether we will have to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of air traffic controllers in the airport.
Passengers have been placed in another plane in less than an hour, they have no right to compensation.
It is a long time to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to British Airways, which takes the English SIS in Syria, not as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, the street of the Frankssis, the Marsh is a large part of the world, and is literally a group of people.
People do not come into a mass for the quality of restaurants (most of them) or for the magazine Salon in the Blancs-Mantees area (hyper-intellectual and slightly dust).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and that the area is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners who spend...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue of the Franco Bourgeis, where the shops are opened the Sunday world, with 50% of tourists.
This!
The only argument that seems to me to be admissible is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they are buying a tax.
The tourist areas lose a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, exploited on the Sunday, can lower prices.
Dominical rest is a right which, except exceptions, benefits employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the labour code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy, nor, indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has any competence to reform the labour code.
Now they are closing it.
The law serves what?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses that want to work on the Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday I take my small children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal bio is open four days a week but not the we!
That is access to culture...
It is also the regulation of working time.
the lifestyles he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevik
And if the succession of his daughter was, against her will, used to pay for the costs of succession?
There are paints.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his succession would like his share of the cake, if you do.
His preference for a victory for nationalists / Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its Fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Nor will it.
But for five years, and only for five years, it has been perfect.
In 1940, he led the other arts of the government who wanted to discuss an “agreement ” with the Nazis and was very skilfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that combating fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had over these five years, just over the five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That its descendants sell paints on the free market to collect money from inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, collect money to buy it.
It is as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth, ” Churchill ’ s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only help large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with the infrastructure shipyards by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they clearly reflect the real evil:
Let us return to the princes.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
That the weakest of us is not in need!
Either we support it, either, it has DRILO in exchange for the services it makes or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H, which I prefer to smile corresponds to this vision.
There is also the donor who lives on income from his property.
It is necessary to differentiate the person who invests for a return when he retires and who lives from his rents.
A good thing to praise, or two for a couple, is vice versa.
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of major work, but at a time of great infrastructure deficiency.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are sufferers.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, thus in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of growth is emerging in response to a recession, which is only a brutal savage degrowth, thus brutal degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: the more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, motorways...
But if we want to make the future climate shock worse, then the need for investment is crying: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc.
A tax that favours high incomes and rallies.
Who is in power?
Out of the smartphonies.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
The benefits of Samsung are damaged by the iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range.
The introduction in mid-September of greater screen control for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have attracted buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy Galaxy.
I have tested all of these telephones and decided for LGG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not in favour of Apple.
I think we need an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we had a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google, Apple, and the community open.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
I am inclined to buy Apple because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach value to design, for them the options, functionality and the price.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Let us stop looking for 'a better platform'.
There is' a better car manufacturer ', not really, they are different but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
This is healthier and must be encouraged.
That is in our interest.
I am pleased that you have found exactly what you are seeking and that it is not a Apple product, even though I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhhones.
Our Upper friends who, according to one of them, are fighting ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Dutch bobgos) could tell us what (the author) is, if they fight gender ideas and tell us what works they rightly intend to combat.
Or are they just about the kind described in the Figaro, Minute or Value Areas?
Their sources are Judicth Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you well, and you are an intelligent and cultured person.
I said this on Juith in the Furusto vein about Holpherne, which did not come to me (I do not have his vagacity).
Otherwise, in the 'substance', as you refer to it, this subject is not of interest to me, and I really do not see where the problem is: I had hoped that you and your friends could get out of my backlog because I am slow, but I fully understand...
@ Jean: recognise that, culturally, return Judith to Holpherne is doing so.
Who is afraid?
But what is fear of those who are afraid?
Furasto and @ us give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Bible of the Bible, the second by describing Juith Butler as a very symbolic cat of gorge.
We can see how intimate these studies are at home.
We are, of course, no longer in the debate on the idea.
This is much more profound.
Do you read, Jean, that the Monde has published an article on the need for theology?
@. With regard to a debate of ideas, I thought it was appropriate to go to sources.
It seems to me not to be very rigorous to claim to be able to combat ideas from the mere statement made by their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Gene of Gene or X, theologien).
But it is good, as I explained to our friend, Upper, that is the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not on the other side of the argument.
I did not read Juith, the very symbolic gorge of gorge, I was content with the 'Second sex' (which was more of my time), which I believe is the source of 'source' according to the wishes of Lo.
As I watched the eclipse since Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was briefly shown when the clouds opened up.
This sudden appearance of the red lone had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by clouds.
This was wonderful here in FNQ.
Yes, last night ’ s cloud would truly envy the Cocatoria and NSW coast, while most of the rest of Australia had clear time.
Flash special blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will make it its colour as soon as possible.
Do you not?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also been able to cover himself throughout the week of the Persian meteoric rain and almost all the astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I am beginning to think that there is a bad genius whose sole aim is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even if things are greatly improved on the other side of the Cordilère.
There were periods of 10-20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I am going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
QUIKONEU is looking at this eclipse.
I bet that your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go.
Who or what will you get when it ends (necessarily) by disappeared?
It seems that you have a long time to read the discussions by seeking messages in which people criticise the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
The moon of the moon over the BBridor of Sydney.
It looks as if Mars will collide with the Earth!
There is nothing about stock market and property speculation.
There is nothing about inequality between labor and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon gardens?
The article says too much or too little.
The detail and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyper-text link to the original documents so that an opinion can be held.
Go to see the results of miracles on Tuesday 15 October: in Spain, exports have been at the bottom for five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
However, these are the examples to be followed.
The reform of notaries would generate a request for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economics error?
Will policymakers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack by notaries will have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The next time.
Ok, thank you, JYL...
As far as the management of its budget is concerned, the state ’ s time horizon is not comparable to households, because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite, while that of the household is restricted by the life of its members.
Moreover, unless we consider that public spending is unproductive, these contribute to financing material and intangible investments in the growth of tomorrow and thus in future revenue.
A few points of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the Hippocratic sister: the health of the global pharmaceutical companies ’ profits must be safeguarded above all.
The plot theory of plot.
Unfortunately, the truth is not your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to use it, but they have the hands of the law as written by the policies.
It is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe hohoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the indicted masses.
In fact, doctors do not earn money with medicines.
That is why there are pharmacists.
Doctors do not earn money with medicines as Liberals want our health system to resemble that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are treated in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It was perhaps wrong to put the blame on the people, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and research.
So read the few reports on our spending on Pharmaceutical Benefiits Scheme and the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Comparing global prices of medicines everywhere, as well as differences between one country and another on the free sale or only on prescription.
This is strengthening a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently carrying out tests on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, in spite of the laws that hinder them and the costly permits needed.
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who reach a version offering good quality products to known doses will benefit widely.
As you said, but you are wrong, a lot is happening behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacies.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip on the ear of a person who was in this hospital.
We cannot have DETNIR patents on grass...
If “researchers ” in social science were research instead of politics and networking, they could be used to use their“ work. ”
An investigation researcher does not compare one fact with another.
It is not the intention.
Comparing it is making research not research.
We cannot say ‘ research ’ has to be applied, and then in the same way ‘ we have to experiment with everything ’.
If your research is successful, why can we experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking for them to be applied?
Can I explain how a “researcher ” can infer that a student who cannot equate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other matters more easily?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that pupils learn to use new technologies, but how will they be able to learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
The gun tests are just an indicator, which is an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to move away from the training of Shelts and ideologues and to practitioners teaching practitioners.
This reread the paragraph on the traineeships (which, alas, is not very good) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: ‘ It is a mechanism that primarily leads to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow the system to be moved forward ’.
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not possible for practitioners to teach practitioners, even if they have their place in modern training of teachers teacher teachers.
Education theorists must have no place.
The practitioners must have one.
Would you want to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and which has never set up the foot in an operating bloc before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system.
To give more weight to education theorists is to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is completely crazy: if I do not want to be operated by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, then I would like to have a surgeon with a surgeon that has no theoretical training and has learned on the tack.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative Member responsible for combating the violation of copyright by David Cameron
Why does it not simply say to Cameron to stop?
Someone should have a popular arrest.
Thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright, I will have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright is stolen.
This is the same thing as they must quote their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a licence costs nothing.
No, it is a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing.
By using content without having the right licence, you deprive the artists of their livelihood.
You can always debate pedantic assumptions - but it is flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you like, but that will not be true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Go again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright law.
Clearly, it does not bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should be given money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this shadow income.
Item 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favourite social networks, they abandon all intellectual property at the site under the general conditions they have passed from a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their bullet with a copy in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
If we could export this resource, which we are full of, the rash that says that everything is going badly...
If it is a PS Member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are about to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France is pulling people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What is pulling France down is speeches like yours.
I have always worked in private enterprise.
I had the CHANCE working in companies run by excellent business leaders: that exists in France, but it is rare.
I am paid because I know that I do not have the competence to lead a company and that choice allows me to shoot off the nuts that I frequently encounter.
In my basketles, I fully agree with Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrific truth!
If you compare with German companies that French business leaders are constantly calling for reforms in France, the companies in Germany have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French bosses waiting for?
Let the state keep them?
Is this state which they are accused of?
@ Jacques L.
That is the same breath that you have taken up.
Remember, what have you created as jobs, as added value, to be as severe?
I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an intractable problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are buoking and shaming while waiting for the permanent state assistant!
That is terrible!
But they have solutions: abolishing the Labor Code, employers ’ burdens, taxes, working 45th / week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand lower wages, if not elimination!
I look forward to all the 'negative' comments on this subject.
What is ironic about the way people are always complaining about First Group.
As I see it, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They have tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last is concerned.
But they have also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I did not succeed.
But it is good that Labour is going to get bogged down.
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatised services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the railway contract of the Croat for 8 years.
Well, the Labour Lower, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally in favour of pooling and sharing and believes that workers must all help themselves across borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision.
It is perhaps because Dutch management is on good track when the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of crossing, not the cross.
'He was a battered girl '.
I was in favour, but I really had such an expression.
Assuming that being 'batting' is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence and listening, for example, to being 'batting' has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: 'battered cancers', which are no less dead, I know of them.
It has nothing to do with merit.
Go and start again.
I say to you that it is a condition for administering, I say to you.
Nothing has any merit...
When you look at your life, you can judge them.
I repeat.
It is quite simply monstrous that we should not be able to get away from a disease, if only for a moment.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that cowardly, everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, has a vague idea of what it is.
Nave to think otherwise, if there is no doubt that having a solid morale makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it, to seek experimental treatments like this one, and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is in medicine is primarily someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to get back to the 'lord' is something else.
Neither with deserved credit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to the moralists.
When you catch a salt, a true, you are dwindling to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I have caught two, salvines, big, and if I have been 'beaten' as they say these psychologists have completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is merely to scrap the teeth, to suffer the hell and to burn the blows.
I believed that the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised a decade ago.
I have not seen this name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What is happening?
It is an anniversary.
A forgotten anniversary.
His trial was conducted 'quickly' and then swept away under the carpet.
Is this the story that we were told at the time?
Is the Communist, who have unleashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade, that have unleashed three wars in the Balkans?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what was voluntarily left behind: 1.
How could the NATO bombing be legal under LA MOINDE rule of international law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
On RDRs (Radio-Television Serbia), why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target?
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
If he defended him, he would be swayed by the Western steamroller.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state that subsequently declared independence and was prestly recognized by Western states that later lied to the ground on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not describe Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we do not like).
As far as I am aware, there is only a method of predicting earthquakes in Greece, by measuring the peak levels in the Quartet.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
So a hope, but caution has nothing to do with the HAT-P-11b exposures, located around 124 years of the earth in the Cygus constellation, which would be “the smallest and the cool planet to present detectable water molecules ”, according to a study conducted by the Draka Ding and Jonathan Fraine team of the University of Maryland.
So let us follow it.
Just as those involving animals that pose a threat.
Thank you, Mr Passer, for the fact that we often have the experience of these experimental achievements in the world.
How can animals be (in advance)?
There is no doubt that the perception of other elements of the rate is changing.
Like radon, for example.
A priori gas is an insult to man but perhaps decelable by animals.
All these methods are intractable for humans, but not for the measuring instruments at its disposal.
We do not have a reliable result on these paths …
It has repeatedly been observed (and for centuries) that some animals are acting in a strange way hours with an earthquake, particularly the hens, cows, dogs, but above all fish and swathes.
I had seen a retreat from the struggle of two scientific teams, a Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that focused on the sensitivity of animals to land magnetic fields, and in particular to their change before a sea.
Well, I am not a scientist, but their assumptions had convinced me!
Or is this research?
Why so much contempt for this approach?
We should learn to listen to nature...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we are publishing it in a serious journal, and no one misunderstands.
As soon as we talk about the ‘ signs ’ given by animals, we are faced with the same way: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake was a red fish turned out bizarre in circles.
I do not understand why Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as Mayor of London.
When we listen to the LBC programme we cannot help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he is always trying to distract with a joke.
It never responds directly to anything.
He also said that he was in agreement with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari has asked him what.
He was unable to name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he did not have one.
It only underlines the extent to which the rest of the Conservative Party is only a rabble of merchandise.
Because it is popular.
Because it is funny.
He has been in “Have I ”.
Because it is a celebrity and people have been accused of admitting the celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and the same applies to the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the party ’ s leadership, the Tories ’ popularity ratings will cede the ceiling.
Let God help us.
I am not so sure: people like the jokes, but do they not want their prime minister to be one of them?
That is exactly what the Londoners said.
He should have brought his friend to his friend, the smarter he was.
In many respects, I believe that he is trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans have had one as President.
The French were truly and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there is one, including a French and excellent B.
Millot, the ‘ Solomon ’ and the ‘ strawberle Strait ’ speak, unfortunately, as the dead who have remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cronies, Australia, always have to be in the bottom since the battle in Savoo) do not want to return.
Indeed, we have gone ahead with the il of Savoo in the 'Iron Bottom Round'.
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It is the small.
But the ecolo is a total enmity.
Calculo the kerozene consumes in order to achieve the objective entirely in the concept.
You only have to go through the list of sponsors and philanthropists.
A com operation more or less does not.
The cow is too envy!
I look forward to the estrangement!
Your reticence is reminiscent of me, identifying a little in the passage (I have also learned to sail with Elorn ’ s Crocos to the Mouin Blanc in Brarest!).
It is also true for the ecological message that some people criticise the impact of the investment.
The end justifies the means.
Please continue to get us back, and to show that the Bretons are big travellers!
Pierre, Triniad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red boy that has shown against taxes is happy to know that this journey is sponsored by the UK region and the Ville de Brrest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies in any way should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of a few very nice adventures that are even nice - there!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovan origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in the Juventus and now in the Feerbahçe, are Mitrovica, but I do not know whether they are still in the team still in the team.
It is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevo.
Bajevvic was a landmark or before in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s, with many teams in Greece, but I do not know where he is.
Bajevic is Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he played as an attack on the great team of Velrez who, under the legendary of the legendary Suleman Rebac, ended twice in the Yugoslav League (and also saw points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal equivaless of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you.
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
What has happened in Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in the Juve, he is in Turkey at the moment, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen, he was linked to Blackburn.
I cannot help you here.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener, and as much as I know he is not.
Perhaps he can do something else, perhaps in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Consistically, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbours.
The song is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is known as the Great Albania, but of Albania pre-1913, when the major European powers decided to give the country to neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt 'an explosion of joy' by seeing two rounds collapse in the knowledge that women, men and women who are children are inside?
How?
What I am somewhat annoying in this' testimony 'is that the only fact that, at least once, we have been able to rejoice spontaneously to the horrific death of thousands of people, is a sign of a' limit 'personality, all of which' testimonies' should be taken with great care.
There is no doubt that at the moment of 'joy' we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims have been able to make real and apocalyptic damage to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
A powerful qqich.
This is a great deal.
It seems that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims rounded by their sense of humiliation.
With filmmed testimonies in Palestine.
Classique Schadenfeude.
There was some doubt.
The 'Christian / white / gauus' West cannot measure the degree of cheese, anger and hatred of muster when it conjures up the heifty misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab-Muslim world.
I am talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not of Dubai.
The past slender, which is certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can we get the Muslim world out of this diabolical circle?
Total in phase, 2 poison pools irritate the Arab world: the bigotry of the power in power and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the expression (soft or army) of its critical expression.
Let us have understood that before, we must not put Muslims back.
That is the only way.
Has Edward Plenel read this article?
I assume that this is true in many countries.
In Britain, however, the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months affecting the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone falls ill.
seasonal pressure.
I am suffering myself.
When the light goes, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to be broken in the autumn.
Not as much as the green light of the summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, the summer comes at a weekend.
We have had a good summer this year, do not make your grinding greener.
Not everyone.
I rarely fall ill in winter.
But now I am retiring and I am not going to develop immunity for the springs of the outside world, that may change, I suppose.
It is not about to die, it is just a step in a cycle...
A marvellous phase full of boggling oders, with a feuperity that culminates in festivities like Hallween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of enquiring and full of other wonderful words.
Let us not stop doing things!
Those are my recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the fission of children ’ s increments, it is the amount paid by the state that comes mainly from decimation 8 to 10.
But when it comes to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result, it is the decimal 4 and 5 decisions that are affected (median income) according to graph 2.
The removal of half a share of the widows, above all, is not dealt with at all in the article, or rather its impact is complete under assessment: EUR 230M is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is indolent.
And it is not prepared to get things right.
Well, we are not on the straw, certainly, but on the other hand.
For once the PPS has a rather left-leaning policy, we will not crush...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear far more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let us continue to do so, and you will encourage this 20% less to work or leave.
Well, I know it is not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Long live Troika and OCIs in the SPS: they have understood everything.
You can see what you are looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as it can.
Beyond a certain amount of money, money is losing all its value.
And once the money has been exceeded, the money is no longer used to make money, that is to say, to make the most of it.
We are among the richest 20%.
There is no doubt that the 20% of households that work most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or, if we have social housing, it will be a drop in the arm and a social minimum.
Fortunately, the utopias of the heads of the hat to the red khmer have lived.
I have done two Airbus in Norway recently.
There is no problem.
In one of the two, we have had things that we would not have had in a 50-star hotel, and we did not have to come to the receipt or face any trace.
You only have to go to someone, to sleep there, to go back and go and go back.
Now that will be my first option when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Please take your assurance before you praise your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of ownership insurance.
Will you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6th too late.
I love Airbus.
‘ It is very dangerous and highly risky ’, it is not true.
You just missed the chance.
According to the link in the article:
To its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurd.
In the 24 hours, after an e-mail supplied to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a rorier to change the racks, made provisions to spend a week on the hotel and transferred 23 817 (for which Airbnb is assured, but nonetheless).
Why, then, does this article contain Teman complain that it has received no support from Airbus?
AIRE AIRBB
I am looking for people who have already used bnb just to reassure me.
I am planning to pay an across-the-board rate and a month 's time, but I am rather afraid to send £1 600 to a site which I have never really heard.
But where are we going?
“Supply the troops, ” sang the $Bu of all.
That is why I am not.
I am sure that it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurdish people who died in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to anything other than to the chemical bombing of Sadhar in the cold.
Unless the content of the article was radically amended by the author, your comment is inept (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
The author ’ s style should not be hypermeted: “To seek weapons of mass destruction. ”
We agree.
You believe that it is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to increase education, because we are still at war.
Alternatively, it is TOUJOURS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
There would already be a lot of education, if ‘ the ’ were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
Today, our teachers are gaining more than engineers.
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme.
But that does not happen, because National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college / school with its pros, so they bow home.
A kind of forced telelabour, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the Internet connection, or supplies.
Moreover, it is so much the 17th per week and four months of holiday that we are not able to fill the CAPS of mths, you have come to expect.
How do you not want you to collate poorly educated chives whose parents cling to you in dealing with them?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the knee population can better flourish.
Where the Bush administration has done absolutely everything.
My first graduate job was in the sale in London to earn three times nothing, yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be working for the London metro, that was GBP 5 000 per year, and not even the patent was called for.
I have never regretted.
In this respect, please do not do this if you do not find a graduate job, try to find something or pay for it, or you like to do it.
If I had stayed for graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student student.
I do not like the work in business so much, so I hope in the long term to go through the civil service either in the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL, this article really comes late!
Exactly, when I obtained my diploma in 2011, there was already a three-year backlog.
How best to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the bislight networks as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science is to say what is known as the unemployed.
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished production.
It turned out that the important thing was not a diploma but, as the article says, a good professional journey, starting at school and throughout the university.
Admittedly, the starting wage was lower, but the level is rapidly rising, because in the real world what matters is results more than knowledge.
This debate has been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to rise in the morning, to get to work and to interact with people in order to achieve results.
Politics, philosophy and art are biswelt networks?
That is ridiculous.
I assume that you are talking about the type of study that is carried out by the media or whatever else you have gone to.
Politics, philosophy, political science and art are real networks.
We need people who can explain the big questions to pupils, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and value them.
Would it not be better to have a real territorial policy to disrupt Paris and to boost the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essne and the Val-d ’ Oise doing 80km allergies every day to come to Paris.
Intra-meatos and the small belt already have many different forms of public transport in a different way (metro, buses, trams).
. (FR) A number of safe and closed parks, which are closed, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the veil.
Good.
On the surface, space is cannibalised by the 2RM.
Incidentally, we hope that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much for their great experience in the field.
There was no room for UU SEUL to cling bicycles.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrd Delanoe ….
Well, that is not at all.
When we talk to pedestrians and other public transport users for reasons why they do not peddle it, I think the main reasons are: 1 / c is hyper-hazardous with all these bulldozers, these trucks, those cooters that drive fast and look at the survival of bicycles 2 / one are getting to the bottom of the road, we need to reduce the speed of road congestion, to be able to keep the code of the route written for 100
Hurricane paths are apartheid, we must coexist, but rebalance the occupation of urban areas.
Nothing about bicycles in the big Paris?
Not a word about cycling in public transport?
EFELV is right.
The target of 15% in bicycles is ridiculous.
I am beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo has driven the Greens into the meal.
Indeed, in the course of the debate, the EFTA additions appear to be skeptical.
I am optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find who is really hiding behind this massacre.
It is not Russia.
Not to love the way in which the world is developing.
It is horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been lodged.
In addition, they should submit complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed until the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the resulting criminal investigation.
Outside, however, Libya has not breached Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian Government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been slaughtered before, Ukraine launched an air attack on the rebels, and all aircraft could of course be considered as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people in order for airlines to pay the right to overflight land?
Where all of the pro-Kiev outcry are defending their usurping government / ultra-nationalists in Western Ukraine – and who want to demonstrate in large terms that Putin has shot MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev Government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia will leave this matter to the ICJ.
It is funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have said nothing about this.
To call it Ricardo and to be such a baby, it is appalling!
To call it Polary is a good thing.
There is only one question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I cannot fail to point out that those who are most critical of the Piketty book have not read it!
It is easy to read, I put it a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of restitution, resale capital, unequal concentration, inequality of labour income, capital ownership, deserves and inheritance in the log.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital is in line with the beginning of 20 ° before 1914, shows that it was the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: you do not.
I would like to ask you how long it took you to read this pavé in the knowledge that an individual's capacity for concentration has some limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central theory of the press is right or not.
If it is right, we can debate it without having read the book, the most important of which is to make a one-way street.
No, it is easy to read...
Bernajuzan: how long have you put to read it?
Is the central theory of its pavé summarised by the press wrong?
I have not read and will read it out.
I am therefore relying on the summary of his central thesis, and that is what seems to me to be a future-proof matter.
The notion of gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not generally enriched itself?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive figure and deserves no doubt.
But remember that it is only 17 years old.
An age in which most people are just starting to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden on the young girl and will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colourful perverts are the embodiment of evil.
My best wishes to Malala, but she must realise that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or anywhere else - not even in the workplaces of Britain!
Someone thought that his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving him a great deal of freedom but mentioned that, if she was not where she is now, she would have been married to 14 years.
Is Malala herself not part of these “colourful perverts ”?
You should not have 'time of antenne' on this site.
You yourself are a horrible perverse.
That is absolutely appalling.
No, his father was not going to marry him to 14 years.
She was 15 years old.
His father leads a school where girls are in school and it is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for it to receive higher education and for it to have the right to decide its marriage itself.
But it is someone who is unusual in Pakistan, because he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14 years, without having her say.
It has not been so eloquently stated for you that it has not been so eloquently formulated.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it would say that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married to 14 years.
Rather than this entry into the season 4, and especially by Jessica Lange, which clearly has little difficulty finding his soy character of Marlene Dietriich.
I have just looked at the two very different seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it is one of the best of horror, one of the most successful.
The first fascinating episode.
The achievement is close to perfection, and Jessica Lange ’ s Show sang the anachronistic Life on Mars de Bowia.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be the last to me, without beef beef).
In the case of American Hory Story, I would have preferred to have seen 13 episodes from 3 to 4 months.
One thing, however, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, is the risk of the scenes and of the mountains that have taken place.
In AHS, there is an avalanche of original plans that makes it difficult to make a mockery of today ’ s production.
It is a little escaping me to see you throw the way ahead for the next seasons without even waiting for the quality of the day.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, as you say so well, there is much more besides.
It is quite simply that, for me, Jessica Lange (and, above all, his path and the way in which it is used) is really UU ’ s pillars outside of the technical qualities.
It is a good bag for me.
Then I think it is a matter of writing.
The season 3 was slightly below, in 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I see them as having 10 seasons from American Hory Story or it will end up as 24 hours.
But everyone is doing what they want.
It is by what I say ‘ I will no longer look ’ that everyone is obliged to do that!
I simply agree with my point of view, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, JE believes it will be fatal.
Now, however, that is my opinion.
Let us talk less about tax increases, please - let us go down in government spending.
No, increase spending please.
Those who wanted to sabotage spending failed.
Disparting polemics about relatively small items of expenditure, such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and for all that time some, in every camp, pretend that these nuances are much larger and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The “debt ” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
The “debt ” is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem with the government approaching a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought that it would use it properly.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to cut taxes but, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Spaed 2, subsidies to wind turbines, and nuclear power stations that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Libr-Dem a great laugh.
The first £10 000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35 000 a year will pay about £5 000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay around £10 000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with £200 000 pays about GBP 70 000 (just over a third).
And social contributions?
The greater the social security contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking charges and the car sticker, and it is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is deducted from the source before local taxes and car sticks.
I am paid in a decent but not extravagant way.
This is not a problem, of course, I am happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend that the money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of tax pounds are going.
How can an unemployed person who seeks work at the door prove this?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not seek, that is to say 80% are seeking and are not finding.
Since I am unemployed, I have more interest in what others are seeking or not.
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CV.
Indeed, I have not had any news from Pole Employment for months, does that mean that the agents are more engaged in monitoring operations than really getting employment announcements back?
I do not see interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then we must move from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive issue?
We all have rights and duties, in this case it is ensured that the unemployed do their homework in return for their rights.
Just as a controller calls for their transport title to users of a means of transport, a service leader or employees of their work, etc.
No one is shouting the scandal in these cases.
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had a case at Pole Employment, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the dossiers, cut by 40%, we had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert.
Planning and control are taking precedence at the moment, while the status of a state Pole Employment is, in fact, close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay for them.
Unemployed politicians and French are granting rights that they do not actually have!
That is not normal.
I would add that dignified unemployment insurance is involved in the recovery of wage work.
More than waiting for the murderous twins in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then appear to be the spread of the black plague in 1348 / 9 in connection with the war and population movements at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning Hadj from Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three countries affected.
El Pis reports that 7 400 have seen their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or their recent journeys.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim in Bosnia that contracted the Mecca variant during the Hadj in the 1980 ’ s, probably contaminated by a pilgrimin coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same spirit of mind.
Is it the case that it is very much to propose that the people of Ebola should be prevented from flying for Europe?
I thought it was just common sense, but apparently those 'who know' decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people...
These West African countries in which Ebola is out of control should be kept strictly quarantine.
No one is left out.
Only health workers can enter.
It is 21 days after having treated patients before they can go.
If they take on the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa, although they took 'all necessary precautions'.
This disease can be stopped.
It is spreading mainly by the airlines.
Let us ban them from flying to these countries.
Furthermore, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they can be immediately put into quarantine.
Let us get the message from the first and the group (including religious) second, and he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt whether he is capable of creating a dogma of God's image of the total cortex of the planet.
It is still a long way from this.
It is only 20 years since the information came into being as the given premium of humanity, while religion, which was born of the brain, runs our actions since Lucy.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join.
Those who criticize do not, in any case, stand up to the Church, but only to the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, what is the notion of sin, too much 'anxigen'?
'Orenadise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision for France.
And in the world, this can be done to reach more world...
@ Marine E, to be honest (as usual), respect for others, as you see it, existed in the chair.
Hillel a century before he said: 'do not do others what you do not want you to do, that is the whole Torah and the rest is only a comment: go and study!'
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity, but it is introduced.
Your 'advance justice, peace and fraternity' but without God?
It is a return to communism.
It is a step in the right direction.
Jesus will remain the hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be prepared to play their part in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate to buy that, the new Alink game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game will soon come.
That is not the case.
Personally I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in his campaign to raise funds), but I do not think that this is going to be £30.
If it is the PC version that is of interest to you, Green Man Gaming is currently selling SM at £30 and also proposes a good 20% reduction.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SM at £30 and also proposes a good 20% reduction.
I will look at it.
Of course, it is not at work.
The joy of the computer department is blocking all the sites.
Is it a good day that it is £30 and 20% reduction, or is the GBP 30 a 20% reduction?
But let us be careful: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but cannot play it.
In addition, I bought him on Steam, so no repayment is zero.
It is time to buy a new video card.
It is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam, I believe.
I have not used it myself.
Amazon £30 for PC, £35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they would remove it from your library if they decide to crack down on people who buy it there when they are out of the region.
So look at the Bette version of Elite: Dangero.
For example, was France in 1940 a “purial terrain? ”
Therefore, this Nobel Prize is all very well for me.
We need to love France with 40, that of 'the strange defeat'.
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature, one wonders whether Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel laureate is not even an event; it is not even a matter of reading the authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese, or Australians going to read Modiano, who is already hard to read in French, and who describes such a limited universe and bargain?
I hope that the others are more credible but, frankly, I doubt.
Modiano, Levy, Musso is only a distant report with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
That would be better to judge.
The Chinese, Brazilians and others do not worry for them.
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They
Modiano, if they are not familiar with it already!
On your side, continue to attend Léory and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Mussao all have their chances.
So let us see who won the Nobel Prize for literature: H. H.
Put in 2005, D.
Stop the hungry.
Since I have led one in Iceland, I will stop seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I believe that this trick has followed me up to now.
Perhaps she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrific computer of Superman III?
Mr Danra, always the hatred?
Good day DQ - no, not today, I took my medals.
That is Wednesday!
I have had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the celebration of beer and the cider of Nottingham.
It was a matter of course.
I managed to disguise 19 different beer, Wobby Weaft being one of my favourites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixture of people there, but there were not just some of the few fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Controlling on the return of Sunday was really tough.
On Monday evening we went to the grandfather of a pot to play the nanny.
Thanks to a real chance of beginning, I have been able to go back to several decent points.
I hope that if I come to 95 years I will be as keen as it is.
Last night I went to a chip bar in Farringdon.
One of my beverages has arrived with a fog of teeth.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Bouddha and you will understand how wrong you are, Mr Christian.
Having said that, without wishing to upset you, I believe that you are moving a little further away from the subject.
This is all very well, and it prohibits queues for jihadists from the mosques.
It is immediately indicating the arms trade.
Either we have a great deal of open eyes like Meddeb and Taipa or Boubker, and we have a big eyes.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping our eyes closed that we have the light.
Excuse me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental nonsense: all the authorities, organisations or representative associations, Muslim or otherwise, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these formal official convictions.
Who does not say a word.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arab or African.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kenoch Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, there are doubts about the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and foolish to accuse them of a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong.
In my view, this principle is the negation of the republic and can only help to undermine French society.
There is no doubt, so to speak.
Who does not say a word, but what do we do?
A close proximity to EI or the conviction of EI.
The silence is a practical one, and it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goats and the chickens.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatic.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, during the elections, “take revenge ” from the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has increased between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be cheated with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely fond of Scotland, since they have no basis.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I do not think that even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labor losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who is going to pay a gun for the Labour Party.
They are going to get rid of the SNP and UKIP completely in Scotland, which will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he saved his party but did not realise that he signed the death sentence for his Scottish Members.
Not surprisingly, some Labour MEPs are asking their leader.
If the SNP gains 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralisation.
I think that is the important thing.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Closing the 8% pumps to the detriment of 85% is not an electoral super-strategy.
In addition, once Scottish Members are unable to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think it is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband.
It did so with the Ulster Unionists, and it was successful.
Yet he is still in lieu to be prime minister in 2015, and since he won the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulders and see what he says, how he reads, and to the end.
It is “the life of the others ” of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC …
There is also the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long term, this will at least have a sterilising effect.
I look forward to the next ticket: Amazon produces VOTERE according to VOTE, and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secrecy!
It is like the world.
Forgive it.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of the DRMs is not implanted, it is left to me to read the pirated files, the public domain books or purchased with a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a lot.
Given the price I have paid for the Kobo, it is without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread ownership of their privacy.
You will always see that everyone is giving their loyalty card (fan, of the French public, of the French public).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example, “Finnegans Wake ” from James Joyce.
@ Thomas: In the age of Big Data, the facts do not really need to be personal to be relevant.
We must be careful not to put all the literature into the same breath.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile …
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that are, not allowing readers or authors.
But Kobo has all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government over the last few days that the country seems to be led by a mother class full of schizophrenic rankings.
This is even worse if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan.
It is interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters believe that Islamic is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.
Of course, Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot unless it gains anything.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will come up, then it is actually shooting itself out.
A retirement diplomat writes on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, because that would endanger Israel ’ s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious reprisals or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that, today, the Iranian and US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
Indian Punchline ’ s reading is to be strongly recommend to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the nine-mineage of traditional media, and the short article you provide is important and should be read, bearing in mind earlier realistic and warnings from Iran to Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates ” who seriously fight the horrific secular Assad and, at the same time, the perverts of ISIS?
The pipelines policy is pushing the world into the abyss, and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates ” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
“Is it even worse if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan ” there are other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
What is needed?
Do you realise that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of still being alive?
A little late for that, my pot...
Would the criminals not be barely old now, such as 120 years?
A little late for that, not?
Particularly with regard to the CUP triumvirate, which planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemal, killed just after the 1st World War on revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a breathless place of Central Asia at the same time, when there was a dream of building a Turkish empire.
What a sore!
There is an impressive mastery of the fallacy of the fatal pensioner, but apart from that, we are looking in vain for real contact.
There is no room for argument.
The foeus will always hear a heart that is even fighting in the womb of a bearing mother.
Flesbian couples can simply be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
This is also true.
Children!
What a shame to designate them as future psychological disequilibrium.
One day they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay for this lady (?)
The GPA is no doubt a temporary 'solution' in the development of medicine in our world.
It is not today.
Many women have brought to the world children who were not their husband.
This is still the case, so we are being made...
The important thing here is that this practice should be regulated so that the body 's' commercialisation 'is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are not as commercialised as the bodies.
Anakronik Fareinheit...
It is, of course, more elegant to get a good country off the ground via the Internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder its responsibilities and to avoid scandal in another centuries close to home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs!
This was not done in the name of the church!
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, this man is passionate about something.
In the late 1970s in the Midlands I saw that only by far.
I had to go there because I did not have the right to go there at night!
But if you like it and listen to music - that music today is always so close to you.
I do not know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, perhaps they are put by people who have never been cooled, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the football that awaits your comments.
That is true.
Since the film of Tony Parson, there is a shortage of reports that really reflects the reality of the culture of the north of England.
It is no wonder that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things.
The Northern Northern still lives, but it has been fuelled by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
Having said that, you can look at it if you are in the region of London in November: 99pssoul is going to go back from souls, including full Northern Northern, on Saturday 15 November in Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I, too, thought 'always the same story', but this is a small and well thought-out article.
Your criticism really needs to be more constructive.
Subject.
I admire your documentary.
I suppose you are happy to have escaped Newsnight.
The last train for Wigan in Victoria / Exchange and to take to Wallgate.
By glossing over.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 out of Wigan after buying a ticket after Victoria!
The beginnings of the southern scene are described in an excellent episode of the police force George Genly entitled Genary Northern Soul, who is taking place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@ Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy occupiers (indeed, that was the case of Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred the peace settlement to peace.
He removed his clothes, the post on the rock and entered water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative is going angry and vocifa: 'What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time! '
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiles and added: and now that things are clearly set out clearly.
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not drop the guard...
It is obvious that this is not the intention of the anti-Israelis.
Anticonist: I have replied to you, I am saying: the global geopolitical report...
This has always been the case since politics is globalized...
Evidently, avoided...
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, that is certain.
To create Israel you do not answer.
What power report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Anticonist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force of strength today!
You are in doubt!
Moreover, it is not just about Russell Band, but the Guardian ’ s journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything that he does not have to say.
Much of what he says is nothing more than pseudo-chomskyists written in writing.
This shows that you do not understand what Russell Band says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It is just a continuation of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it well, which means that this is a question of immaturity).
A truly vicious burden, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Band says some truths, perhaps truths which you prefer not to think.
Tell us, this feeling is going to be increasingly widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: sometimes he speaks in a pretentious way, and after all the absurdities of tabloids, he does give the impression that he is a starting populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my view.
The general consensus seems to be that it is right to say to people not to vote and to sit back and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles and videos he has put forward, he says that voting once every five years for Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Days I suppose), and to limit the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, for the two parties, to say that, rather than just voting and
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I believe that being politically active by presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, as politicians are a slap in the face if they really risk losing the elections), but it is to be seen that all these condescending responses that make Jesus say to young people are telling young people not to take the trouble to vote and just to hope that everything will go better.
Its solution is extremely questionable, and it would be good if people were to debate what it actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The rigging of the vote was completely distorted.
I am deeply irritated by the fact that a bulletin has been slipping into a ballot every five years, as my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report back to their voters locally.
In addition, I dispute the idea that the words of Russell Band are not theirs (written by others).
He is clever enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and scholars from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to combine under the "pseudo-chomskyist" label.
I am rather convinced that in a debate it would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Perhaps that is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do as Polly Toynbee and interviewed Russell on a veranda, even with the hallmarks of top heads of the world.
Like Max Keiser, who at the beginning attacked Rousel but eventually became one of his fans and invite him in his programme, it is all too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
It is a political speech that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this “frontloading ” reveals, above all, that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the history of history in which professional historians have become a minority, and the exchanges of specialists have become poorer for the benefit of the kind of Science Po.
I, for my part, had seen the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need for a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop some of the very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats, which are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as guilty.
This is a very archaic thought, the thinking behind it, which is also magical.
The problem of the report is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or libertarian pensioner (both of which mark a tightening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to look for the state ’ s rescue for its markets) in the sense of less state / not state in Foucault.
The old dream of the basis that is self-organizing itself.
Its thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt, it does not stand up.
It says guilty, it says elimination, murder and sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
There is no support.
The totalitarian left remember the good old time, that of his god, Stalin, the small father of the people.
Oulala, you may have read a chunk too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer be amused to attack Michel in this way...
There is a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not, it is an original and respectable thinker.
It is quite laughable to see the cabin orchestrated by scientists in the human sciences of the left who do not bear the brunt of the allegiance to their mantras.
The narcissisme and the authoritarianism of these people are unrestrained.
One important point to add seems to me to be the posturing of these 'rebels', which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other “yellow ” in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You did not have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I do not remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London, and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia, in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think of the white people!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-Blancs.
My father is not happy with his eldest daughter with a Blanc.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and, above all, in recent years: they are becoming increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians are above all prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in professions and in areas where they have a great chance of being exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence.
Although I have lived on the shores of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the views of the Australians on the Chinese and the Aboriginal.
It really is bizarre that a foreigner tells me that I am not shouldering the Chinese, when I met two in my life (including one abroad), did not keep a bad memory, all people are worth and, in fact, those in London were very good that is the only reason I remember they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who is meeting, all people are worth, how to remember who was who was.
You know what is bizarre.
That you and the other Russian are talking about Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always come out with Blanc.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
No, because there is a great deal of chance that the parents of these Blanches will aggressively attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that remains manipulated by groups strongly left on the left such as the magistrate ’ s trade union …
It is a forgiveness, but the legal circles are frankly entitled.
When the magistrate of the magistrate, he represses only 25% of judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the law enforcement in the courts, it commits two obstacles.
Whoever has an observer ’ s political vision like that of the judge ’ s factual interpretation.
Then there is the forced tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The measure of its inobservance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including public prosecutors, forces to distinguish between the error and the bias of the judges.
It would be pointless to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
The claim and the lack of knowledge are not an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics that implicitly show that it is going down well.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
As a proportion of the amount of nuisance power that is given to the judicial institution that is capable of such heresy.
The area that is considered to be the treatment of heirs committed to the method of fraud in the case of non-generalooooogyists being scattered by the notaries of notaries.
This profession is getting EUR 150 million a year, while benefiting from the hedge cover provided by the virtual judicial impunity of French notaries.
For understanding their mechanism, part of it was reported in the following comments.
Where this accords with the so-called moderate statistical improvement in the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between generalogists and heirs that are reluctant to do so, a whole set of legal cases that are contrary to all the laws of the inheritors.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring these kinds of rational criteria not in the form of a form drawn up?
Price prices are certainly totally prohibitive.
There is still material to cover up the disabled.
That can be said, but my brother has one of those trips on the ground, built on the size and weight of it, and it really has allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, wheelchairs and congested tyres.
As we say, the gates and colours...
Tankairi resembles what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankair is the EIPQEU.
I believe that the inventor of the Whill has never had to clean a dog over a chink.
I am sure that my sister would love the triangle on the ground, but that is simply too expensive.
The wheelchair of ultra long distance would be perfect for a handicap with a pensioner for the long run.
Here there are hills.
The prices seem to be high, but there are really people who put such prices in a bicycle, so 'you see'.
The triangle on the ground seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available.
Only if they have become disabled.
The scrap is that the wheelchair's market is a niche, so they can afford to practise high prices for things they know full well.
It cannot really be said that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it is just a draft, and it is not intended to produce it.
I am CONTNT that the wheelchair wheelchair is not coming onto the market, because apparently there is no way to conduct this rigged fig.
Almost 20 000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, in intensive bombing of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people who are under 18.
The children of eight years have lived through Israeli blockade.
The unique situation in the world, which is unacceptable, is also illegal, since the blockade of a 'collective punishment' has all the civilians in Gaza.
'Entrepreneurs who work on their projects are turning a little from their cement to the black market '...
That is not the language of wood, rather concrete and army, the lady...
The references are there to support a argument or a fact.
Anticonist...
Good cement goes in tunnels!
There is the black market that is certain and recognised.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, which is unacceptable to anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The US has a well-guarded field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Do not forget that, after lifting it, Morsi restored the blockade!
I am a Western, so I agree...
Jonathan...
The speaker is Israel / Egyptians...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built towards the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you have thought carefully.
Couchoug is much more cool than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the sharing economy, which is not profitable.
Many are looking for only one evening in Couchoutg.
It is, therefore, to be paid (or at least hope) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if the right addresses are to be sought.
Moreover, owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with species, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What is it renting on? ”
There is no problem with the word, what is the problem with your grammar?
We are not using the word 'to go' in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It is an international newspaper now, if you would not have noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the ship, ensure that it is 100% in line with all the safety rules and ask those who manage and rivers the authorisation to carry out a commercial activity (which they certainly refuse); I have a boat and I have tried to see how to praise it (in all honesty) on Airbnb.
Have you thought that ships can be moved, stolen and painted, sunk, etc.?
The prison is so slow that if someone tried to fly it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijack by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our prisons...
Where are you going to amass it?
No Marine Le Pen is right!
Populalism?
There is no truth other than that which sets out the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
Over 150 000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism will not become poorer!
High finance, speculating, is playing with our businesses, therefore, with our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, our food, with our health care structures, with our debts, therefore, with our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and by our own money.
All of this is for the benefit of a few hyper-obese of fridge.
On the contrary, FH said: 'My enemy does not have a name, my enemy does not have a face, my enemy is finance'.
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed an economic minister as a former Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of the bansters, who are only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else?
You call it how: to return its jacket, to drop its trousers?
Priority and populist action
In fact, we do not know too much what Mariine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see this?
Because the Germans have refused to rescue the survivors.
I am not sure that Spee really has “refused ” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed safe from the true strength of the enemy.
Robert Massia in his book “Castle of Steel ” suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British coffer in the area.
The sea was hard at the beginning of the day; I do not know whether it was still the case at the end of the battle.
Likewise, the fight ended after the sunshine, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare that with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors that are being rescued, you see a calm and full sea.
Moreover, rescuers knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that does not really correspond to what I remember when I was reading this battle, so I made a quick research into Wikipedia:
“A degree of confusion among German ships about the fate of the two cooked cronies, who had disappeared into the black after they stopped the shooting, and a knee-jerk continuation.
Leipzig lives on a fire, but by getting closer to it, it is just a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, is in the late battle and is living in Monmuth, penned and seriously damaged, but still on the move.
Having pointed out its spotlight on the flag of the vessel, the proposal to go to the vessel was refused and it opened the fire, ultimately leaving the vessel.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Goood Hope had to escape and stopped research at 10.15 p.m.
Requests of a British coffer in the vicinity, it has gone to the north. '
So, if that is true, the Germans, let us try in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sunk and therefore could not seek survivors.
They also believed that the Royal Navy had a larger coalgreed in the area that could have seriously damaged it, so in the confusion they disguised to take advantage of their advance.
They were a long way from their base, and they were well aware that they should find a way through many Royal Navy vessels.
Cradok ’ s sacrifice had already caused them harm, and they cut around half of their ammunition, condemning them when they finally took.
There are a number of voices in the UMP calling for it to be enshrined in the law that a permanently condemned elected person is permanently ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected representatives.
But nooon is a joke.
EU ETUR ETTE (ECOPE) UNE INSPRIPTION
When does the trade union ban in sectors already protected?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens?
Agested by politicians, whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to amplify the very people who will benefit from their insightedness in order to obstruct the actions of real policies, which are really trying to make things move, not the fine words whose immobility is commensurate with their complacency.
I met them in the metro at midday with their small banners' for justice, they came from province and did not distinguish between Bercy and POSPB.
It supports the existence of politicised trade unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theories if right-wing, or even extreme right-wing, trade unions were targeted at personalities on its side and led to a judicial and media war.
Your statements are completely free of charge.
If, at the moment, the right is missing the legal news, it is simply that it has committed the facts that come under the law!
There is no such thing as a left-wing person who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have received his attention have not had a favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the union of the magistrate, which is left-wing, is not the only union of magistrates and that it is minority.
Whether a minister supports the trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
The trade union that you refer to is perhaps a minority one among the magistrates, but its influence is great to Chancellor, it is not a secret.
It is now wondered whether the 'mission' of some judges is not more salient rather than being educated.
@ guus - you should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What do you complain about?
@ Pvevene: you forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate everyone.
Is Goody?
And if none of the participants ever came back?
Good day, Karet Wissael.
I believe that even the most stark debtor of glory is aware that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone could accept their offer.
Much has been used as a springboard to start a successful career.
The Directorate Directs fill the stadiums of the world.
Others then sold many disks or are party to West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, which, in fact, is part of the jud.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Cénéne Dion, Cliff Richard, all helped Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and the rest have participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opunity Knocks launched most light entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that is what happens to most stars that do not participate in the competitions.
Few, after a tube, succeed in doing others.
In any case, most songs / groups can best hope for three albums and a bee of.
Outside, but now Cole, or whatever its name, is in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage with a footballer who is breathing in the mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
The end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even if in your dreams you think that all the guys that smoke from grass in the garage of their father and sweep three agreements on a poem of primary school will surely become stars, and the only question is how much they want to reach.
What is worse than ridiculous is that it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that is rapidly coming to racism, because the sacred ethnologists present us with these remote people as infinitely superstitious and petty bigotry, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations on a daily basis.
Unless you interpret the other way around.
Or, rather than saying that the buffer is not sacred, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our MDGs are not too sacred?
Our way of doing this is to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumvent the religious sphere.
That is very interesting.
It is the deeco Eechemere to mourn the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Thank you for that.
The recent Pantheonization of the Republic's figures is an illustration of the fact that the feeling of sacred lives still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw open interpretations of any scientific scientist who lasts the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a criticism of disciplines to be lauded a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations of other disciplines.
This would provide a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures, valuable testimonies to rebuild history, understanding societies, and the example of comparative archaeology are exciting.
This method is not a very old one, and the archaeologists have previously relied on their “instincts ” and their knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays, there is so much technical and scientific means available that the interltation of searches is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
We are here in the middle (and old) polemic of the championship advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clotts (cf of his book “The Punts of History, ” particularly the increased re-edition of scientific controversy, appeared in the editions of the Roche House).
Thank you for this very instructive article.
Maternal men love sex?
For Mike, I could do this.
So that is the end of the day.
I do not really understand why we cannot go on three.
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the caveat?
No, but we are not against a play on this.
We could not look at a musical comedius on the other hand, but it would be too gay!
You could expect that kind of comment from you.
It seems that Mary Whitehead has returned from the dead.
Since your test is almost over, may I suggest that you go to the Cathics Times.
I am sure you will feel more at home.
He prefers mixes.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, and so on at their peril.
Rather than ripe up with these purification jokes.
Not very malignant.
Let us do it then.
If you are so shocked by these 'purification bars', you are not obliged to participate, is it not?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola, and that it is perfectly possible to do both and publish an article on gender.
Is this the subject that is shocking to you, or the fact that people are in the knees?
Nevertheless, there is the amateur video of the crash.
Is it an amateur video of the crash on the net?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests under any circumstances that of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots from the pilots, it would have got out of the bait, because at the moment or another car (for example) entered the circuit.
But soon before the typhoon, we knew that it came, but for which the FOM did not see fit to move the time of departure (television, pub, money …).
But, apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
I also agree with that.
But there is also the fact that if the great FOM comes into the SGP, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English that then led...
You give up on this blog my dear Dayton.
This is not serious, however, and I have a little time to start with all of your 10-30.00.
No, it is not.
There have been many conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of a pilot victory at the expense of another.
It is not the FOM that comes out of the bait because it is the FIF.
It is important.
In the light of amateur images, the absence of an image makes it possible for the IIA to avoid troublesome issues: How is it that the Commissioner has a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the complete video after the accident)?
No, it is not because video is deemed too violent that the FIF is blocking the images of the accident, but because there is clearly one of the Commissioners with a green flag, a sign that the race can normally take place and that you are more under a yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark knowledge of F1.
Yes, Mr Ehold, the race is no longer under a yellow flag, the place of the accident, hence the green flag.
That is the usual procedure.
The post of commisaries just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it may be 10-metre after the accident) is the green light to tell pilots to resume a normal pace.
sensationalism is selling the pub.
Before I thought the media were part of the government's' patriotic 'propaganda offensive, but I am afraid that, ultimately, it is just for money.
And gender, let us not forget gender, the fear of not having a sexual life, the pub and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
Inos do exactly the same.
Creating the buzz with infantry, which we really do not need to care about, is right to continue to fear people so that they can continue to control them.
“When tabloid tabloids about Ebola, we are all appealing for fear, ” it should be“ derailing, ” not “all-out. ”
In view of the medical reference, “touching ” is much better said in this context than“ derailing. ”
I wonder whether all the people who are starving that Ebola might be able to spread by air realise that they now believe in developments.
You are doing too much honour.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of apocalypse that is approaching.
Ebola is Antechrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Set Rule, thank you!
A short and concise article which makes a laughing stock of this despicable pseudo-journalism.
It has done me well.
It depresses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism towards it.
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and frightened (without getting to the hysteria) for the government to get us off the ground when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have a crisis in Ebola without any evidence?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has itself invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be in this world almost 35 years later.
At the beginning, it had to be horrific, given the context of the 1980-90 years.
I am blurred, living with the certainty of going through it for years ….
This is completely unnecessary.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only does the testimonies serve no purpose: in isolation they cannot serve as a scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@ traffic: testimonies cannot be used as a scientific material.
That is perhaps why we are abstaining from putting questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatrist is an explanation that I have been educated telephically by her mother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say that it is the crowd, it is an unimportant testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (and here this testimony, which testifies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments), is no use in a scientific approach?
Where do you base the research?
On fantasy?
Are you putting fanciful theories and facts at the same level (which give rise to verifiable testimonies)?
“Residence ” – the word“ two-mothers ” – J-L Delarue ’ s fans, who take on major psychologists after reading D ’ s.
@ Jim: There is full bozzling in the psyches.
Cyrulnik has brought us the 'resilience'.
As it is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have bribed us a reliable measure to quantify it, that famous resilience.
I wonder whether the air scientists could all save us from Farage and airline?
Do you not think of Team America?
To be sure, it is not a good idea to bring the Single Sky out of the air.
And why?
It was a brilliant series and it would be said that those who are emerging are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the powerful who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to make children cling?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pious, pious humour, which would kill the whole.
It was already a number of children.
Children were clinging.
Ah, because it is a number of children?
UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
Keep your Team America.
Also in Sumpermarriages?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done.
I look forward to seeing this (albeit an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of broadcasting the old.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it is at least 40 years since we have episodes of an hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-class commercial channels and we can always see it at these times.
And, in addition to the episodes of half an hour, we now have to go to 05: 30, from Monday to Friday!
I am probably a 'sad' metre of 60 years, but I am not looking at this whole day!
There is no 'Mount of the temple' in or under the mosque!
The radical Zionists invented this to give political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all Israeli searches below and around the mosque mosque for decades have not been able to find anything.
There is a mob of the temple if it exists elsewhere.
Can it be in Argentina?
It is not being sought for the simple reason that it was the hill on which the mosques were built.
His summit, or a Rocher ’ s dust, is rife in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mohammed has risen to paradise from that rock.
For Jews, it was Ma Moriah, where Araham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
At the moment it was taken and contexalised, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, and it is worth recalling it regularly, and, unfortunately, they are reported to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the government had accepted the plan to 2 states, and has repeatedly raised it!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognise their own?
The shortest Jewish joke: 'God is lauded!'
In order to boast about tourism in Israel, we often have a half-hearted naïve naïve, alanguies on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as we can see from the picture that illustrates the article.
There is a little fear.
This photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a shame that the photographer of Reuters did not look into the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to go to the Mounle Mountain and who would prefer to cling the faithful Jews into a barrel, inviting the Wall to the wall.
@ Mat, if this photograph disturbs you, it is right and proper, it is neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she is transmitting.
This system is not tenable and will end up in the wings.
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution.
Ever since the economy appears to be smiling, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time, and without hiding, they have given ever greater salaries to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in that country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of going back and sleeping when someone else is on the strike, supporting them, showing a bit of solidarity and understanding that their strike is not just about their problems, but also about your employer that we do not take people with impunity.
If we abandon democracy, in which case it is tenable.
I fully agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot be done well.
It is because we are in a democracy that has been held.
Have you voted for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by bypassing national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and states (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people to the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about this in the media: Independent Guardan World Development is therefore looking at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Did Churchill not say 'blood, sweat and tears'?
These are excellent effects, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in XVIII there were trade unions in all the governors.
In the highly Catholic French army, there is a sacrificed dimension.
Leave it (finally, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) would believe that France ’ s eternal values are strong, and it will fight and will close its fury.
Then, with the decline of the country, globalisation, Europe, the crisis of values, in short, the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this small relic, is comforting.
Even if it is increasingly uncomfortable...
They are still lacking the script of married men, calibraries, married women, calibrates, lost dogs, and I do not know what yet yet.
If you do not write the French correctly, I am trade union.
You have been warned, that will be your fault.
In order to defend categorical interests, the protected professions with trade unions are already well enough, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk by an official.
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, there is a disaster.
And with the cartels that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What safety?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance, I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here.
Let us assume that 'through its delegates' in Article 8 of the preamble to the constitution of 1946.
It will become '8.
Every worker is involved in collective determination of working conditions and corporate management.
This is absolutely essential with the arrival of informative power.
Yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on a specific article entitled “The Great British Bake Off Review? ”
Wait, the section was there, every vacuum.
I thought we had to start talking.
In any case, it is the marriage of Joffrey that I have looked at, and I can tell you that some people have been sounded.
In the case of Joffrey ’ s marriage, one of the best (though misleading) moments was in the history of television.
So the late mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
GBBO!
This is the second time that, strangely enough, the programme ends with a victory for the least worst baker; no one has acted as a 'button; that is my cake now.'
Perhaps the additional pressure from friends and relatives outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the past few weeks, all those outside were kept out.
And there is also this idea of 'playing security, there is always next week', which disappears the last week.
I like cooking, but I do not imagine that I will do that.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus give us a super-entertainment and push for new things.
Before GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the marriage cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually make days to do so, and they had to cook one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to share, I do not know how they were able to choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real defect that they were able to find was a little dry (though I agree with Hollywood that the green ice on Richard did not envy, in any case Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to say that several of the challenges of this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time available.
There is also the cancer that drives, with solar wind.
There is no doubt that everything is successful at the moment.
This is a bad time for mankind, hopefully.
You confuse solar and ultraviolet radiation.
The UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is made up precisely by the impact of residual solar and UV particles.
So, even if the magnetic field were to weaken, there would not be enough solar wind to “hunt ” the ozosphere ozone.
There would even be more, and thus less UV and “cancers. ”
Fortunately, the ozone layer is not blocking the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect.
If we limit ourselves to human beings, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), of heating (less than intricacies), of modulating our immune system and, it seems, of improving our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVs and leaves the UVA and most of the UVB.
You know that you are not obliged to be patronising and to regard your interlocutor as a stay when you make a comment.
Especially for a minor precision which was implied in the comment, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Without saying that I am a accustomed to melting, the UV only ACCLER has its development.
They are not PROVOQUNT.
The evidence is that not all bronzees have meltdown.
Either, when a tub tells you that we must avoid the sun and live in a cave, it is better not to listen because the UV is necessary for every human being.
Excessive, however, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melting.
Is it possible?
And, more importantly, can we move on to the mixed?
or switch to the mix...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be planted if there is sufficient force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable.
I believe that the army would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as communication material in the first line.
But for us, the others,
It remains a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be planted if sufficient force is applied there.
A Nokia 3310.
In particular, is it already in force?
This joke is being made in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
It is the fourth joke on the plate that I read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before specific software is installed, one imagines that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain, and it is hard to see how it could come back.
So, mmmmmmmmmmmm............................................
The most likely is that this is a production unit on which the OOS has not been properly installed and is therefore stuck with the plant test code installed.
I do not know how they are doing these things.
But would they put test software on all?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red tape of prototype.
The article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products, and it is amazing that industrialists produce “industrialists, ” but all teachers and small trade are concerned about how good it is, bio ac €1650 (average).
However, in response to your post, if it is possible to eat with a small salary correctly.
After all, it is free to put its priorities where it sees fit.
For my part, food is one.
Some without ransom
It is called bobs, or better boblolos, of people who see the world through ideological “software ” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
That is the total unbundling of thinking.
They are experts, for example, trying to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
He is also experts in stars, joining the gauaaviar, which they sometimes come from, for example, by condemning CO2 emissions while travelling to the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not bear this mixing of red and strenteous ideology as well as being surprised to meet often with criticism about them.
Waterh, thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive theorisation and for all the associated details (plane, sweet …).
I would like to be a member of it, but I am not there.
The concept is not so complicated.
Bobolos are monobloc.
You understood the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you can understand the concept of boboecolo.
It is a perfect copy with just one ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the ecoloads.
Bobocho is one of them, but only the most visible part of the ecoloads, because it is the one that infers the media.
That is a fine game.
Apparently nobody wants to look at this game.
It is so bad that it is just like a female nu.
You are next to the cap.
We must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not spent countless decades studying and pandering to great artists.
The important thing is not that Emile does not know what to do and seems to be obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become a rich and famous country with no artistic capacity.
It is about the fact that the art of the art is over.
No, it is cooking.
The fact that Emile does not know how to map out the carpet
That is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing on the bail.
It may be problematic, but not in that case.
It is much more than just representing the real.
If you look at this, then a photo will do the business.
The author also speaks of Emile's exesperation.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it with the kind of design that you may prefer.
If that is so easy, why do you not?
There is still a need to make savings: equities, the number of public custody horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Unhonesty means that France is reducing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It is only half encouraging...
Operation without support, it quickly finds its limits.
A singular approach, at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
This is a bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@ edmond: that is what I was saying, look elsewhere in the way of making savings but, above all, not in my own, in my own country that really is not possible...
That is exactly what you are proposing to do, to look elsewhere where there is a certain amount of waste.
Whether all those who have come together or proliferate the military situation dare to come here and say here that there is no money wasted on this perimeter, and this without any sore...
Let us apply the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will go a little better.
And for Joi: really: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries, and you will understand why the defence can be a little charged!
Yes, the economies on which everyone agrees that they have to be done must be done, even though it is somewhere, not?
Manique of pot, those on whom it falls victim to murder when it happens to them, the poor.
We should do this but, above all, it does not fall beyond me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Gunulls!
How can we close the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history is repeating itself to every closing post, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is bizarre, a Mayor UMP, who wants compensation and does not look forward to savings in public spending.
This article is really the most staggering sister that I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who make the same bad joke are doing the same.
It is the depressing to challenge his Facebook thread and to see that 80% of his friends began their statutes with the phrase “this embarrassing moment. ”
I believe they will make a film.
It will surely be based on holy scenes, where someone comes into the bus by chance on the bus, going to work, and only realises that his judge has returned to his trousers.
It is not embarrassing, it is completely.
Not really, in my view, the author adopts the role of British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and swap teeth.
I am sure that if you are a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence has been a strong thing.
Do you realise that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have rights?
I do not have the Internet.
I therefore do not think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
My god, I must make this film before dying!
I do not believe that this article is the most unbelievable trick I have ever read!
Charlie has just shown that it is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I would like to turn to the reverse.
It is absolutely essential that I agree with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illuminating and unbelievable gulfs and the insurmountable genius that jumped to Mr Brooker's lifeline as a divine gill.
Well, it really was no.
In particular, if it is not women, nor is it the case.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associations.
So far, we are taking away the right to save our planet from states that play the stars at every meeting to save the planet.
We are therefore deciding to take things in hand.
Together with the Commissioner that they have planted energy, all these fine recommendations have taken place....
Think: Eolian and solar farms are tomorrow's Ronts.
That is all financed by the payable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is far more damaging in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not involved.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions from production and epsilsilon for other steps.
Electricity by wind or PV is already more GHG on other stages and, above all, gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittent.
Replacing nuclear power with wind or PV renewables would run counter to the fight against CO2.
I am not insulting you, I am a physical scientist in physical sciences 1981, I have done research into nuclear physics, I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said.
For what I did not say it was you who gave me ideas, I did not say anything about Germany, but you did not respond to what I was saying and like all the right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
Furthermore, I quote from the experts mandated by the German Government: the current programme of renewable energy is an unprofitable and inefficient way of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction, and if you do not count the lower greenhouse gas vapour of greenhouse gases than Co2 is a reminder of two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant in water vapour and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It does not surprise me, most Indians who make comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, that shows your mindset.
It would have been the same if they had described the giant India of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are taking part, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora's box of corruption and mafia.
With regard to the ISL, today's opening match has been surprisingly interesting, with the Aletico of Koukata imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL and now football, how could we ever compete with our 'noisy neighbours'...
The race for the low cog is paying off.
That is a fine project.
In the case of the incident, the possible lack of design is manifested only with too cold an eelium.
So it is perhaps not a lack of design, but implementation...
Unlike arianspace, which is a private company, it seems that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer.
They are likely to pay the satellites on a fuss that knows.
This is all the more regrettable because many media are retrieved by articles of articles, and many readers are only holding these securities.
In total, this creates a false impression of the content of the article itself.
Quite in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it is unjustly calling into question the project, when it is only a problem of landings.
