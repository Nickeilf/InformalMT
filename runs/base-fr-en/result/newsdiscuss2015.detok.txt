The UKIP's demouries that refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You speak of when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with that in mind, it responds yes when the interviewer asks him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First of all, you use specialist arguments and then discredit them by barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind intolerant hypocrites who think that everything is due.
I believe that it is you who use specialist arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing mills, hardly exists.
I believe that this is what is called democracy.
No one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear a revolutionary.
There is no evidence of a quote from a torch.
Yes, let us take the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, he did just comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be flanked for spreading such populist propaganda as if that were the reality.
I do not think you know what a specious argument is.
You know nothing about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
The Farage sentence was a great surprise, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remark.
You will have to succeed in getting you back.
I am not of course where you want to come, but I imagine you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like.
It is so rare because, unlike Farage and his filtered followers of Thatcher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of God, not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is also rotten in Ireland.
With the new crisis that is going through the austerity period, nothing has changed.
To see almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
In Ireland, the TIOPE, we have been told, a few years ago.
We had the follow-up!
That is what the article says.
We are trying to make the impression that Ireland is a virtuous country, and that a NOUVECE MIRECE is now taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, impotent on Europe's lowest social society, a work of soft work, a continuing emigration.
With these beginnings, it is not the case that we can make a difference at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s of the twentieth century, the ironization was one of the poorest countries of the Europa union, with the Portuguese in view of a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Grey was before.
The fact that their development is not a long, calm river is in the light of the recent scales.
Europe's lowest impots?
That is not true!
Latvia has an impot rate of 0% on companies.
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on the impots paid by the multinationals.
According to a report in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France.
Only SMEs are paying a full price.
Now I confirm that road tracking has become engenial, and there are new cars (and cheer) is all around the street, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been evident in the daily buttons since entry.
Is it supposed to be economic?
Do not worry, I am sure that the comments will soon get bogged down.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhal Astra is involved in a cup on the A140.
Is Ryanair now going to transfer passengers from one flight to another?
I believe that Mr O'Leary will soon be buying a new fleet of appliances, so a few bones and strains on the old will soon be forgotten.
Having said that, I will vote with him next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these people once again.
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that was intended to provide them?
But, without such Irish companies, you could not allow you to go on holiday, a young man.
I have never taken Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer the airline.
No, but it is Ryanair, then they can be very happy.
Any article on Ryanair unleashes tens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair in the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other than the basic tariff have only to take on themselves, etc.
It is quite transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs of this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, if Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of air traffic controllers.
Passengers have been put in another plane in less than an hour, they have no right to compensation.
Dear to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome to the British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS in Syria, not true as you say.
Good journey
Last Sunday in Paris, the streets of the Fran√ßois people: the Marine is largely pipe, and literally groups of world.
People do not come as a mass for the quality of restaurants (most of them, for the most) or for the Salon of the review in the Blangs-Manteu area (hyper-intellectual and slightly dust).
The reason for this crowd is that shops are all open and that the area is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners who spend...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go Paris Rue from Francs Bourgeis, where the shops are open on the Sunday, full of the world with 50% tourists.
Long Fto!
The only argument that seems to me to be admissible is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists, and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy a tax.
The tourist areas are losing a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons.
The industry where expensive equipment, which is used on the Sunday, makes it possible to lower prices.
Dine-rest rest is a right which, apart from exceptions, employees enjoy.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy nor, indeed, the foreign affairs minister, have any competence to reform the Labour Code.
As they move.
The law serves what?
To satisfy a section of the population and businesses that want to work on the Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my small children to the municipal library.
In my Ville of 30,000 inhabitants in France, the Biblical Bible is open 4 days a week but not the wound!
It is access to culture...
And it is also the regulation of working time.
The lifestyle that he defended with tenacity against fascism
The way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevivism
And if the succession of his daughter was, against his will, used to pay for inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are well, some not terrible.
Perhaps his succession would like his part of the cake, if you get the expression.
His preference for a victory of the nationalists / Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And its hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Nor do I.
For five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940, he led the other arts of the government to discuss an agreement with the Nazis and he was very skilful.
Thanks to his wonderful rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and, ultimately, the whole world, may thank you for having had over these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
Whether their descendants sell paints on the free market to raise the money for inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, that they bring money to buy it.
That is just as simple.
But we could use tax money.
Nobody can deny that, when it was' the moment of truth ', Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure building, by definition, not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real miscarriage: distrust of dialogue with dialogue.
Return to the values that are prone.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
The weakest of us are not in need!
Either in solidarity we come to the aid, or it has DRILO in exchange for the services that it makes or made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H, which I prefer to see, corresponds to this vision.
There is also the donor who lives on income from his properties.
There is a need to differentiate the person who invests for a return to retirement and the person who lives.
It is a good thing to praise or even two for a couple.
The small genius of the fund is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of deficiency in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are sucked.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, therefore, in nothing.
Especially at a time when the issue of growth is emerging in response to a recession that is only savage savage and savage growth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, motorways...
But if we want to make the future climate shock less difficult, then the need for investment is glaring: insulation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy.
A tax that favours high incomes and rallies.
Who is in power?
Obseated by the smarphphes.
Charles Arthur is really a galopian.
The benefits of Samsung are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors at the same end.
By the middle of September, Apple control over the iPhone 6 and 6 plus may have attracted buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy.
I tested all these telephones and decided for GG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for Apple.
I think we need an alternative.
When Microsoft put this philosophy in place, we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google, Apple and the opponent community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied with one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them options, functionality and prices.
There is nothing wrong with that.
Let us stop looking for a better platform.
There is' a better car manufacturer ', not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
This is healthier and must be encouraged.
That is in all our interests.
I am pleased that you have found exactly what you are seeking and that it is not a Apple product, even though I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhs.
Our Uphalist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Paris's bobs) could tell us what (the author) if they fight ideas on gender and tell us what works they want to combat.
Or are they just attacking the kind described in Figaro, Minute or Valtors Acaes?
Their sources are Judth Butler or Eric Zemour?
Well, John, I like you well, and you are an intelligent and cultivated.
I said that on Judiouth in the Fuusato vein, which spoke about Holoperne, a rapprochement that did not come to me (I do not have his viviity).
Otherwise, in the 'substance', since you refer to it, I am not interested in this subject, and I really do not see what the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get out of my arrears, because I am slow but I understand...
@ Jean: recognise that, culturally, we send back to Holopherne, that is the case.
Who is afraid of the Monde?
But what is the fear of those who are afraid?
Furasto and @ us give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judicial of the Bible, the second by describing Judicth Butler as a very symbolic toy.
We see how intimate these studies are at home.
We are, of course, no longer in the debate.
That is much deeper.
Did you read, John, that the Monde published an article on the need for theology?
When it comes to a debate on the idea, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To seek to combat ideas from the only statement that their critics are making (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theoria of Genre or X Lacpassing, theologians) does not seem very rigorous.
But it is good, as I explained to our Pumpelian friend, that the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not, moreover, aware of the nuance.
I have not read Judith, the very symbolic brass of gorge, I have just got the 'Second sex' (that was more than my time), which I believe is the source of 'source' in the wishes of Lo.
As I watched the eclipse since Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was briefly shown when the clouds were open.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for disappointment at sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was wonderful here in FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really bury the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of Australia had a clear time.
Special bloodshed.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hckey make the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true colour as soon as possible.
Do you not?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover the whole week of the meteid rain rain and virtually all of the important phenomena of recent years.
I begin to think that there is a bad genius whose sole aim is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Corelila.
There were periods of 10-20 minutes when I could not see eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I will put a TAXE on this eclipse.
QUICOQEU is looking at this eclipse.
I bet that your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you sink.
Who or what will you get when it ends (necessarily)?
It seems that you are taking a long time to read the discussions by seeking messages in which people criticise the Abbott Government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Sugar photograph of the moon over the Battle Bridge of Sydney.
It seems that Mars is going to collude with the earth!
There is nothing about stock market speculation and buildings.
There is nothing about inequalities between income and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypera link to documents of origin so that an opinion can be made.
To see today, Tuesday, 15 October, the results of miracles: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest for five years.
In Greece, the stock market collapses.
Yet it was there that there were examples.
The reform of notaries would generate a request for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims are not justified.
What about the Ministry of Economics?
Will the decision makers have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack by the notaries will have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The next step is.
Oh, thank you, JYL...
It is not the case that the state is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget, because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinitely infinite, while that of the household is restricted by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is unproductive, they contribute to financing material and intangible investment in tomorrow's growth and thus future revenue.
A few points of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred snap of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Jolie theory.
Unfortunately, the truth is not your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands of the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions, rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe hot rooms for drug addicts, rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to be happy with the masses.
In fact, doctors do not earn money with medicines.
That is why there are pharmacists.
Doctors do not earn money with medicines, as Liberals want our health system to resemble that of the United States, you should tell you how it works.
Doctors throughout the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
Perhaps it was wrong to put the blame on the Blocks, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and research.
So let us read the few reports on our expenditure on Pharmaceutical Beneme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Comparing world prices for medicines everywhere, as well as the differences between countries on what is free or only on prescription.
This is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently carrying out tests on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that are hindering them and the onerous permits required.
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products to known doses will benefit greatly.
You can tell you that, but you are wrong, there is a lot in the backroom for doctors and pharmacists.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone cares the chip on a hospital head.
ETUNITIR should not be allowed on grass.
If 'researchers' in social science were to make research instead of making politics and networking, we could use their 'work'.
A researcher investigation does not compare one thing with another.
Comparing that is not the case.
Comparing it is making the teaching of research not.
It cannot be said that research is successful, and then in the same jet 'we must experiment with everything'.
If your research is successful why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking you to apply them?
Can I explain how a 'researcher' can deduce that a pupil who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could make mathematics and other matters easier?
The new technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that pupils learn to use new technologies, but how will they manage to learn new technologies if they cannot learn?
The test tests are only an indicator that will allow us to find indicators that are satisfactory.
What is the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to move away from the training of the proxies and ideologues and teach practitioners.
Let us make the paragraph on trainees (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: 'it is a mechanism that leads to the reproduction of the practices in force, and does not allow the system to move forward.
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have their rightful place in modern teacher training teachers.
Education theorists must have no place.
The practitioners must have one.
Do you wish to be carried out by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and which has never been set up in an opera bloc?
There is no consensus on the causes of the education system.
Giving more weight to educational theorists would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is entirely crazy: if I do not want to be made by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like to make even less use of a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learnt about it.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MEP for the fight against the violation of copyright by David Cameron
Why does it not simply say in Cameron that we should stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, I will have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright is being violated.
That is the same thing as they must name their sources properly.
Often, obtaining a licence costs nothing.
No, it is a violation of copyright.
Not at all.
By using the content without having the right licence, you are depriving artists of their livelihoods.
You can always discuss educational assumptions - but it is flight.
You can repeat it as much as you will, but that will not be the case.
It is a violation of copyright.
Please repeat it.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright law.
It does not help you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am pleased to deprive them of this fictitious income.
lesson no 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favourite social networks, they abandon intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed from a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their m3 bull with a copy in school buses, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
If we could export this resource to which we are full, the rass that says that everything goes wrong...
If it is a PS Member who says so, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are in the age of choice I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France is pulling people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What is taking France to the bottom is speeches like yours.
I have always been a private company.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to lead a company and that choice allows me to shoot down on the spoils that I frequently encounter.
In my baskeys, I fully agree with Jean-Pierre Bernajizan: he says the horrible truth!
If you compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric in order to make it competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French boss waiting for?
What does the state hold to them?
Is this state that they are guilty of?
@ Jacques L.
Still on your side!
Remember, what are you created as jobs, as added value, to be so severe?
I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of the French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are moving and undermining while awaiting the permanent state of the state!
That is terrible!
But they have solutions: abolishing the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45th / week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to call for a reduction in wages, not to be abolished!
I look forward to seeing all the 'negative' comments on this subject.
What is ironic is the way people are still complaining about First Group.
As I see it, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They have tried to keep afloat rather than turn.
It does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Lawt.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to do so recently, but I did not succeed.
However, the Lower will get us out of trouble.
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to stop people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatised services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there is better: MTR, a company in Hong Kong won the SCM for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they have told us during the referendum campaign, is completely in favour of pooling and sharing and believes that the workers must all help themselves across borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision.
Perhaps it is because Dutch management is on good track when that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not simply a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of crossing, not the cross.
'He was a fighter '.
I was in favour of it, but I was very happy with it.
To assume that being 'beaten' is a better quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact that being 'beaten' has nothing to do with that of surviving a disease: 'battery' cancer, which is no less dead.
Spending a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let us also start again.
I say to you that it is LA condition for the management, I tell you that it is FDI.
Nothing has any merit...
When you look at your life, you can judge them.
I repeat.
It is quite simply monstrous that we should not be able to get the credit out of a disease or that it can be undone not to get out of it.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that is cowardly, in spite of the will, despite confidence in medicine, has a vague idea of what C is?
Ned to think otherwise, if a solid morale is likely to make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not to reject them by fear.
Someone who is beaten in medicine is above all someone who trusts medicine.
But if you prefer to get back to the 'lord' that is something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are a matter for moralists.
When you catch a salvage, a real, you have got to the point of becoming a zombie.
I personally caught two, salt, big, and if I have 'beaten' as these psychologists say, it has completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is only to bend teeth, to suffer the hell and to bury the blows.
I believed that the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised ten years ago.
I have not seen this name in the newspapers at least.
What is happening?
It is an anniversary.
A forgotten anniversary.
His trial was conducted 'quickly' and then swept under the carpet.
Is it the story that was said at the time?
The communist communist that triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what has been deliberately left aside: 1.
How could the bombing of NATO be legal under MA MOINDRE rule of international law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
With regard to RTS (Radio Televisited Serbia), why do you not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target?
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swayed by the Western steamroller.
The West used a smokescreen to depart part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally declared its independence and was virtually recognised by the Western states who then lied to the end of the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not describe Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we do not like it).
As far as I am aware, there is only one method of prediction of earthquakes in Greece, measuring the pitiful level in the Quartet.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
So there is a hope, but caution has nothing to do with the exoplicet named HAT-P-11b, located around 124 years of the earth in the Cygnus constellation that would be 'the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable molecules', according to a study conducted by the Drake Ding and Jonathan Fraine University of the University of Maryland.
So we are going to follow.
Like those that involve animals, there is a threat.
Thank you for the science of regaining us, often, of these experimental achievements in the world.
How will animals be saved (in advance)?
There is no doubt that there are other elements that are changing in the event of earthquake.
For example.
A priori that is inodore for man but perhaps can be found by animals.
All these methods are indefensible for man, but not for the measuring instruments.
However, we do not have a reliable outcome on these paths...
It has been repeatedly observed (and for centuries) that some animals act in a strange way a few hours with an earthquake, especially the hens, cows, dogs but, above all, fish and smiles.
I had seen a reportering of two scientific teams, a calidrine, the other Japanese, in order to recognise the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the land magnetic fields, and, in particular, to their modification before a seatism.
Well, I am not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or is this research?
Why is so much contempt for this?
We should learn to hear the nature...
If you look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one is mistaken.
As soon as we talk about the 'signs' given by animals, there is one thing in the same way: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the red fish were stranded in circles.
I do not understand why we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as a mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC programme we cannot stop thinking that this man knows nothing and that he is always trying to diverge with a joke.
It is never directly answered.
He also said he was in agreement with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari has asked him what.
He could not name a single point.
He made so many promises to get elected as a mayor and he did not hold one.
It only serves to underline the fact that the rest of the Conservative Party is only a mass of merchandise.
Because it is popular.
Because it is funny.
He was in 'Have I News'.
Because it is a celebrity and people have been charged with the adulteration of celebrities.
The Lononians voted for it, and the same applies to the rest of the country.
When - and not if - he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity ratings of the Tories will go down the ceiling.
Let us God help.
I am not so sure: people love the jokes, but do not want their prime minister to be one of them.
That is exactly what Londonians said.
He should have brought his friend the parpains, smarter than he was, to him.
In many respects, I think it is trying to copy R Branson R Branson
The Americans have had one as President.
The French have truly and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are, including a French and excellent B.
Milk, the 'Solomon' and the 'strawberry strait' speak, unfortunately, as the dead who have stayed there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy crusaders, the Australia, must always be in the bottom since the battle of Savoo) do not want to go back.
In fact, we have gone to the il of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Round.
Even if the mission has ended.
It is small.
But the ecology is a total encroachment.
Calcult the kerozene consumes to achieve the objective of fully discovering the concept.
Just look at the list of sponsors as philanthropy.
A com operation is more or less done.
The cow is too envy!
I look forward!
Your reticence replaces me, by identifying a little in the passage - I have also learned to sail with the Battle of the Elorn to the Mouin Blanc de Brest!
Also for the ecology message, meme if some criticise the impact of investment.
The end justifies the means.
Continued to get back, and to show that the Bretons are big travellers!
Pierre, Triniad and Tobago.
Good evening I think that the red tape that has been shown against taxes is happy to know that this journey is sponsored by the British region and the Ville de Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies in any way should not devote a penny of our taxes to finance the dreams of a few adventurous adventures - that is the case!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training of Kosovo?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in the Juventus and now in the Facerb√ße, are Mitrovica, but I do not know if they are still in the team in the team.
It is Bishevac the advocate of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was middle ground or before the 1970s and 1980s, and led to many teams in Greece, but I do not know where it is.
Bajevic is Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attack in the great team of Velez who, under the legendary of the legendary Suleman Rebc, ended twice in the Yugoslav league (and also had points such as Vahid Halilhozic and the faithful crews of Arsene Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you.
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primoric.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen was linked to Blackburn.
I cannot help you here.
I know he lost his place when he arrived, then he went to the Foler and as far as I know he was not.
Perhaps something can still be done, perhaps in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Simply, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbours.
The point is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is known as the Grand Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the major European powers decided to hand over the country to neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt 'an explosion of joy' by seeing two rounds collapsing in the knowledge that women, men and people who have no doubt children are inside?
How?
What bothers me a little in this' testimony 'is that the only fact of having been able, if only once, to rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, is testimony to a figure that is' subder ', of which all' testimonies' should be taken with great care.
There is no doubt that in the short term of 'joy' we will not have thought about the deaths or the reality of the horror inflicted.
It was just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to make a real and apocalyptic contribution to the big Satan in its very heart.
A strong Qqlich.
It is important.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims with their sense of humiliation.
With film reports in Palestine.
Classique Schadenbrod.
There was a little doubt.
The 'Christian / white / legal' West cannot measure the degree of cheating, anger and hatred of mumman when it contests the heights of poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Muslim Arabic world of today.
I am talking about the mistakes of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past slender, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can we get the Muslim world out of this evil agreement?
Totally in stage, two major poisons are irritating the Arab world: the bigotry conservatism of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and excommunication (soft or army) of its critical expression.
It should be understood that it should not take Muslims back.
That is the only way.
Did you read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, the autumn marks the beginning of six long, humble and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone is falling ill.
seasonal pressure.
I am suffering from that myself.
When the light goes, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and welfare.
The autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to break the breath in the autumn.
Not so much to bend the breath as the green light when everything is living instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, the summer comes at a weekend.
We have had a good summer this year, do not do your grinding that is giving the clich√©s!
Not everyone.
I am rarely ill in winter.
But now I am retiring and I am not developing any immunity to the germs of the outside, that can change, I suppose.
It is not about to die, it is just a step in a cycle...
A marvellous step full of encroaching osts, with a feat that culminates with festivals like Hallween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of encroaching and full of other wonderful words.
You need not stop doing things!
These are my recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
In the case of the taxation of children's increments, it is the amount of money that the state is receiving, mainly from the decisions of 8 to 10.
However, with regard to the number of households who have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure, it is mainly the 4 and 5 declines that are affected (median income) according to 2.
The deletion of half a year on widows is not dealt with at all in the article or, rather, its impact is supplemented by an assessment: EUR 230M is a joke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is indolent.
And it is not prepared to get off the ground.
Well, we are not on the doorstep, but let us think about it.
For once the SPS has a rather left-wing policy, we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let us continue to do so and you will encourage the 20% less work or leave.
Well, I know that it is not politically correct, but I say it nonetheless.
Towards the recycled Trots and OCOI to the PS: they have understood everything.
You can see what you are looking at.
The proportion is always the same, both here and in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from amassing as much as he can.
Beyond a certain amount of money, the money is losing all its usefulness.
Once the money has been exceeded, money is no longer used only to make money, that is to say, to make the most of the misery.
One of the richest 20%.
There is also no doubt that the 20% of households that work most (and create wealth which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or, then, let us reduce the arms and live social minimum, especially if we have social housing.
Fortunately, the utopia of the heads of heads in the red knail have lived.
I did two AirBB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we have had things that we would not have had in a hotels 5 stars and we have not had to come to the receiving end or face any trace.
It is enough to go to someone, to sleep, to side behind and to leave.
From now on this will be my first option when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Take your assurance before you praise your house.
In most cases, you will need a kind of insurance insurance.
Are you going to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6th too late.
I love Airbus.
'This is very dangerous and highly risky '.
You have just missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
In its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurd.
In 24 hours, according to an e-mail supplied to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a rurring to change the racks, made provisions to spend a week on hotel and transferred $23 817 (for which Airbnb was assured, but still).
So why is this Article Teman complaining that he has received no support from Airbus?
I have to say that I should like to travel as to travel as to travel to travel as to travel.
I am looking for people who have already used bnb just to reassure me.
I am planning to pay an acid and a month to rent, but I am rather afraid to send GBP 1 600 to a site that I have never heard about.
But where is it going?
'Supporting troops', singing the Bu on all of us...
So harmless.
I am sure that it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in halabja to learn that their parents and friends succumbed to anything other than the chemical bombardment of saddressing.
Unless the content of the article has been radically amended by the author, your comment is inundated (to remain polite).
Moreover, what is the mass crime committed in 1988 to prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not a matter of hyper-style style: 'to seek weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You believe that it is the time to weaken the army in order to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternatively: is it a time for strengthening education, because we are still at war?
A great deal of education would already be strengthened if we were 'the' to work 35 hours instead of 17.
Today, our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And we do not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing for their programme.
But that is not the case, because the National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the College / lygraduate to its pros.
A sort of forced teleworking, except that the employer pays neither the computer nor the Internet connection, nor the supplies.
Moreover, it is so much the plate at 17.00 a week and 4 months of holidays that we are not going to meet the MPBs of maths, you are expected.
How do you not want to collude you with poorly educated chippers whose parents hold you over by treating you as a matter?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm jihadis so that the kuru population can develop better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything.
My first job graduated was in the sale, in London, to earn three times, and yet it was a job for which a qualification was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be open for the London underground, it was paid GBP 5 000 more per year, and not even the patent was asked.
I have never regretted.
In this regard, you do not do so if you do not find a graduated job, try to find something that is going well, or you like.
If I had remained in the job, I would still have to pay my student loan student.
I do not like the work in business so I hope to be in the public service in the long term or in the academic world.
LLL LOL L.
Exactly, when I obtained my qualification in 2011, there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of graduates unemployed?
To get rid of the biscut networks like art / letters / theater / media / political science / science is to say what is known as the unemployed.
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished production.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree of qualification but, as the above article says, a good professional journey, starting at school and throughout the university.
Admittedly, the original wage was lower, but we are rapidly increasing the levels because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This study of artistic engineering / work has been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to rise the morning, to get to work at the moment and to interact with people in order to achieve results.
Little, philosophy and art are bisks?
That is ridiculous.
I assume that you are talking about the kind of study of the media, or whatever the absentee sector, where you have gone.
Little, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people to be able to explain the major issues at school, which understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art and so on, and put them in value.
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to disintegrate Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I find it difficult to see the people of the bottom of the Essonne and the Val-de Oise making 80km allerrels every day in bicycle to work in Paris.
Intra-mouths and small belts already have many means of transport in common in a different way (metro, bus, trams).
A number of secure and closed parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed in the veil.
Good.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris works with professionals in the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much experience in this area.
Well, there has been no room for UN SEUL as a mechanism for ciling bicycles.
The motivation seems to be stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrd Delanoin...
Well, that is not at all.
When we talk about pedestrians and other public transport users of the reasons why they do not peddle it, I think the main reasons are: 1 / c is hyper-dangerous with all these animals, these trucks, these fast-moving scooters, and the survival of bicycles 2 / you are running out of pollution at the top of the road, and we have to reduce the road traffic system.
The bicycle paths are apartheid, we have to live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing about the bicycle in the great Paris?
Not a word on the place of bicycles in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% in velo is ridiculous.
I start to believe that Anne Hidalgo has routined the Greens in the meal.
In addition, the EELV accords seem to be sceptical.
I am optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find who is really behind this massacre.
This is not Russia.
Not sure how the world is developing.
It is horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been lodged.
In addition, they should be lodged first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed until the outcome of the report of inquiry into the accident and the criminal investigation that would ensue.
It was not, but Libya did not blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for air space security, in this case the Ukrainian Government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been slaughtered earlier, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels and any aeroplane could of course be regarded as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people in order for the airlines to pay the right to overflying the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their usursteal government and the ultra-nationalists in Western Ukraine - and who want to show that Putin has shot the MH17 flight?
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev Government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment by the International Court of Justice, which concluded that the use of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will leave this case to the ICJ.
It is funny to think that Abbott wants to tell Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
Until now, the investigators have not said anything like that.
To call Ricardo and to be such a benevolence, it is distressing!
To call Polaire is to lose the north.
There is just one question: is the poor today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can only say that those who criticise the most virulent of the Piketty Book have not read it!
It is easy to read, I have made a few days.
It shows the statistical development of rescu-production, resale capital, unequal concentration, inequality of labour income, capital ownership, deserves and inheritance in the log.
It shows that today's concentration of capital is in line with that of the beginning of the 20 ¬∞ before 1914, it shows that it was the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then the concentration takes place after...
Bernajzan: you are not doing what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paved, knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has some limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis of the press is right or not.
If it is right, we can debate it without having read the book, which is the key to a one-way street argument.
No, it is easy to read...
Bernajzan: how much time have you made to read it?
Is it the case that the central thesis of the press is wrong?
I have not read and will not read it.
I am therefore relying on the summary of his central thesis, and that is what I think is pure nonsense.
The concept of gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has mankind not generally enriched itself?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousazai is an impressive figure and deserves the price undoubtedly.
But remember that it only has 17 years.
An age to which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the young girl and will find its way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old adage that the perverse colourings are the embodiment of evil.
All my happiness in Malala, but it must realise that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular areas of Britain!
Someone thought that his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a great deal of freedom but she mentioned that, if she were not there now, she would have been married to 14 years.
Is Malala itself not part of these 'perverse colours'?
You should not have any 'anchoring time' on this site.
You, yourself, are a horrible perverse.
This is absolutely appalling.
No, his father was not going to marry it at 14 years.
It was 15 years old when it was fired.
His father leads a school where girls are in school and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, to receive higher education and have the right to decide on its own marriage.
However, it is someone unusual in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14 years, without having a say.
Dear that she did not say so eloquently for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it would say that, if his father had not given him freedom, she would have been married to 14 years.
Instead of the entry into season 4, and especially by Jessica Lange, who obviously has a little difficulty in finding his soap character in Marlene Dietriich.
I have just looked at the two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it is one of the best horror stories, one of the most successful.
A first fascinating episode.
The achievement is close to perfection and Jessica Lange song singing the anachronistic Life on Boys is simply overturning.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be the last for me, without a beef beef).
In the case of American Horror Story, I would prefer to have a look at 13 episodes of 3-4 months.
One thing, however, is that, apart from Jessica Lange, it is, above all, the risks of the scenes and of the mountains that took me.
There has been an avalanche of original plans in AHS which makes a mockery of the aegtisation of today's productions.
It is a little bit out of a little bit of you to look ahead in advance for the next seasons without even waiting for quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, as you say, there are many other things.
No, it is simply that, for me, Jessica Lange (and above all her path and the way she uses it) is really UN pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
I look very much at it.
Then I think that the number of words in writing is too much.
The season 3 was slightly below, in 2 that was too fragmented despite some excellent episodes.
I see them not doing 10 seasons from American Horror Story or will end up like 24 hours.
But everyone is doing what they want!
It is by what I say 'I will not look at any later' that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my view, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, JE thinks it will be fatal.
However, that is my opinion.
Let us talk less about tax increases, please - let us go instead in government spending.
No, let us increase spending.
Those who wanted to sabotage spending failed.
Achieving polemics about relatively small items of expenditure, such as development aid.
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of direction that the voters seem to be calling for and during all that time some people in each camp pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters are clear in their game and find bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The 'debt' is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
The 'debt' is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem with the government coming up to a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it properly.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Sapeed 2, the subsidies to wind turbines and nuclear power stations that cost twice as much as they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Lind-Dem quite ridiculous.
Your first GBP 10 000 is not taxable.
This means that someone earning GBP 35 000 a year will pay around GBP 5 000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with GBP 50 000 worth around GBP 10 000 (one fifth), and someone with GBP 200 000 is paying around GBP 70 000 (just over a third).
And social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the higher parking costs and the car sticker, and it is before VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I am paid in a decent way, but not in an extravagant way.
No, of course, I am happy to pay my taxes.
But let us not pretend that the money is coming from the sky, or that it is not important to know where billions of pounds are going.
How can an unemployed person who seeks work?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not seek, that means that 80% are seeking and are not.
As someone who is unemployed, I have more interest in the others seeking or not?
That a potential recruitor receives 10 or 20 CV.
Indeed, I have not had any news from Pole Employment for months, that is to say that agents are more busy with controls than really getting back from job announcements?
I do not see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then we must move from Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive issue?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we are ensuring that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a supervisor asks for their transport title to users of a mode of transport, a head of service or the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody is shouting the scandal in these cases.
It is indeed worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had a case at Pole Employment, my rights in the European Radical Alliance had been poorly established, and on one of the dossiers, which was cut by 40%, it took a firm battle.
It takes time!
I am not an expert.
Fighting and monitoring is taking place at the moment, while the ruling Ple Employment is close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, it is they who are paying the hitches.
Non-wage policies and policies are granted rights that they do not actually have!
That is not normal.
I would add that dignified unemployment insurance is involved in the recovery of labour work.
More than waiting for murderers in Arabic...
In fact, we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria, which will stop Isis, so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then look like the spread of the black plague in 1348 / 9 in connection with the war and movement of people at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning Hadj in Mecca this year to the Muslim pilgrims from the three countries affected.
El Pese reports that 7 400 have seen their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or their recent journeys.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the Mecca variant during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same mind.
Is it not a matter of heart to propose that the sufferers of Ebola be prevented from taking an aeroplane for Europe?
I thought it was simply common sense but apparently those 'who know' decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries in which Ebola is out of control should be put into quarantine.
No one is going.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can go.
If they enter the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are guerrillas.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were infected after having had contact with people in West Africa despite having taken 'all the necessary precautions'.
This disease can be stopped.
It is spreading mainly from the airlines.
Let us stop them from flying to these countries.
Furthermore, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they can be put into quarantine immediately.
Let us get the message from the first person and the group (including religious) second, and he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he will be able to erect the image of God with the total cortex of the world in operation.
It is still a long way from that.
It is only 20 years since the information became known as the bonus of humanity, whereas religion, which is derived from the circle, is running our actions since Lucane.
What is the point of becoming yet another Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join.
Those who criticise would not put their feet on the Church anyway, but only the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the concept of sin, too much 'anxiety'?
Lorry the church is not limited to France.
And in the world, it can be that way to get more world...
@ Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you see it predicted to be at risk.
Hillel a century before he said: 'do not do others what you do not want to be done, that is the whole Torah and the rest is just a comment: it is going and studying!'
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity, but introduces the agapt.
Your 'advancing justice, peace, fraternity' but without any god?
It is a return to communism:
The first step is to remove the embodiment and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has changed moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be prepared to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and bring about justice, peace and fraternity.
Not a Catholic?
I believe that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate to buy that, the new Alink, or Wasteland 2 game.
And the new Elicte game is soon to come.
That is not the case.
Personally I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even took part in his campaign to raise funds), but I do not think it is worth GBP 30.
If it is the PC version that is of interest to you, Green Man Gaming is now selling SM to GBP 30 and is also proposing a 20% reduction.
Green Man Gaming is now selling SM to GBP 30 and is also proposing a good 20% reduction.
I am going to look.
Obviously not at work.
The rails of the computer department are blocking all sites.
Good morning, is it GBP 30 and then 20% reduction, or does the ¬£30 include the 20% reduction?
Let us be careful, however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me surprise, I bought it, but I cannot do it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no repayment is zero.
It is time to buy a new video card, which makes the cut-off of it.
It is a Brazilian site, but you have a valid Steam identifying, I believe.
This is an accessory and all that: I did not use it myself.
Amazon GBP 30 for PC, GBP 35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 ¬£44 for Xbolx and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they will remove it from your library if they decide to take action against the people who buy it when they are outside the planned region.
Really the beeta of Elite: Dangerus.
For example, was France in 1940 a 'puriad breeding ground'?
So, then, this Nobel Prize was a poisoned present.
France must be helped by 40: 'strange defeat'?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for Literature, you are wondering whether Proust or Dosstoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel laureate is not even an event, but one does not even want to read the original authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, who is already difficult to read in French, and who describes a universe that is so limited and so egregious?
I hope that the others are more credible, but frankly I doubt.
Modiano, Levy, Mouso only has a distant report with literature.
Have you read at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
That would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, do not worry for them.
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate that.
If they do not know the value of Modiano, if they do not know.
For your part, you continue to attend Levy and Muso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaum Musso retain their chances.
So let us see who obtained the Nobel Prize for literature.
Put in 2005.
Stop them.
Since I have led one in Iceland, I will stop seeing Kia Spork everywhere.
I believe that this has been followed up so far.
Perhaps she wants to crush me?
Or can I go along with the dreadful computer in Superman III?
Good day Dantra, always hatred?
Good day QQ - not, not today, I have taken my medicines.
It is on Wednesday!
I had a few rest days.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the celebration of beer and the cider of Nottingham.
It was a substandard.
I have managed to disguise 19 different bids, Wobby Wesal being one of my favourite.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixture of people there, there was not only the fanatical fanatics (not to be confused with the camera's fanatics).
Cutting back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday evening we went to the grandfather of a pot to play the nard.
Thanks to a real chance of beginning, I have been able to go back with a number of people.
I hope that if I reach 95 years I will be as strong as he is.
Yesterday evening I went to a Cark cocktails in Farringdon.
One of my beverages has arrived with a leg of lens.
I admire Mr President
Listen a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, Mr Christian.
Having said that, without wishing to upset you, I believe that you are moving away from the subject.
This famous whole, it bans the queues for jihadists from the mosques.
It immediately points out arms trafficking.
Either we have a great deal of eyes, such as Meddeb and Taiwanese or Boubaku.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping the eyes of the eyes closed.
Excuse me, dear Christian, but once again you are making a monumental nonsense: all the authorities, organisations or associations, whether Muslim or not, having formally condemned the IAs and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
That is not a word.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not as French.
Unfortunately, dear Kovench Mervel, there is a doubt for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, there are doubts about the approval by the Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and indecent to blame them and demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the Republic and can only help to unlock French society.
There is no doubt, as I say.
Who does not say a word, but let us agree?
Congratulations with IAs or the condemnation of IAs.
The silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to put the goat and the knees.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatic.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, 'revenge' from the parties represented in Westminster, because a huge gap has increased between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be lauded.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely searching for Scotland because they have no basis.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I do not think that even Cameron is foolish enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who is going to pay a weapon for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the 'PROMESSE' thought he was rescuing his party but without realising that he signed the death judgment of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MEPs are asking their leader to account.
If the SNP gains 2025 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that is what is important.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Setting up the 8% pumps to the detriment of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
Moreover, once Scottish MEPs can no longer vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think it is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband.
Maggia did so with the Ulster Unionists and it was successful.
Yet he is still in a position to be Prime Minister in 2015 and he has won the Labour Party leadership.
So, in essence, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over his shoulders and see what he says, how he reads, and to the end.
It is' life of the others' of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC...
Still the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
In the long term, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I await the next ticket: Amazon produces VOTRE according to VOTRE, and automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secrecy!

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the management of the DRMs is not implanted, it remains a reading of pirate files, of the public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without mourning.
Given the price I have paid the Kobo, it is without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread ownership of their privacy.

@ Thomas: In the era of Big Data, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Let us be careful not to put all the literature in the same breath.
The gathering of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo, which is not allowed to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, false and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government over the last few days that the country seems to be led by a class of nursery nursery.
This is even worse if you take account of Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters believe that Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment, but not my own.
Of course - and this is the case - Turkey does not want to shoot itself up, unless it gains something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will be rife, then it is actually shooting itself.
A pension diplomat written on his blog: 'The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be wrong to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because that would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article if Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today Iran's and the US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.
The reading of Indian Punhine is to be strongly recommended to anyone who looks at the details rather than in the case of the traditional media in the traditional media, and the short article that you provide is important and should be read with the realistic and realistic remarks made from Iran to Afghanistan in 1979 - 1980.
Who are the 'moderates' who seriously combat the dreadful secular Assad and, at the same time, the perverse ISIS?
The pipeline policy is pushing the world into the abyss, and I would suggest to those who refer to the existing 'moderates' to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
'That is even worse than that if you take account of Erdogan's religious fundamentalism ', are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
There should be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
What should be done?
You realise that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being still alive?
A little late, my pot...
Are criminals not just old now, like 120 years?
A little late, not?
Particularly with regard to the CUP triumvirate, which planned and led the genocide, Talatat and Djemaal, killed just after the 1st World War on revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a packed place in Central Asia at the same time, when he went there and dreaming of a Turkish empire.
What is the point!
An impressive mastery of the fallacy of fatal slopes, but apart from that, we are trying to make contact with the real.
Let there be no argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart that is even fighting in the selling of a wearing mother.
lesbian couples can simply be a desire for children and not a desire to be accepted.
Unilateral couples too.
As for children!
It is a shame that they should be regarded as future psychological discord.
One day they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, earn a living and pay for the retirement of this lady.
The GPA is undoubtedly a temporary 'solution' in the evolution of medicine in our world.
It is not a date.
Many women have brought and put children who were not from their husband.
That is what we are doing.
The important thing here is that this practice should be controlled so that the 'commercialisation' of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics are not too commercialised.
Anakronik Farinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to get a good way of getting a good country off the ground via the Internet and Pay Pal than to shoulder its responsibilities and to avoid the scandal in another centuries close to home, without shutting it at that time on all the roofs!
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church!
It is not only Christians and believers who reject these practices...
However, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, that man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands I saw this only by far.

But if you like that and listen to music - that music today is always the same.
I do not know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mson says, perhaps they are being asked by people who have never been coolers, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the soccer which is awaiting your comments.
This is very true.
Since the film of Tony Parson, there has been a shortage of reporting that really reflects the reality of North England's culture.
It is no wonder that Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things.
The North Suthern still lives, but it has been vamphed by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface.
Having said that, you can make an ear if you are in the London region in November: 99pl will once again move from soul vineyles, including full from Northern Sul, on Saturday 15 November to the Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I, too, thought 'always the same story', but that is a small and well thought-out article.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
This is an article.
I have admitted your documentary.

The last train for Wigan de Victoria / Exchange and descending to Welsh.
By glossing over.
Whatever the station before Wigan, 15 miles from Wigan, after buying a ticket after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Suthern stage are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Ggenly called Grenly Northern Soul, which is in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly poisonous.
The Palestinian people have no peace partner.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never has an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@ Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace, since he wants to continue to occupy a colonization (incidentally, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred the settlement of the settlements to peace.
He took his clothes, the post on rock and entered water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative is going to anger and vote: 'What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there!
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiles and added: and now that things are clearly established clearly.
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower the guard...
It is obvious that this is not the aim of the anti-Israelis.
Anticonist: However, I have answered you: the world geopolitical report...
This has always happened since the policy is globalised...
Evidently, avoided...
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, that is certain, it is going on!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What strength of strength has the creation of Israel lost?
Anticonist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force of strength today!
You have no doubt!
In addition, it is not just about Russell Brand, but journalists in the Guardian seem to have difficulty going beyond anything that he does not have to say.
A lot of what he says is nothing but pseudo-chompeyists written in writing.
This shows that you do not understand what Russell Brand said, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It is just a continuation of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it well, which means that it is a question of immaturity).
A truly vicious burden, with just a suspicion that Russell Brand says some truths, perhaps truths that we prefer not to think about.
Please take it, this feeling will become increasingly widespread!
I can understand why Bhent horrified some: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious way and after all the nonsense of the tabloid, he does indeed give the impression that he is an early populist, but the whole story of not voting was completely misinterpreted in my view.
The general consensus seems to be that it is right for people not to vote and instead to take a stand and to ignore the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview with other articles and videos he has put forward, he says that to vote once every five years for Labour or the Conservatives (or Lib Days I presume) and limit the democratic commitment to that is completely unnecessary, the two parties (to slightly different degrees), which are essentially in favour
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with her solution (because I believe that being politically active by presenting his requests may go hand in hand with voting, given that politicians will change their minds if they really are at risk of losing the elections), but it is a pity to see all the condescending responses that say that this imminence that makes Jesus says to the young people not to take the trouble to vote.
The solution is extremely questionable, and it would be good if people were to debate what he actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people who are left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The vote on the vote was completely distorted.
I am deeply annoyed by the fact that it is not useful to slip a bulletin in a ballot every five years, since my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
Moreover, I challenge the idea that the words of Russell Brand are not the people (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-establishment academics from the counter-culture that Suzann would like to grouped together under the label 'pseudo-chompests'.
I am quite convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Perhaps that is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do as Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a v√©randa, with even the covert hosts of the monk!
Like Max Keer, who at the start attacked Russsel, but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to do it, it is all too easy to attack it without really understanding where he wants to come.
He is punishing in a political speech that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalised by the traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this' frontline 'shows, above all, that the intellectual debate has been held for a long time in history in history, where historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of the condensed type of Science Po.
For my part, I had seen the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdiu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to blame a culprit, a scapegoat.
They are developing one and the other of the very rational thinking, but this rationality is based on those scapegoats that are the cornerstone of their thinking.
I believe that for Foucaut the State was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the thought being sacrificed, which is also the magic thought.
The problem is solved in the report by eliminating it.
There is an anarchical, neo-lib and / or / libertarian slope (two words mark a tightening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowledge of which is to seek state aid for its markets) in the sense of the less state / not of any state in Foucault.
The old dream of the basis that is self-organised.
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it is not standing up.
He says that he is guilty of disposal, murder and sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Neither support.
The totalitarian left will remember the right old time, that of the god of then, Stalin, the small father of the people.
Oulala, you may have read a chunk too quickly if you took the Foucault texts on the Iranian revolution for Khomeini's apology.
Today, even Pierre Mante would no longer be amusing to attack Michel in this way...
Mr Gauchet raises a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether or not we agree with him is an original and respectable thinker.
It is quite ridiculous to see that cabal orchestrated by researchers in the human sciences of the hard left who do not bear the brunt of the allegiance to their mantra.
The narcotics and the authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
One important point to add seems to me to be the position of these 'rebels', which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other 'jails' that I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You have not had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I do not remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London, they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia, in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think of white white.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them who have spoken violently anti-Bush.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter, together with a Blanc.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and, above all, in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the large cities, and thanks to that prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians have, above all, prejudices against temporary workers without qualification from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in professions and in areas where they have a great chance of being exploited by their employers or facing high crime and violence.
Although I have lived on the shores of the River Ienissei in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of the Australians on the Chinese and the Aborigenes.
It is really bizarre that a foreigner tells me that I do not support the Chinese, when I met two in my life (one abroad), did not keep a bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice that I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who is meeting, all people are worth, how to remember who was who was.
You know what is bizarre?
Whether you and the Russian other are talking about the Chinese as a kind of single fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
Yet you always get out of it.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches in comparison?
No, because there is a great deal of chance that the parents of these Blocks will be able to take the initiative.
No measure of fairness in justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that is still being manipulated by strong groups on the left, such as the magistrate union...
It is a question of the exception, but the legal circles are quite frankly right.
When the courts of the magistrate only submit 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the enforcement of laws in the courts, it commits two obstacles.
Whoever takes the political view of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the judge.
Then it remains the law enforcement tool to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its inobserve in all the judicial acts of magistrates, including the public prosecutor, must make a distinction between the error and the partiality of magistrates.
It would be pointless to claim that justice is not divided between these three groups.
There is no objective analysis and lack of knowledge.
So if all this is not analysed, how then can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics that implicitly it is a little bit lower.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Aside from the sensitive nuisance of the nuisance that is given to the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area considered is the issue of the issue of the so-called 'third-party' segregation of inheritance, which has been committed until such time as there is scams in the case of the procedure for the procedure.
This profession gets a good EUR 150 million worth of EUR 150 million while benefiting from the covered coverage of the quasi-legal impunity of the French volunteer.
For the understanding of their mechanism, part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is in line with the so-called statistical improvement, which is to be found, in the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between generalisist and reluctant inheritance, a whole series of legal cases contrary to all the laws that are favourable to heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria not a form of lies?
Undoubtedly prohibitive prices.
There is still material to be used for the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of these tricycles, built on a measure of size and weight, and it has really enabled him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheeled wheelchair and tyres.
As we say, gates and colours...
Tanzchairi resembles what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Totchair looks like EPIQEU.
I think that the inventor of the Whill has never had to clean up a click of dog.
I am sure that my sister would love the whole area, but it is simply too expensive.
The long-distance wheelchair will be perfect for a disabled person with a pensioner.
Here there are hills.
Prices seem to be high, but there are really people who put such prices in a bicycle, so 'you see'.
I think it is particularly useful.
Not all disabled people are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance available.
Only if they have become disabled.
The bottom line is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practise high prices for things that they know full well.
We cannot really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive desks.
Unfortunately, it is just a draft, it is not intended to make it.
I am CONITT that the long-distance wheelchair is not on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this truthful fig.
Nearly 20 000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, in the intensive bombing of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people who are under 18 years old.
Children eight years ago have lived under Israeli blockade.
As a unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation, too, since this blockade is inflicting a 'collective punishment' on all civilians in Gaza.
'Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little from their cement to the black market '...
Ah it is not the wooden language, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support arguments or a fact.
Anticonist...
Good cement goes in tunnels!
The black market is certain, and recognised.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
As a unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) has excluded it!
Do not forget that, after having lifted it, Morsi had restored the blockade!
I am a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Bspeakers are Israeli,...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built towards the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you have thought well.
Couchoverg is much more cool than Airbus.
This is the very definition of the economy of sharing, with no profit.
Many are only looking for a night at Couchoverg.
So it is to be paid (or at least hope) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if the right addresses are to be sought.
Furthermore, owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and treat them directly in cash, thereby bypassing Airbus.
Where is the community in all that.
'What does it mean? '
No problem with the saying, what is the problem with your grammar?
We do not use the words' to let 'in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It is an international newspaper now, if you have not noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, ensure that it is 100% in line with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to carry out a commercial activity - what they will certainly refuse to do - and I have a boat and I have tried to find out how to praise it (in all honesty) on Airbus, in short, it is really a nightmare...
Did you think that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, bred and so on?
The pains are so slow that if someone tries to steal it it would always be close to where you left.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our arches...
Where are you going to do it?
No Marie Le Pen is right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150 000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who is defending who?
Who is defending what?
In 2017 the mass will be known!
Capitalism will not become poorer!
The high finance, speculating, is playing with our businesses, therefore, our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, our food, with our health care structures, with our debts, therefore, our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and by our money.
All this is for the benefit of the hyper-mega-obese of the flower.
Until the contrary, FH said: 'My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance'.
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Economy of the Economy as a former Scoschilld bank, a history of better defending the interests of the banksters, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else?
Do you know how to go back and reduce its panels?
Real and populist action
In fact, we do not know too much what Marie Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I am not sure that Spee really 'refused' to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed safe from the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massia in his book 'Castle of Steel' suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cuff√© in the area.
The sea was heated at the beginning of the day; I do not know whether it was still at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after the sun, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare that with the following battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photographs showing the survivors of being rescued, we see a calm and open sea.
Moreover, the saviors knew that there were no more German combatants at this stage.
Humm, that does not really correspond to what I remember to read on this battle, so I did a quick research on Wikipea:
'There was some confusion among German vessels about the fate of the two curified crusers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped the shooting, and a kid pursuit.
The Leipzig is living in the fire, but coming closer to it is that it was only a wreck.
The N√ºrberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the late battle and lives in Monmouth, which was thought and seriously damaged but still on the move.
After pointing out its spotlight on the flag of the ship, the proposal to go to the ship was refused and open the fire, ultimately sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the God Hope had to escape and stop research at 10.15.
There are reports of a British cuff√© in the vicinity, he went to the north.
So, if that is true, the Germans, in the darkness before the radar invention, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not seek survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important kitchen of the Royal Navy in the area that could have damaged them seriously, so in the confusion they disguise to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should go down a path through many of the Royal Navy vessels.
The sacrifice of Cracdok had already caused them to damage them, and had caused them around half of their munitions, thereby condemning them when they were finally taken.
There are a number of voices in the UMP calling for it to be enshrined in the law that a definitively convicted elected representative is therefore permanently ineligible.
That is a courageous position, which would also affect elected representatives of the left.
But nooon is a joke.
MAUR ETUC EDUE JE PROPE UNE IUU (UU DES DES)
When is the ban on trade unions in sectors already protected?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens?
Introduced by politicians, whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to amplify those very people who will benefit from their inamity in order to hinder the actions of real policies, which are really trying to get things moving, not the fine words of which the immobility is so much as sufficient.
I met them in the metro at midday with their small placards' under the heading of justice 'they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions, whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same arguments if right-wing, or even right-wing, trade unions were the target of personalities on their side and led to a judicial and media war.
Your statements are completely free.
If, at the moment, the right declares the current court of law, it is simply that it has committed facts.
We do not have an example of a left-wing person who had so much to do with justice but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not been treated in favour.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the magistrate union on the left is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
Let a minister support the trade unions with so much commitment.
The trade union that you mention is perhaps a minority one among the magistrates, but its influence is great to the Chancellor, it is not a secret.
We are now wondering whether the 'mission' of certain judges is not more salient rather than being educated.
You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
This is not the case: you forget that the magistrates are not officials like others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and to incarcate everyone.
Is Goody?
And if none of the participants ever came back?
Good day, Katim Wissel.
I believe that even the most glimmer of glory is aware that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone could accept their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directorate fill stadiums throughout the world.
Others then sold a lot of discs or went to West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, who is indeed one of the juices.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, C√©line Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opunnity Knocks launched most of the lighter entertainment stars on British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that is what happens in any case to most stars that do not participate in competitions.
Few people, after a tube, succeed in doing so.
In any case, most of the songs / groups can best hope for three albums and a bright.
No, but now Cole, or whatever its name, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes partly from his marriage with a footballer that is worse off.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
The end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to lead to a career than the typical process of rock, even though in your dreams you think that all foam fills that smoke from grass in the garage of their father and sweep three agreements on a poem at primary school will surely become stars, and that the only question is how much they want to touch even before it comes out of an albulm.
And worse than ludicrous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples - a distance that comes relatively quickly to racism, because sacrosanct ethnologists present us with these distant people as infinitely superstistious and petty of ritual bigotry, when most of their ways of doing so are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations.
If you look imprudently in the opposite direction.
Well, but rather than saying that the bumpy is not sacrosanct, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our oligarchs are not a little sacred?
It is as though we were reminded of the sacrosanct as a kind of well-defined objective and contained in the religious sphere.
It is very interesting.
It is deco epememe to mourn the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Thank you.
The recent Panthetisation of the Republic's figures is an illustration that the feeling of sacred is still alive.
Who still believes in the interpretation of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw out the misinterpretations of any scientists who last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a critique of the disciplines a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations of other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly being discovered, that there are valuable testimonies to rebuild history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This is not a very old method, and the archaeologists were used to their instincts and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays, we have such good technical and scientific resources that the interval of searches is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries.
We are in full (and old) polemics about the championship of the pre-historian Jean Clottes (cf his book 'Daws of prehistory', particularly the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, from the editions of the House of Rocks).
Thank you for this very instructive article
Are heterogeneous men love?
For you, I could do that.
So is it the end of the day?
I do not really understand why we cannot go on three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, for adults.
Do you really need to get into the caveat?
No, but we are not against a piece of theatre.

It seems that Mary Whitehead has returned to the dead.
Since your test offer is almost over, may I suggest that you move to Catholics.
I am sure you will feel more at home.
He prefers me.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc.
Rather than rifling with these purial saga.
Not very much.
Let us do that.
If these 'purial gages' are so shocking, you are not obliged to participate, is it not?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is perfectly possible to do both and to publish an article on gender.
Is it the subject that is shocking to you, or the fact that people are in the middle?
However, the video amateur the crash on the net...
A video amateur of the crash on the net...
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been able to get out of the bag because at the moment or another car, for example, it was on the circuit.
However, it was necessary to end the typhoon quickly before the typhoon was known, but for which the FOM did not think it was right to move forward with the time of departure (the right to fax, pub, money...).
But, apart from that, they are protecting pilots.
Of course, I also share that view.
But there is also the fact that, if the FOM is to get the SC into the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat the English that then led...
You are leaving my dear Dayton.
But that is not a serious matter, I have a little time to start all of your c Solven-Reform.
No, just not.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts Commissioners at risk of death for a long history of victory for a pilot to the detriment of another.
It is not the FOM that is out of the bag because it is the IIA.
A great deal.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of an image makes it possible, above all, for IIA to avoid troublesome issues of the kind: how is it that the Commissioner agitated a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the IIA is blocking the images of the accident, but because one of the Commissioners is clearly seen as a green flag, a sign that the race can normally resume and that we are more under a yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F1.
Yes, it is expensive, the race is no longer under a yellow flag, the place of the accident, and hence the green flag.
That is the usual procedure.
The post of commiseraries just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it may be 10m as well as 100meters after the accident) agitated the green to tell the pilots to take a normal line.
sensationalism is selling the pub.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the government's' patriotic 'propaganda offensive, but I am afraid that, ultimately, it is just for money.
And gender, let us not forget gender, fear of not having sexual life, the pub and the media are good to sell things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The infants do exactly the same.
Putting the buzz with infants, which we really do not need to care about, is right to continue to fear people so that they can continue to control them.
'When the tabloids sounder on Ebola, we are appealing to all fear ', it should be' derailed ', not' all '.
Given the medical reference, it is much better said in this context than 'derailing'.
I wonder whether all the people who are starving that Ebola can spread by air realise that they now believe in developments?
You do too much.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antenchrist!
You are confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
I would like to express my thanks to you.
A short and concise article that makes a mockery of this despicable pseudo-journalism.
That was a good thing.
It depresses me that the media talk about most things with this optimism.
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anguish (without getting the hysteria) for the government to get us off when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency without any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis without any proven case?
It seems that this government is seeking to save us from crises that it himself has invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations for the post, and to be still in this world almost 35 years later.
At the beginning it had to be horrible, given the context of the 1980-90 years.
I am bred, live with the certainty of going there for years...
It is completely unnecessary.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only does the testimony serve no purpose: it cannot be used as a scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
It is not a scientific material.
Perhaps that is why it is not possible to put questions to patients in psychiatry when reliable observations are made from the close.
My psychiatric dossier mentions that my psychiatrist is explain that I have been educated telepathically by her mother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say that it is the headline, it is a subjective subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (such as this testimony, which testifies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve any scientific purpose?
What do you base on research?
On fantasy?
Do you have the same level of fanciful theories and facts?
'Resilience ': the word' bid 'by grandmothers, the fans of J-L Delrue, who are taking place for great psychologists after reading D.
@ Jm: There is full of empty bazzwards in the psys.
Cyrulnik has put us on the knees.
As it is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have briefed us a reliable scale of measure to quantify it, that famous resilience.
I wonder whether the SNE could all save us from Farage and company?
Do you not think of Team America?
Strictly, it is not a good idea to draw up the air Sentils...
And why?
It was a brilliant series and it would seem that those who stand out are aware of this.
Let us leave it to the very powerful who can do miracles.
But how will they do so that children are cling?
The only solution that springs to mind is the pious humour, which would kill the series.
It was already a number of children.
Children were cling.
Ah, because it is a number of children?
UKIP work for Mysterons.
Take your Team America.
Also, in the case of Supera?
It will not be the same if we do not see the sons and the animation.
I look forward to seeing this (though an adulthood), but I hope that this will give the idea of a channel to spread the old.
The series has virtually never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since one hour on Saturday and on Sunday at 06.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-order commercial channels and it can always be seen at these times.
And, in addition to the episodes of half an hour, we now go to 5.30 p.m. from Monday to Friday!
Yes, I am probably a 'sad' 60 years, but I am not looking at this every day!
There is no 'Mount of the temple' in or under the mosque!
The radical Zionists invented this to give political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli searches below and around the patchwork mosque for decades have not helped to find.
The temple of the temple is there.
Can it be in Argentine?
It is not intended for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the patchwork of mosques was built.
His summit, or GDR's, is going through the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Mohammed has been in paradise from this rock.
For Jews, it is Moriah, where Abraham is failing to sacrifice his son Isaac.
From the moment it was taken and contextual, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind them of it regularly, and they are unfortunately reported to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avidor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter accepted the plan to 2 states, and has sounded it up.)
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognise the people?
The shortest Jewish joke: 'God is praised!'
In order to boast of tourism in Israel, we are often told by the half-hearted na√Øve, alanguies on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows, as we can see from the picture that illustrates the article.
It is a little afraid.
And this picture is a splendid piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the photographer of Reuters has not taken into photograph the hundreds of Palestinian people who are allowed to rally on the Mount Mount and who prefer to go down the Jewish faithful in contravention, praying to the wall.
If this picture bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper, the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transposes to us.
This system is not tenable and will end up.
The only way to put an end to this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be running out, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time, and without hiding, they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, that is not tenable, but it will change in that country only when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of ringing and mamming when someone else does the strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also about your employer, that you will not get people unpunished.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case, if it is tenable.
I fully agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India, for example.
All this cannot be done well.
It is because we are in democracy that it has been.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by bypassing national governments by secret courts.
It seems incredible, but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism for investors and states (ISDS) proposed by the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people to the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about it in the media: Independent Guarddian World Development is therefore the answer and you will understand what is being negotiated in your backs.
Did Churchill not say 'blood, sweat and tears'?
This is an excellent effect, when digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were trade unions in all the regimpositions of all.
In the highly Catholic French army, there is a dimension sacrificed.
Leave it (finally, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the coffer of France's eternal values, and it will fight and close its steam.
Then, with the decline of the country, globalisation, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this small link, is comforting.
Even though it is increasingly uncomfortable...
They still lack the snapshot of married men, caliaries, married women, caliaries, lost dogs, and I do not know what yet I do not know what yet.
If you do not write the French correctly, I am trade union.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
In order to defend the categorical interests we already have enough of the protected professions with trade unions, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of a civil servant.
One can very well imagine a system that guarantees freedom of expression without trade unions, or even without a right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, there is no disaster.
And with the charts that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Indeed...
I was referring to the military and other officials, because this is the subject that has been mentioned here...
Let us think 'through its delegates' in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become '8.
Every worker is involved in the collective determination of working conditions and business management.
This is absolutely essential with the eruption of information.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on a specific article entitled 'The Great British Bake Off'?
Look, the section was there.
I thought that the conversation was needed.
In any case, it is the marriage of Joffrey that I have looked at, and I can tell you that some have been well informed.
In the Joffrey marriage episode one of the best moments (though misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
So, of the late mesh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in which it is strange that the emissions end with a victory for the least worst baker; no one has done a 'mum', that is my cake.
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has ultimately had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these external people were kept separate.
And there is also the idea of 'playing security, there is always next week', which is disappearing last week.
I love to cook, but I do not think I am doing that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a super entertainment and make us try to try and try and try to get things right.
BBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge last year, the marriage cake, was absurd.
Professional professionals usually have days to do so, and they have to bail it out in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to share, I do not know how they were able to choose a winner.
In the case of Luis, the only real defect they could find was a rather dry basis (although I agree with Hollywood that the green ice on the mill of Richard was not envy, in any case Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to say that several challenges in this series seem to be somewhat artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also cancer, with solar wind.
Clearly, we are all successful at the moment.
It is a bad moment to go to humanity.
You are confusing solar and ultraviolet rays.
The UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is shaped precisely by the impact of residual solar and VV particulates.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to 'hunt' the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and 'cancer'.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect.
If we restrict ourselves to man, they have the interest of allowing us to have os (a synthesis of vitamin D), to heat us (less than the rubbish), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer is blocking carcinogens and leaving the UVA and most of the UVs.
You know that you are not obliged to be patronising and to look at your interlocutor as a stay when you make a comment?
Above all, for a minor clarification which was implied in the comment, which itself is intended to be pedagogical.
Not to say that I am an accustomed to melanchom, the UV only makes it a CEDELR.
They do not have the PROVONT.
As proof of this, all the bronised people do not necessarily have meltings.
Either, when a tubi tells you that we must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it is better not to listen because the UV is necessary for every human being.
Extraction, however, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV causes melanchom directly.
Is it possible?
And, more importantly, can we get it through?
or to move on to a joint venture...
I believe that the majority of those concerned have established that everything can be done if there is sufficient force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I believe that the army would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the IPhon6 as a communication material.
But for us?
That is a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested have established that everything can be done if there is sufficient force to apply sufficient force there.
Save a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already in place?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I have decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the teeth that I read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before specific software is installed, it is assumed that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain, and it is hard to see how it could return.
So, Hummmmmmmmmmm...................................................
The most likely thing is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been set up properly and is therefore stuck with the plant test code.
I do not know how they are doing this.
But would they put the test software on all?
The photographs on Ebasi clearly show the absence of CCC or EC logo and the presence of a prototype red link.
That is an excellent article.
We want cheap products, and we are surprised that industrialists produce in 'industrialists', but all the teachers and masses of small trade are affected by a good breath, bio savac EUR 1650.
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat it correctly with a small pay.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where he sees fit.
For my part, food is one.
Try without ransom,
You call bobs, or best boblolos, people who see the world through an ideological 'software' that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It is the total unbundling.
They are expert experts, for example, claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
It is also experts in a stagger, joining the gus-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example, by condemning CO2 emissions while passing their holidays to the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of excessive and staggering ideology, as well as being surprised to meet with criticism of them.
Wah, thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive theorisation, and for all the associated details (aeroplane, sweet...).
I would like to be one of them, but I do not find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boblololos are monobous.
You have understood the concept of gau-caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boblolo.
It is a perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were to take an interest in the ecolos.
Bobololo is a part of that, but it represents only the most visible section of the ecolos, because it is the one that infuses the media.
That is a fine slam.
Apparently, no one wants to look at it.
It is so badly made that it looks like a female nu.
You are next to the plate.
We must be part of the art of art to understand the staggering beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply do not have any legitimacy to comment, since you have not spent many decades studying and flattering large artists.
What is important is not the fact that Emin does not know and seems to be obsessed with the same subject.
What is important is that it has really managed to become a rich and famous person with no artistic capacity.
This is the issue of the issue of the issue of the issue of the Charter.
No, it is cochy.
The fact that Emitn does not know how to draw up the drawing up of the plan to draw up the design of Emin.
That is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing the fog.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
It is much more than just representing the real.
If you are looking for that, a photograph will do the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's exessionism.
Let us look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it with the kind of design you may prefer.
If that is so easy, why do you not?
There is still a need to make savings: the activities of equities, the number of doses of the Republican guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service...
The truth is that France is reducing its staff, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It is only half encouraging...
Operating without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, as we see the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local authorities concerned, which are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
This is what I was saying, but look at where to make savings but, above all, not at home, that is really not possible.
That is exactly what you are proposing to do, to look at where there is a certain amount of waste.
Let all those who have come up with a little or no military thing dare to come here and say that there is no money wasted in this perimeter, and that is not going to bury.
Let us apply the same potion to the whole public function and public finances will go a little better.
And for Joi: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why the defence can be given a bit of responsibility!
Bine yes, the economies on which everyone agrees that they must be done, must be seen somewhere, not?
It is a pot of pot, those on whom it falls to murder when it happens at home, the poor.
We should do this but, above all, it does not come above me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Yes, it is going!
In what way will the Val de Grathat weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As far as local authorities are concerned, history is repeated at every closing post, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is in favour of savings of course.
This is bizarre, a mayor UMP who wants compensation and does not look forward to the savings made in public spending.
This article really is the most astonishing truc I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment in which the first three people make the same bad joke.
It is the depressing to get rid of its Facebook thread and to see that 80% of its friends began their statutes with the phrase 'embarrassing moment'.
I believe they will make a film.
It will surely be based on holy scenes where someone comes out by chance of his ex ante in the bus by going to work and is only going to see that his jet has returned to his trousers.
It is not embarrassing, it is completely clear.
Not really, in my opinion, the author is taking the role of the British man typical of whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and keep his teeth.
I am sure that if you are a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence has been a strong one.
You realise that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have rights?
I do not have the Internet.
So I do not think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
My god, I have to make that film before I die!
I do not believe that this article is the most incredible truc I have ever read!
Charlie has just demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I would like to turn to the reverse!
It is absolutely essential that I agree with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the unbelievable creed and the insurmountable genius that jailed Mr Brooker's cloud as a divine light.
Well, that was really no.
Above all, if it is not women, nor is it the case.
I am a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associations.
So far, we have been confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play the stars at every bull to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things in hand.
Together with the Commissioner that they have planted energy, all these fine recommendations have been stolen...
Try: Eolian and solar farms are the Ronds of tomorrow.
All that is financed by the contrived.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
radioactivity is much more damaging to the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not fully controlled, it is better to restrict itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Is electricity from renewable to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsillon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GES in other stages and, above all, gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to offset the intermittent.
Removing nuclear power by renewable wind or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christine, I am not insulting to you, I am a State State of State in the physical sciences 1981, and I have carried out nuclear physics research, and I challenge you to prove contrary to what I have said.
For what I did not say to you, I did not say anything about Germany, but you did not respond to what I was saying and like all the right-wing people demolishing the contact I never do.
I would also mention the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and ineffective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and should be stopped.
If you do not count on the extraction of uranium and the construction, and if you do not count on the steam of greenhouse gases with less effect than Co2, it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is in steam water and a little in rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke about Pakistan as a 'giant of South Asia'!
Last time, Pakistan won against Himstan.
I am not surprised, most Indians who make comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, that shows your mindset.
It would have been such if they had described the giant India of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be opening a full Pandora's box of corruption and mafia.
As for the ISL, the opening match of today has been surprisingly interesting, the Aletico de Kolata, which is imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
In comparison with the billions and billions that India devotes to the PLA cricket and now football, how can we ever compete with our 'noisy neighbours'...
The race for the low cooking is paid out.
It is a shame for such a fine project.
In the case of the incident, the possible lack of design can only be seen with too cold a helium.
So perhaps it is not a design defect, but implementation...
Unlike arianspace that is a private company, it seems that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as it is, it is its own insurer.
They will be able to pay the satellite-based satellites that know.
This is all the more annoying because many media are hiding the headlines of articles, and many readers only retain these securities.
All this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I fully agree with you that the title is not appropriate, it is unjustly calling into question the project, whereas it is only a problem of lane.
