S@@ pec@@ t@@ as@@ ar leap in &apos; wal@@ king &apos; above Bo@@ go@@ ta
The sport , J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lor@@ ez , has died on Thursday of a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter above Bo@@ go@@ ta , the Colombian capital .
E@@ qui@@ p@@ posed by a w@@ in-@@ win ( a combination of ai@@ des ) , it went to 160 km / h above the famous Mon@@ ser@@ ra@@ te sanc@@ tu@@ ary , located at more than 3 000 metres of al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ ges gathered to observe its fe@@ at .
A black box in your car ?
While the pl@@ ann@@ ers of the United States &apos; road network find it difficult to find the money needed to repair the self-@@ dec@@ im@@ it@@ ude infrastructure , many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the table of your car .
The appli@@ ances , which have all the miles travelled by an motor@@ ist and trans@@ mit information to officials , are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main American roads .
The sector generally without interest in the planning of major a@@ xes has suddenly caused a lively debate and turbul@@ ent alliances .
The liber@@ tarian groups have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use the small bo@@ xes to keep a trace of the miles you leave , and possibly the road to which you circul@@ ate , then to use the information to draft a tax bill .
The Te@@ a Party is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And while the members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
They are looking at how , over the next decade , they can switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of motor@@ ists have already embarked on these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with a G@@ PS monitoring system , for an experimental vice .
This is really essential for our nation .
&apos;@@ It is not as if we had the choice &apos; , said H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ ra@@ ta , Director-General of the Su@@ ther@@ n California Association , who states that the state is starting to register the mir@@ rors travelled by every single car driver by 20@@ 25 .
There will be change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the High@@ way Fund of the country , financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the p@@ ump , is financially dry .
The Americans no longer buy as much petrol as before .
Ve@@ hic@@ les can travel more miles with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are reluctant to increase the tax , even 1 % , while petrol prices are high .
&apos;@@ The tax on petrol is simply not tenable &apos; , said Le@@ e M@@ un@@ n@@ ich , a transport policy specialist at the University of Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
His state has recently inst@@ alled trac@@ es of 500 cars to test a payment system in the m@@ ould .
&apos;@@ This is the most logical long-term alternative &apos; .
W@@ on@@ ks calls for the use of a kil@@ ome@@ ter .
It is not surprising that the idea is se@@ duc@@ ed by the Liberals , as taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious state laws on global warming .
But the chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives has said that he is the most viable long-term alternative .
The supporters of the Foundation &apos;s free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay .
&apos;@@ It is not just a tax on a large black hole &apos; , he declared A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , the vice-@@ president of the policy at the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided to them .
The movement is also supported by two former US secre@@ tar@@ ies in transport , which , in a 2011 report , urged Congress to go down the path of payment .
The US Senate approved a pilot project of USD 90 million last year that would have brought about 10 000 cars .
But the presidency of the House has killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or to the city .
However , several states and large cities are making progress on their side .
The most determined is O@@ reg@@ on , which mobilised 5 000 drivers to lead the country &apos;s most important experiment .
These motor@@ ists will soon pay for the system of kil@@ ome@@ tric costs instead of taxes on petrol .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
The city of New York envisages one .
The Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is trying to test a limited number of lorries .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 Co@@ ali@@ tion , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states extending the US coast ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) exam@@ ines how it could implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where around 50 voluntary car drivers recently f@@ itted their cars with a equipment , drivers were concerned that the government could follow their worst facts and gest@@ ures .
&apos;@@ concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and this kind of thing is a big problem &apos; , said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din K@@ han , who runs the strategic management of performance in the Department of Transport of N@@ ev@@ ada .
That is not something that people want .
From the beginning of the trial , the AC@@ L@@ U in the N@@ ev@@ ada warned on its site : &apos; It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into a proper loc@@ alisation system &apos; .
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep the records of people &apos;s homes and daily arri@@ vals .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is one of the few states that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many mi@@ xes run a car , but without knowing the place or the time .
If you can do that , he added K@@ han , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to use a small start-@@ up start-@@ up of California , the name of Tra@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society was not intended to help motor@@ ists who pay taxes to the Member States .
It sought to per@@ severe in the emerging market of self-@@ insurance , where drivers would pay for their kil@@ ome@@ ter .
However , the devices it te@@ aches have pl@@ anted the pl@@ ann@@ ers of the major a@@ xes because they do not use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , perio@@ dic@@ ally down@@ loaded by motor@@ m .
&apos;@@ People will be more inclined to do that if you do not register their speed and do not loc@@ ate them &apos; , said R@@ y@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , Director General of Tra@@ ue Mil@@ age .
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some states .
There are much cheaper means and much less intru@@ sive methods of doing this .
In O@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers are trying to experience their experience by offering car drivers different choices .
They can choose a de@@ vice with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have any apparatus at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all the residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing equipment to do more , rather than enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for par@@ king charges , provide a &apos; payment payment &apos; insurance and create a set of data on a real rate of speed from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid congestion .
&apos;@@ Au@@ tom@@ ob@@ ists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them &apos; , a document on urban planning .
However , some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers are wondering whether the whole debate about the payment of mine is simply a huge diver@@ ge .
In the Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an T@@ ran@@ sit Commission of the San Franc@@ is@@ co Bay area , those responsible say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund by increasing taxes on petrol .
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol , so that everyone pays their fair share .
&apos;@@ There is no need to resort to radical sur@@ ger@@ y when you simply need aspir@@ in &apos; , said Mr R@@ Ã©@@ ch@@ ler , the director of the law and public affairs in the committee .
If you do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about the protection of their privacy and about a lot of other things .
David Bow@@ ie :
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an has not come to an end this year .
From The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , in January , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a luxury re@@ edi@@ tion that was planned for 4 November , with a number of new ones .
Four have already emerged on the To@@ l .
The announcement of a new al@@ bul@@ m of David Bow@@ ie left the whole of the pan@@ els .
On the day of its 6@@ 6@@ th birth@@ day , on 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ bul@@ m would emerge in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last one , Re@@ ali@@ ty , dates of 2003 ) and too few public appearances , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an proved that we could still count on him to bring the po@@ p up .
A f@@ es@@ tive for its f@@ ans
Not as a result of sur@@ prises , David Bow@@ ie had more in his s@@ ack with The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay .
In this way , the Th@@ in White Du@@ ke plans to re@@ construct this al@@ lude on 4 November .
On the occasion he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a true f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans .
This re@@ publication , entitled The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a , will be presented in the form of three dis@@ cs : the original al@@ bu@@ m , unprecedented stu@@ di@@ o sessions and tow@@ ers , as well as a D@@ V@@ D containing the four cli@@ ps already un@@ covered .
The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a will contain a total of ten additional ti@@ t@@ les compared with the original al@@ pha@@ m : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x@@ x edi@@ tion , five s@@ ong@@ s specially un@@ ve@@ iled for the opportunity , and two tow@@ ers .
David Bow@@ ie made the presen@@ tations of this beautiful co@@ ff@@ in in a video .
It introduces both the record and the acc@@ ess@@ ories provided with : exclusive photo@@ graph@@ s and po@@ to@@ ons , a car@@ net to share his own im@@ pres@@ sions , a re@@ statement with words ...
And , above all , it gives a fore@@ taste of its new title At@@ om@@ ica , typically in the ve@@ in of The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , with very strong gu@@ ides and a ro@@ ck@@ y electricity .
In@@ come
But At@@ om@@ ica is not the only title to reveal his arms .
The In@@ forming , Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ck M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O are also available on the web .
The In@@ form is in the dark : a worrying in@@ sid@@ er prior to a light ca@@ val@@ ier that is gradually slowing down to leave a po@@ p po@@ p .
In Li@@ ke A Ro@@ k@@ t M@@ an , did we want to make a small reference to the Ro@@ ck M@@ an of El@@ ton John , or indeed to Great ?
With this title , the sing@@ er seems at least to be in his point when he has no feet on earth .
S@@ Pope O@@ d@@ di@@ ty , on the other hand , was much more serious .
On Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , David Bow@@ ie again referred to his str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold : would he come from another planet ?
There is a desire to leave the earth .
In any case , we are in the process of playing a cam@@ era with these ti@@ t@@ les : an informal tow@@ er , a man on board a f@@ us@@ s , a Mar@@ tian potential ...
It conce@@ als and reveals both , plays a different person@@ alities , as he has done throughout his career , especially with his figures Z@@ i@@ gg@@ y St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ on@@ n S@@ ana .
It is not surprising that he has a m@@ ask of hand in the photo@@ grap@@ h of the campaign in the V@@ y@@ age , the brand Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , of which he embo@@ dies the new face .
It will appear in one of their adverti@@ sements , broadcast from 10 November .
The Minister of Defence , Ro@@ b Nichol@@ son , insisted that the w@@ ounded soldiers were not rou@@ tin@@ ely released from the Canadian Ar@@ med For@@ ces , and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before returning to civil life .
At@@ t@@ ached by Liberals and Democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr Nichol@@ son ensured that , before their release , the members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
All the injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life , and none of them is released before being ready , he said .
The critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the w@@ ounded military - who do not meet the rule of &apos; the univers@@ ality of the service &apos; of the army demanding that staff be able to carry out a number of different tasks - to reach the 10 years required for pension provision .
In particular , they mentioned two cases reported by the Pres@@ se Canad@@ ians , including that of a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Corpor@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a London reser@@ vis@@ t , in On@@ tari@@ o , reached post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year more so that he can receive a fully inde@@ xed pension .
His case came to light after that of Corpor@@ al G@@ l@@ en Kir@@ ci@@ a , who said before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before he was ready because he did not meet the universal rule of service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared to leave , with plans and consultation sessions , but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;@@ I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said in a meeting with the Pres@@ se Canad@@ ians on Wednesday .
I asked for months if there was a way to stay , and they said no .
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has been struggling to determine which la@@ titude it can give the injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks , but who are not able to fight .
Under the current rules , the seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deploy@@ ments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented last year in Parliament indicate that , among the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons , 19@@ 9 had not reached the time required to obtain pension benefits .
The liberal spokes@@ person on former combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked for the reintegration of Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins on Wednesday , while the neo-@@ democr@@ at J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for the immediate end of &apos; this shameful practice &apos; .
Dis@@ ney t@@ ab@@ lets to launch a series of anim@@ ated series
The American media and enter@@ tainment group has decided to give the t@@ ab@@ lets to its own television channels for the next round of children .
The first nine episo@@ des of S@@ her@@ i@@ ff , Wil@@ d W@@ est , will be available from 24 November on the w@@ at@@ ch@@ dis@@ n@@ y@@ j@@ un@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m site or via its application for tele@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
Its global launch on the Dis@@ ney Group channels is only planned in 2014 , details of the communi@@ qu@@ Ã© of its Dis@@ ney J@@ uni@@ or division .
The lively car@@ to@@ on , intended for children of 2-@@ 7 years , tells the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the Ch@@ ate@@ e C@@ all@@ y , sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of a city in the American west , where it puts the order in order with a magic l@@ ass@@ o .
Every episo@@ de includes two 11 minutes .
&apos;@@ Inter@@ vention with s@@ mar@@ ph@@ ph@@ es and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commen@@ ded Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , Vice-President for digital products at Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , quoted in the communi@@ qu@@ Ã© .
This kind of experience between the Dis@@ ney efforts to &apos; expand the life of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important &apos; , has added .
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Comm@@ on Sen@@ se Me@@ di@@ a showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of the less than two years have already been used by a t@@ ab@@ lets or telephone , and 72 % of the less than 8 years , compared with 10 % and 38 % respectively .
S@@ now@@ den is ready to &apos; cooperate &apos; with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lowing of US intelligence services , said that he was prepared to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director K@@ e@@ it@@ h Alexander were not provided with answers on their activities .
The German Member Hans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ Ã¶@@ be@@ le met Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia on Thursday , where he has the right of asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter that the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a flight and seeks to penalise political dis@@ course with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . &apos;
However , telling the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against him .
As part of the complaint lod@@ ged by the US Department of Justice , he is accused of sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of state goods .
Hans@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich , the German Interior Minister , said at Z@@ e@@ it On@@ line : &apos; If Mr S@@ now@@ den is prepared to speak to German officials , we will make sure that we do that . &apos;
Relations between the United States and Germany were put to a severe test following complaints that the N@@ SA had been listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
Thomas O@@ p@@ hot@@ n , the Member who heads the parliamentary group super@@ vising the foreign secret services , said that if there was a chance to hear Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness &apos; without putting it at risk and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States &apos; , we should take advantage of it .
Mr Stra@@ Ã¶@@ be@@ le , a German Green , published a photo@@ grap@@ h with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
When he visited Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr Stra@@ Ã¶@@ be@@ le said that , according to the lawyer of the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Mr S@@ now@@ den could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den testi@@ fied in Germany , he would have to give him the assurance that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , said the Member .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a &apos; serious and sustained &apos; persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global response to &apos; my act of political expression &apos; .
Citizens throughout the world , as well as the senior officials - including the United States - found that the re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was of public uti@@ lity .
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able could soon offer the inter@@ active down@@ stream
The subscri@@ bers of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able may well have access to applications such as Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter and ultimately the vide@@ o service on the demand for Netanyahu via their television in a future that is not so far away .
The subsidiary of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of this platform of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;@@ This will allow us to highlight more us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces , as well as more options &apos; , explained the President and head of the management of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , Lou@@ is Au@@ d@@ et .
In this way , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able is following up to its competitors , such as B@@ ell@@ l , even though the subsidiary of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o has not yet had a precise date for this new platform .
&apos;@@ We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail &apos; .
The ultimate aim is still to provide tools to which our customers do not currently have access .
The telec@@ oms giant Ro@@ gers has already indicated that he could offer Netanyahu if some technical details , which have not been mentioned , could be solved .
In the United States , the television service says that it is in discussions with some major c@@ ages so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
The p@@ .@@ be@@ .@@ g@@ . de Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ Ã¢@@ able also welcomed the announcement by the Har@@ per Government in its Tro@@ j@@ ine speech on 16 October .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force c@@ able and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the card services .
&apos;@@ It is about two and a half years ago that we are saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains , that is not working &apos; , has said Mr Aud@@ et .
However , it hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations and T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations Council ( CR@@ T@@ C ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;@@ He will have to emerge from these discussions a new frame of reference for defining our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television &apos; , said the p@@ .@@ C@@ . de Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o .
The CR@@ T@@ C has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring .
On the side of the results , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o indicated that there was a net benefit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 .
This is a step backwards compared with the net benefit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million , or 83 % per action , of the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this decline by means of am@@ or@@ tization costs linked to new acquis@@ i@@ tions .
In 2012 , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o acquired the B@@ lan@@ c Bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and c@@ able , established in the United States , for 1.@@ 36 billion .
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal .
Last December , it also bought Pe@@ er 1 Network En@@ ter@@ prise , an Internet supplier established in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , for the sum of 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o &apos;s revenue , they grew 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter to reach 50@@ 4.@@ 7 million .
They are EUR 1.@@ 8 billion .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able , was 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 % per action , in retro@@ spec@@ t compared with the 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million , or 93 .
However , the revenue from Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able has increased by 45 % to EUR 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 customers in the fourth quarter .
However , for the financial year 2013 , the number of customers in Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able is 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Aud@@ et is not concerned about the number of customers fluctu@@ ating in this way .
For me , it is not the indication of a change of trend , he has observed .
It varies from one quarter to the other with very strong competition .
From the horse to beef
S@@ hor@@ t meat has been found in bo@@ vine can@@ ned bo@@ xes , sold by two small , low-@@ price British prof@@ essors , announced today the food hygiene agency .
P@@ rac@@ tical tests have revealed that products , drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the H@@ om@@ eland and Qu@@ ali@@ ty Sa@@ ve chains , were contained in the DNA DNA of a maximum of 1 to 5 % .
&apos;@@ Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the British agency .
A scandal of the presence of hor@@ ses in k@@ ick@@ -@@ be@@ ats broke in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests in Ireland .
According to European Commission exam@@ inations , France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that were supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles resulted in four injured , early on Friday , on road 1@@ 31 , in Lan@@ audi@@ Ã¨re .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ th , a motor@@ ist who was circul@@ ating in the north , in Sain@@ t-@@ F@@ eli@@ de de Val@@ is , lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occup@@ ants of both vehicles were injured , but there was no fear for their lives .
The traffic was returned to normal to 6@@ th , Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make up to $ 100 to passengers carrying hand lu@@ gg@@ age on their flights .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plan to start making up to $ 100 for a hand@@ -@@ b@@ agg@@ age and $ 2 for a coffee or a so@@ da , although in its announcement on Wednesday , it indicated that passengers could take the un@@ opened can@@ e with them to the flight .
The new b@@ agg@@ age costs concern bag@@ s in the upper compar@@ tment , so the small bag@@ s in the seat will always be free .
Fron@@ tier said that it would pay $ 25 if the costs were paid in advance and $ 100 if the travellers were only paid once on board .
The Fron@@ tier spokesman , K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley pointed out that the USD 100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance .
&apos;@@ We do not want to pay that price &apos; , she explained .
Air@@ lines have started to make the first and second lu@@ gg@@ age recorded in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who were trying to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in their hand lu@@ gg@@ age in higher compar@@ tments , so there was often no room for them in these compar@@ tments .
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board .
They said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a matter of making the customers of Fron@@ tier B@@ orders understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the superior compar@@ tments .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger in a bo@@ arding bo@@ y could transport a ba@@ g free of charge , while the next person in the qu@@ e@@ ue could have to pay USD 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
It has explained that the site and the border registration procedures are changing in order to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they reach the door .
B@@ order lu@@ gg@@ age costs will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often run on b@@ agg@@ age and other charges , but the airlines are ad@@ mitting them .
They believe that the costs of handling b@@ agg@@ age are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for it .
Many people in Wall Street regard the addition of b@@ agg@@ age charges as a sign that the airlines are paying enough for the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them have not touched on b@@ agg@@ age costs .
S@@ pi@@ rit Air@@ lines In@@ c@@ . had applied the first hand b@@ agg@@ age costs three years ago , and the L@@ ow@@ -@@ co@@ at company was followed a little later .
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , which has declared the consul@@ tant to the airlines of J@@ y S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , which is closely following the costs .
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that S@@ pi@@ rit &apos;s hand@@ -@@ b@@ agg@@ age costs were USD 50 per year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former framework in Mid@@ west Air@@ lines , recently travel@@ ed on S@@ pi@@ rit and won@@ dered what it was going to find at the bo@@ arding door at a time when passengers would discover the un@@ accustomed hand@@ -@@ outs imposed by the company .
&apos;@@ I had never seen a bo@@ arding procedure so flu@@ id in all my professional career &apos; .
I was expecting some te@@ eth and b@@ agg@@ age to bur@@ st .
The aeroplan@@ e was full , he added , &apos; the passengers were on board at the speed of clarity &apos; .
B@@ orders also do like S@@ pi@@ rit and apply costs of USD 2 for a coffee , a th@@ a , a so@@ da or a fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier has indicated that passengers who take a so@@ da or a fruit ju@@ ice can take the un@@ open can@@ e with them , and those who take coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
US Air@@ ways made a short attempt to make drinks pay in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline had followed .
The Fron@@ tier decision to make b@@ agg@@ age fees pay when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is the last effort to encourage customers to go on their website .
The airlines pay for online travel ven@@ d@@ ors like Or@@ bi@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for every ticket sold .
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of talking to an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier went further in this area .
In September , it began to offer only half of the loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it reduced the number of mi@@ xes by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a Fron@@ tier 1@@ 000 mile trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the B@@ orders site .
B@@ orders have a true cli@@ ent in its home town , Den@@ ver , but its activity is declining and is losing money .
The revenue has fallen by 9 % and its flight capacity has fallen by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its mother company , Public Air@@ ways Hol@@ dings In@@ c .
Re@@ public has tried to redress Fron@@ tier finances by selling the airline .
The N@@ SA
The National Security Agency , working in the shad@@ ows , said on Friday that it was a bu@@ g that caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , and not ha@@ ck@@ lers as some had claimed online .
&apos;@@ N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v remained in@@ accessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a planned update &apos; , indicated the sp@@ ying agency in a statement by em@@ ail .
The problem will be solved this evening .
The allegations that the breakdown was due to an attack on the denial of service is false .
Ear@@ lier this evening , the online ser@@ vers of online ser@@ vers noted that the N@@ SA site had been broken for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokesman indicated to A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the agency &apos;s sensitive internal network was not a compromise at all .
No classified information is at risk , explained the spokesman .
At least a group of online h@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts has claimed to be responsible for the P@@ SA &apos;s breakdown with a D@@ S@@ D attack .
The D@@ S@@ D attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
Cy@@ ber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system .
The N@@ SA used to be a secret secret , a time called the &apos; N@@ o Su@@ ch A@@ gen@@ c@@ y &apos; , has found itself under the spot@@ light and strongly criticised in recent months following a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its extensive communications surveillance programmes at national and foreign level - which are part of the N@@ SA secret files stolen from the agency and dis@@ closed by the former dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed consul@@ tant of the N@@ SA , Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
This growing controversy around the agency has caused a lot of speculation that this evening &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
The Del@@ ta C@@ enter now closed
The Del@@ ta C@@ en@@ -@@ V@@ ille ho@@ tel closed on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that had the edi@@ fic@@ e sold it to promo@@ ters who will turn it into a student house .
Three hundred and fifty people worked in ho@@ tel .
Of these , 200 have still not found new jobs .
Del@@ ta promises not to let his employees fall .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers have come to meet with employees directly on the ground , they have met the employees individually to assess their needs .
&apos;@@ This will continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the Ho@@ tel Del@@ ta , F@@ eli@@ x B@@ son .
The closure of the Del@@ ta comes in a very competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that was the owner of that building had a choice to make .
Either he re@@ invested in building to continue to operate , so there were tens of millions of investments when competition is very fierce , there are many new hot@@ els who appeared in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&apos;@@ Either either he or she would sell it to someone else , and that is what happened &apos; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ul@@ t , the holder of the tourism tourism company Trans@@ at to the E@@ Q@@ A@@ M A@@ I@@ C .
Other hot@@ els in Mon@@ tre@@ al will also be converted into the next few months , such as the Po@@ int P@@ la@@ za , which will become a residence for the elderly .
In the meantime , four ho@@ tel projects with almost 600 cham@@ bers will be established within two years .
For the CE@@ O of Ti@@ tan , &apos; Go@@ od@@ d@@ ar A@@ mi@@ ens &apos; purchasing project is starting with zero employees &apos; .
Having thrown the issue together in January for the partial resumption of the Go@@ od@@ e@@ ar site promised to close , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , the CE@@ O of the American P@@ len@@ ary Ti@@ tan , is now prepared to save 3@@ 33 jobs on the 1 137 of the plant .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ burg , the Minister for productive recovery , had already announced this , on Monday , 21 October .
Having given up the plant &apos;s purchase project in January , you are now returning .
You made violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about &apos; so-called workers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; mad trade unions &apos; , with the C@@ G@@ T .
This is not understood .
Is it to please Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Sa@@ ve my wife .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg , is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
I am sorry to have been w@@ ounded by someone .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Is the truth ?
Working seven hours a day when other countries are working eight hours ha@@ mp@@ ers France .
In India , China and the rest of other countries , 10 to 12 hours a day are being employed .
But I have no prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is well situated and has space to grow .
Why is it so necessary for the plant ?
There is no need to buy this plant .
But , with the right price and the competent workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar had given employees a good start , I think 100 % of the employees would have accepted it .
Now let us imagine that Ti@@ tan is buying Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar the closed plant .
Therefore , Ti@@ tan could move the machinery to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency .
I think Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg knows that .
He wants to keep the factory in A@@ mine with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid jobs .
T@@ ot@@ an agrees to recru@@ it them among the approximately 1 200 current Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar employees .
Therefore , Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a commitment from Ti@@ tan before trying to bring the C@@ G@@ T to the table with Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar .
The first step is that the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar are se@@ izing an agreement on starting allowances for all employees .
Then there will be no more employees in the plant .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm that ?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four@@ -year guarantee .
But , as I have said , the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar must first agree on starting allowances .
If all employees accept them , the plant &apos;s purchase project is starting with zero .
How can we give guarantees of working time when there are no longer any employees on the site ?
If Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg succe@@ eds in ensuring that the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ ed@@ ar come to an agreement and that Ti@@ tan is buying the plant , then we intend to stay in A@@ mixed North over four years .
The benefit of B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er is falling , while the deli@@ veries and orders of aeroplan@@ es go back and go backwards .
B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er In@@ c , the Canadian aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical and rail buil@@ der , pointed out a 15 % fall in its net benefit on Thursday , under pressure from a reduction in orders and deli@@ veries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Tra@@ ins .
B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , has also not provided any flight test data for his or her new aeroplan@@ e , C@@ Ser@@ ies , or information to know whether the aeroplan@@ e will meet its ambitious schedule for commercial service until September .
After the air plane &apos;s inaug@@ ural flight around a month and a half ago , it only stolen three times , and the question then asked whether the test phase was on the right track .
The results have not been up to the forecasts and the course of action has fallen by 8 % to the Tor@@ onto Ex@@ change .
Cam@@ on Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , an analy@@ st in the National Bank of Financial Bank , low@@ ered his rating , from &apos; over@@ performance &apos; to &apos; industry performance &apos; , because of the low potential for increasing the stock market in the next quarter or two quarters .
&apos;@@ Although the reduction in aircraft deli@@ veries has been largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the T@@ ran@@ si@@ tional division &apos; , said Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a note to customers .
We believe that B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er will record new orders for its C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft as the flight test programme advances .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
B@@ om@@ b@@ oring hopes that the family of the Ser@@ b aircraft will be able to cat@@ ap@@ ult in the lower seg@@ ment of a market that is now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test aeroplan@@ e was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and was first in September after months of delay .
However , the number of firm orders for the Ser@@ b aircraft is modest up to 17@@ 7 , and it seems that potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to valid@@ ate the claims of society regarding energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new online aircraft .
At the moment , society has recorded a total of 40@@ 3 orders and purchasing commitments from 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ au@@ n , President and head of the management , is convinced that B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the first aeroplan@@ e is used .
The leaders also reassured the analy@@ sts and the media on Thursday that the programme was progressing according to the timetable .
&apos;@@ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than expected &apos; , said Mr Be@@ au@@ au@@ n at a telephone conference , adding that ground tests and software up@@ dates were planned during the flight time .
Each manufacturer is planning differently .
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and to provide for an update period , and that is what we have done .
This will happen throughout the flight programme .
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks , the others will follow shortly afterwards , which has indicated society .
Yet analy@@ sts are sceptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a C@@ Ser@@ ies aeroplan@@ e only 12 months after his inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er has indicated that it is assessing the timetable for entry and will provide new information in the coming months .
&apos;@@ This slow@@ ness of trial on the flight - although it is apparently in line with the internal calendar of B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er - reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015 &apos; , said Mr Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
In the third quarter , on 30 September , the net benefit of B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er fell to USD 14@@ 7 m , or 8 c@@ ents per action , compared with 17@@ 2 M , or 9 c@@ ents per year .
The result of adjusted action has remained unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
incomes have fallen slightly from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 M@@ dollars .
The analy@@ sts expected a result of 10 c@@ ents per action and revenue from USD 4.@@ 56 , according to Thom@@ son Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / E / S@@ .
The fourth aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical manufacturer in the world indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter , compared with 57 a year earlier .
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft , compared with 83 before .
The delay in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical division was 3@@ 2.@@ 9 M@@ from to 30 September , a figure that is unchanged on 31 December of the previous year .
&apos;@@ In A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing &apos; .
A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical incomes have fallen by 13 % to USD 2 M@@ dollars .
B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , has said that the income of this division has increased by nearly 11 % to USD 2.@@ 1 .
The orders for the T@@ ran@@ sit division total 3@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ from to 30 September , which is a slight increase compared with 31 December of the previous year .
The margins of the T@@ ran@@ sit division have suffered problems of execution with regard to some large contracts .
The leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter .
The course of B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er &apos;s actions , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ch@@ et@@ te , head of the financial management of Google In@@ c , would sit on the board , fell from 8@@ .5 % to USD 4.@@ 83 in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazilian society , the third aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical manufacturer in the world and the ne@@ arest competi@@ tor in B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er , indicated on Thursday a 10 % drop in its quar@@ terly benefit .
Two s@@ wa@@ elec@@ olog@@ ists of 23 and 27 years were missing in a cha@@ s@@ m under the De@@ ath of C@@ l@@ ass since Thursday evening , we have learned on Friday at the S@@ P@@ elec@@ li@@ o rescue of the Is@@ land .
They were located on the Friday afternoon .
The two men , who have been in practice in practice and the other no , were left on Thursday at 9.@@ 30 p.m. to carry out a crossing of the D@@ ate of C@@ l@@ ass , located on the St Pi@@ er@@ re de Char@@ ran@@ te .
Then there was no news from them since then .
&apos;@@ The sp@@ ag@@ e@@ olog@@ ists should have come up at around 5@@ th of the morning &apos; , said Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry L@@ arre@@ be , technical advis@@ er to the S@@ P@@ elec@@ li@@ o rescue aid .
T@@ ens of people on the ground
There were two dozen rescue workers , ten civilians from the French S@@ p@@ Ã©@@ li@@ o rescue , as well as polic@@ emen , C@@ R@@ S and fire bri@@ g@@ ades .
At the end of the afternoon this Friday , the two s@@ wa@@ ge@@ olog@@ ists were loc@@ alised .
&apos;@@ It is another group of sho@@ e@@ olog@@ ists who , after having found their way out but healthy in the c@@ av@@ ity , sent information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network &apos; explains the D@@ au@@ ph@@ or@@ us .
The two military in the 13@@ th bat@@ tal@@ on of Cha@@ b@@ Ã©@@ ry &apos;s Al@@ ph@@ Ã©@@ ry , were found &apos; exhausted , but not injured &apos; .
They lost out in the network , returned to their steps while waiting for relief , made the pre@@ fec@@ ture clear .
Con@@ fu@@ sted , they should come out of hand with the help of rescue workers in the evening .
German journalists
The German journalists &apos; union invited its members on Thursday to stop using the online services of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o after further re@@ vel@@ ations about the activities of US and British intelligence services .
&apos;@@ The German Federation of Jour@@ n@@ alists recommends to journalists that they should not be able to use the search engines and mess@@ eng@@ ers of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o &apos; , says in a statement .
It considers the information from Washington Po@@ st to be &apos; scandalous &apos; , according to which the US National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) and the United Kingdom &apos;s He@@ ad@@ quarters He@@ ad@@ quarters ( G@@ C@@ H@@ Q ) have collected information m@@ asses by inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating international networks that allow both companies to syn@@ chron@@ ise their ser@@ vers .
&apos;@@ Research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &apos; , added Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ k@@ en , the Chairman of the trade union , who claimed 3@@ 8@@ ,000 members .
F@@ ine : a Member requests the resignation of Bri@@ gi@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els
The project of Minister Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els of &apos; connec@@ ting &apos; po@@ les of traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone .
As a point of order , the Brussels Minister of the Labour and Transport Service launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project of re@@ pain@@ ting 16 po@@ les of traffic lights in the region to the y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ours of Brussels .
The aim is both &apos; to increase security &apos; and &apos; Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long term , to pain@@ t all the traffic lights in Brussels at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
However , the blue chosen by the Minister is &apos; too much &apos; , according to the Brussels Member of Brussels , Em@@ manu@@ el De Bo@@ c@@ k , who talks about &apos; Flem@@ ish &apos; in the capital and demands the &apos; resignation &apos; of Bri@@ gi@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els .
&apos;@@ No content to spend the money of Brussels &apos; money on a t@@ ack of po@@ te@@ -@@ po@@ oling po@@ les in the Brussels region , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els continues to carry out the fire of the Capital of Capital &apos; .
After his j@@ ail@@ ing tax@@ is , she has finally re@@ pain@@ ted the po@@ les in Brussels .
According to the honourable Member , there is now no &apos; no longer a difference of visual continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels &apos; .
Brussels deserves better than to see their money squ@@ an@@ dered by a C@@ D &amp; V minister who is itself carrying out the N@@ V@@ A programme .
It is high time to stop F@@ landers .
&apos;@@ A point of order , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els was elected only with 2 2@@ 45 votes to 0.5 % of Brussels &apos; .

L@@ ess@@ ons of an acc@@ ess@@ ory to Google G@@ l@@ ass
A online shop , offering a multi@@ tu@@ de of acc@@ ess@@ ories to Google G@@ l@@ ass , has just been made available to thousands of develop@@ ers with a proto@@ type of the connected gl@@ asses signed Google .
They can thus acquire an wi@@ el@@ der , a char@@ ger or even an old one .
This slu@@ dge , which is strictly reserved for develop@@ ers already with G@@ l@@ ass G@@ l@@ ass , proposes a few by-@@ products such as a char@@ ger and c@@ able U@@ S@@ B , for $ 50 .
For the same price , it is also possible to acquire a wave of protection made in micro-@@ fi@@ b@@ res or an in@@ tra@@ ri@@ ar wi@@ der .
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google G@@ l@@ ass , f@@ itted with correction ver@@ ses , no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed .
Five years ago , my father lost out from the world of living .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking about him now , and I was talking about him .
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to &apos; attend &apos; .
There is no recipe , no way of employment to cross the wall of in@@ visible and to find its own .
Then there were signs .
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving .
Another time , a double aw@@ ak@@ ening in the middle of the night to look at his shows that no longer leaves me at night .
It is the image of my s@@ ister father who ac@@ companies me in my daily gest@@ ures .
Our mother left us after his exha@@ u@@ sting fight against cancer .
This is at least what I thought of the day when I found its empty body , cr@@ ying on this hospital bed to b@@ red flags .
Similarly , its fun@@ eral was a gl@@ aci@@ al f@@ are@@ well focused around the meag@@ re lu@@ gg@@ age of the tanks .
I thought it was a part .
S@@ hor@@ tly , by little ballot bo@@ xes or no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal events , a little ti@@ mid , a bit er@@ ron@@ eous , she quickly returned to my mind , changing as she took her place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in m@@ our@@ ning .
And then it turned out to be very close to my own fac@@ ets that I had not yet seen , disgu@@ sted by my relationship .
I have therefore learned and understood that I have not lost the person of my mother , but simply a woman that I was not really familiar with , a woman who embo@@ died that person during his life in life .
In dying , this woman had a perfect life and released the person I love , and now I was there , full and full .
This is the most unexpected and beautiful way of life .
It is a privilege to know that the loved people never leave .
I look to my father , &apos; both inside and outside &apos; .
I have always been told .
I never believed it at that time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , ill .
I was not afraid of him , and I was able to love him .
One day he died .
He went to me for a long time : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I had a bad ...
He spoke to me and was constantly encouraged , he was living my body .
I saw his hands looking at mine , I was a body .
But that was never the case .
I was able to have a personal life .
He left me in@@ tim@@ ate .
It lasted for a long time and one day .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged and advised .
I no longer know who said that people who died are not forgotten but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer , but I feel them constantly .
Every event , every moment in my life , makes me feel their presence because I am always referring to it : what have they said ?
I constantly dream of them , perhaps not all ni@@ ghts but several times a week .
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this .
I am often an@@ gu@@ ish when it comes to me and I deeply feel their absence .
Sometimes , some dreams are on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed they continue to live and share my life .
On the eve of my ma@@ xi@@ m in which I had to know the sex of my baby , I dre@@ am@@ ed that I would wake up , I was out of the bed , my father was waiting for me on her pat@@ ch@@ work , and I was very pleased that I was waiting for a little bo@@ y .
The next day , I had the feeling that he visited me in my sle@@ ep to tell me that he was happy to share what happened .
And of course , it was a small bo@@ y in my sel@@ ler .
I wanted to share this moment with him , and I am pleased to say that common memory lived after his death .
Five years ago , my grand@@ mother died as a result of cancer .
A year ago , she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
That is the shock that his dem@@ ise caused in the young b@@ reath that I was at the time .
However , I have achieved my m@@ our@@ ning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , especially at times when I find myself in difficulty , or when I have to take important decisions .
A@@ vo@@ i@@ ding the Arab@@ ic and taking an interest in the Middle East , to the point of making it a m@@ ate in a great school , has not , with hin@@ d@@ sight , been in any way an@@ od@@ ine choices .
In fact , I often heard him speak Arab@@ ic in my childhood , and talk about Morocco , where it had lived for decades , before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values she has charged to me are still present , so I think I think how she would like me to act at some point .
The same goes for my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and the righ@@ te@@ ousness of the spirit that was a fer@@ vent beli@@ ever .
Now I feel it is a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent soul , a sal@@ v@@ age spirit .
I see his views on me .
My mother died 19 years ago .
Mor@@ te has spoken to me on the telephone .
I have gone through all the phases : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , pain , the cr@@ acks that are going on alone , anywhere , anywhere , in in@@ sol@@ vent places , are in@@ con@@ gr@@ uous times .
Then the time has appe@@ ased .
It was only the lack , this un@@ answered vacuum , that need and the need for me , to reassure me that it is soft .
Yet it is there , there is a silent presence , it is there and I am looking at it .
All the morning , I see his concern about me , I see the r@@ ings that are weigh@@ ing up his eyes , the r@@ allies around the li@@ ps that cigarettes are growing , the cr@@ acks that mark the day of concern .
My mother took up my face and she looked at me every morning in my mir@@ ror .
And every morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer to 43 years .
There is a constant sense of protection , and nothing serious can happen .
It was his promise on his pain bed , then you were gradually re@@ learned to s@@ mile , and to say his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I am talking to him at night when the absence is doing too badly , she inv@@ ites me in my dreams when mor@@ ale is a little .
We feel that we are being protected and protected in difficult times , and the time has come for us to see how it was the head of or@@ che@@ str@@ a and we are trying to stay on the path it has outlined .
If one was very much like you , the absence could not gr@@ u@@ b you from heart and memories .
In a way , it is to be hoped for your internal energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I have always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated .
I was not able to attend his in@@ hum@@ ation and three weeks after his death , I was given a little bo@@ y .
If I have my personal convictions , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision .
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , I am not going to do so and I still wonder what will happen .
I do not know whether I have adopted its way or whether I am simply like it : is it genetic ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a alter@@ -@@ e@@ go , there was no need to talk between us .
In short , it is on a daily basis .
I feel his presence and I am pleased about that .
It is almost thirty years since my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I had 28 years and our son 6 years .
The huge penalty that then inv@@ aded me was , of course , mitig@@ ated , but it is still close to me .
Very often he &apos; lan@@ es &apos; in my dreams in such a precise , so vi@@ vi@@ d way that I am even more sad to see that this was only a dream .
On the other night , he asked me whether I was going to go well , I told him no , he said &apos; I des@@ c@@ end &apos; , but with such a real voice that I wo@@ ke up , an@@ gu@@ ish , and fed the ch@@ or@@ us of hor@@ ses by watching everywhere , convinced that it was going to happen .
I always live in the same house , and often I feel that I have been watching to see if he is not here , I know he is he and I am talking to him .
In all the pieces I feel his presence and I am pleased to see that .
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and the spirit lives with me .
I have been 58 years old , I have always lived alone from his departure , he is and will remain love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am soci@@ alized with a profession of responsibility , I am , I am a grand@@ mother , I am a grand@@ mother , I am full of friends , but my heart and soul belong to him and I never speak with him except with my son , and I am never going to c@@ eme@@ tery .
Iraq : October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008 .
Baghdad published official figures this Friday : 9@@ 64 people died last month : 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers .
This publication takes place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants help from the United States .
&apos;@@ We do not say to the world that we are on our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , said al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki this Thursday in Washington .
And also because , if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved , it will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also expand .
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives ?
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
O@@ ut@@ side the building , demonstrators were protesting against the Iraqi leader .
They were bran@@ ding the blame for being a murde@@ rer and calling on the US to refuse to provide aid .
The co@@ c@@ ain@@ e lawyer who has informed a drug par@@ k of a police investigation has been imprisoned .
B@@ ast@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to the N@@ ei@@ l S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was revealed to the great day .
He was sentenced to a prison sentence of three years by the Court of Li@@ ver@@ pool in Li@@ ver@@ pool
A great defence lawyer , who had informed a drug par@@ k of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
B@@ ast@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years ago , gave sensitive information to the N@@ ei@@ l S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh Ar@@ ch@@ l@@ ord on investigations into his dru@@ g@@ -related activities after being compromised because of his habit of using co@@ c@@ ain@@ e .
The lawyer , who was named &apos; B@@ ast@@ h &apos; and considered by criminals as an &apos; important dossier &apos; , was arrested at home in 2011 as a result of police listening operations to S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , which he represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials have returned to Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 years , in the process of tabling three bag@@ s of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e at the home of the lawyer in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , when he was at a din@@ ner din@@ ner with colleagues .
Sur@@ ve@@ ys have revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a &apos; regular consumer &apos; of this cl@@ ass@@ -@@ class drugs , after tests showed co@@ c@@ ain@@ e trac@@ es in their ha@@ ir , portfolio and credit cards .
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough and one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into the trafficking of hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in the coun@@ ties of Lan@@ c@@ sh@@ ire , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ si@@ de , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
Together with 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for an amount of 1.5 M , as well as more than GBP 200 000 in a series of ra@@ ids .
T@@ ut@@ ta , 42 years ago , provided information to the criminals because it was feared that its drug dependence would be revealed .
Today , at the Court of Li@@ ver@@ pool , Di@@ t@@ ta , which is working in the cabinet of For@@ bes Solidarity in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , has fallen into dis@@ quiet after having been convicted of two charges of charges against justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He had admitted the possession of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e during a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he had been in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators have followed the suspect and returned to the home of Di@@ t@@ ta and placing drugs , which is no more than 60 % , under the b@@ ann@@ er of the lawyer in a black gol@@ f .
S@@ hor@@ tly after the deposit , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta , who was at a din@@ ner at the E@@ wood Par@@ k football stad@@ ium , pregnant in the B@@ lin@@ k@@ bur@@ n Ro@@ to club .
The lawyer is back home , he has discovered drugs and they have been using nine times .
The court has heard that Di@@ t@@ ta was a &apos; regular consumer &apos; of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests showed trac@@ es of this cl@@ ass@@ -@@ class drugs in his ha@@ ir , portfolio and credit cards .
T@@ ut@@ ta was arrested later , but denied the use of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e ; he said he had spoken about alleged trafficking in drugs because he was his cli@@ ent and said that their discussions were subject to a &apos; legal privilege &apos; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw a number of credit cards , but they were all seized and they were taken from a ha@@ ir s@@ ample .
At a inter@@ rog@@ ation he said he had an office at his home , as well as at his workplace , and that he would get customers to call him for legal matters .
But the court has heard testi@@ monies that he called major players in the drugs trade , some of whom he represented , after key arrests to tell them which investig@@ ators knew .
The Chief Prosecutor An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : &apos; If anyone should know that you should not violate the law , it is a criminal lawyer &apos; .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal lawyer , and of having been too involved in particular customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking , but a drug trafficking that provides drugs to its own lawyer .
Some of its communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer .
But it went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
He has obstruc@@ ted the police investigation as much as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not honour his profession , but he was dis@@ honoured .
It has been too close to some customers , especially S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and has allowed its independence to be compromised .
Di@@ t@@ ta denied any illegal anno@@ y@@ ance and said : &apos; If I were a corrupt lawyer , I am not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not have waited for 15 hours , I would have done so immediately . &apos;
However , after the hearing , the super@@ vised Le@@ e H@@ al@@ ste@@ ad de the La@@ h@@ sh@@ ire Police said : &apos; Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has gone from a criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started to obtain drugs from criminal organisations &apos; .
His addiction to co@@ c@@ ain@@ e has been a compromise for ever and has made it vulnerable to the ul@@ ter@@ ior motives of the leaders of organised criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining valuable information about police investigations .
L@@ aw@@ yers should observe the highest integrity rules and create a climate of confidence in the public .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has betra@@ yed this confidence and tried to hide behind the virtu@@ es of his profession .
The serious and organised crime unit in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re carried out the investigation into Mr Di@@ t@@ ta , who was convicted of the three charges of charge of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and now obstruc@@ ting justice , demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminal criminals .
It should be a warning to criminals that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was himself imprisoned for 14 years after he was guilty of complicity in the complicity of hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five others involved in traffic have been sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years in prison for drugs trafficking .
On his site , Di@@ t@@ ta organized a sitting of questions and answers on himself in which he said that his dream of dream would be to be a lawyer to represent customers in the death row in America , his last gu@@ est to din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali and inequality would be what would motiv@@ ate him to work .
A@@ re@@ th@@ a Frank@@ lin will be on the scene in December
The De@@ tro@@ it Ne@@ ws newspaper reports that the Qu@@ een Qu@@ een will take place on 21 December in the Red Bo@@ ard room of the ho@@ tel Mo@@ tor@@ nit@@ y Cas@@ ino .
Mrs Frank@@ lin is dealing in November with the registration of an al@@ bu@@ m for C@@ li@@ ve D@@ av@@ is and S@@ ony Mu@@ sic , produced by D@@ on W@@ as and Ken@@ ne@@ dy &apos; B@@ ab@@ y@@ se &apos; .
Without specifying the disease it suffered , the famous interpre@@ ter of Res@@ pec@@ ts told the media on 16 October that the side effects of treatment that it received were &apos; difficult &apos; .
She says she is &apos; happy to return &apos; .

L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es airport
A sho@@ ot@@ ings took place at the international airport in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es .
It was 10 a.m. in the morning when a man opened fire .
According to the local police , there are at least 2 injured .
It would be an employee working for the US Transport Safety Administration ( T@@ SA ) and the perpetr@@ ator .
The incident would have occurred at ter@@ minal 3 , causing a wave of panic .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers and staff have been rush@@ ed down or on the sli@@ p .
Very quickly police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the draw@@ er was seized on the ro@@ of of an airport par@@ king .
The airport is being evac@@ uated and air traffic is being interrupted .
C@@ l@@ assi@@ fication for teen@@ ag@@ ers
Each time it is the school customer that will be targeted , an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season .
Through five S@@ ay@@ n@@ tes imagined and interpreted by artists in the region , stic@@ ks with a high do@@ se of hum@@ our , we are allowing teen@@ ag@@ ers to be able to learn the classi@@ cal old .
In addition to this spectac@@ le , the Kingdom &apos;s ly@@ ric@@ al art Society will return with its ly@@ ric@@ al D@@ es@@ nations , a formula that is now filled with the P@@ ul@@ per@@ y in Chi@@ k@@ sti@@ m@@ i .
Two further concer@@ ts will take place in summer 2014 , giving artists in the region a chance to show what they are capable of .
In these activities , the ly@@ ric@@ al Ap@@ pendi@@ x , which was held last August , was added , with the help of the col@@ or@@ i@@ ature col@@ or@@ i@@ ature Mari@@ e-@@ E@@ ve M@@ un@@ er .
It was an acti@@ vit@@ y-@@ benefit , along with the artistic dimension , and it helped the no@@ t-@@ for-@@ profit body to produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft on ears as an air in the m@@ ouse .
Without giving precise figures , the President of the Board of Direc@@ tors , Y@@ ves Ber@@ ger@@ on , took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday , in Chi@@ k@@ sti@@ m@@ i , to be reassuring .
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions , the future is developing well , even in the long term .
We have more solid and constant support .
&apos;@@ Finance is af@@ lo@@ at and we hope to continue until the 50@@ th anniversary of the oper@@ a , a step we will take in seven years &apos; , has started the adminis@@ tr@@ ator .
&apos;@@ I would even go beyond &apos; , added the Director-General , H@@ Ã©@@ l@@ Ã¨@@ ne G@@ au@@ d@@ ul@@ t , by s@@ mil@@ ing .
The 3@@ 7-@@ year-old man who took a child hostage at the G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el@@ le Ro@@ y Scho@@ ol of Sur@@ rey is facing six charges , according to the Ro@@ yal G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie of Canada .
Om@@ ar M@@ ou@@ st@@ he@@ a H@@ ass@@ an has been accused of taking hostage , se@@ aling , threatening threats , port of weapon in a dangerous , kidn@@ ap@@ ping , and failing to comply with an order .
&apos;@@ The rapid reaction of the polic@@ emen involved and their ability to def@@ use the situation immediately were essential to the security conclusion of this incident &apos; , declared the Corpor@@ al Ber@@ t P@@ qu@@ et by way of communi@@ qu@@ Ã© .

New demand for collective redress against the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ ir@@ s
A new request for collective redress has been lod@@ ged against the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ ir@@ t bro@@ thers , with regard to sexual assa@@ ults that took place this time in the St Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ atory and in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the testi@@ mony of the shar@@ k , identified as &apos; J@@ . I &apos; , who would have been mas@@ qu@@ er@@ aded in the 195@@ 0s , first of all in N@@ ine@@ e-@@ des@@ -@@ Ne@@ il@@ ges by his prof@@ essor , the S@@ ay@@ ed bro@@ ther , and then by his colleague , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , at the St Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ atory , where he was used as a mass and where his father worked as a pain@@ ter .
The first resort was only three institutions , and when the regulation was announced , many people told us : &apos; I was in that place , I can register &apos; , says the lawyer Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ult , who defends the victims in both cases .
The collective redress that has just been tabled is a special one to allow complain@@ ants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been carried out by members of the Ho@@ ly C@@ ro@@ t .
At the moment , the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ cross bro@@ thers .
The alleged facts are usually older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the institutions that were targeted were closed in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also emphasises that the establishment of the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ ro@@ t and the Ho@@ ly Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ atory , which is a separate entity , &apos; allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &apos; , that they &apos; had a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &apos; , that they were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless stif@@ led them &apos; , and that they have consci@@ ously and consci@@ ously chosen to ignore the issue .
The latest accusations are based , among other things , on letters drawn up by the lawyer of the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ r@@ he@@ a bro@@ thers , M@@ e E@@ mi@@ l Per@@ dri@@ in , in the 1990s , but also by the research into the archi@@ ves on this subject by the bro@@ ther Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy , a former bro@@ ther of Sain@@ t C@@ ro@@ t who publicly denounced the abuse .
Col@@ lec@@ tive redress must first pass the stage of ad@@ mis@@ sibility in the upper court .
Once the Court &apos;s ad@@ mis@@ sibility is accepted , the second stage is to be taken , or the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first resort , the consul@@ tancy of the Ho@@ ly C@@ cross agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ ably before hearings were held on the substance .
A fire in trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the r@@ oun@@ der of La@@ Sal@@ le , in Mon@@ tre@@ al , on Thursday at Friday .
The aid was called to 1@@ th , Friday , because of a fire that had declared itself to be the sub@@ soil of an Indian k@@ it@@ ch@@ en restaur@@ ant on the D@@ ol@@ ard aven@@ ue , near the inter@@ section with the street .
The 30 fire bri@@ g@@ ades that were sent on the scene took almost an hour to control it .
The fire &apos; caused major damage to the structure of the building &apos; has indicated the head of the Mon@@ tre@@ al fire safety service , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in the restaur@@ ant when the fire bri@@ g@@ ades arrived .
There was no w@@ ounded , but almost 20 houses , located in the first and second parts of this side of commercial premises , had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross has been requested , because the residents of one flat@@ s may have to be temporarily temporary , referred to the S@@ EM .
Many opposition to medical aid to die in Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care
The Canadian Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
This is an opportunity for several pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to appe@@ ase their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would like to end their days , according to a spokesman for the Canadian Association of P@@ pal@@ lia@@ tives , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ open .
If we focus on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the approach of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia would become minimal .
The President of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c P@@ ack@@ age also rejects the draft law on medical aid .
If it is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ Ã©@@ ry is worried about the consequences for the next generations .
&apos;@@ What is the meaning of life &apos; ?
The majority of pal@@ lia@@ tive care homes will refuse to help patients die , according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of P@@ pal@@ lia@@ tives , Su@@ z@@ an@@ ine F@@ it@@ z@@ back .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ back , who is also the director of the house Ma@@ thi@@ e@@ -@@ Franc@@ is in G@@ ati@@ water , believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway .
We never ask : &apos; I want to die , give me an injec@@ tion &apos; .
The Director of the United Nations P@@ lan@@ ning Association , R@@ ick Fa@@ ith , believes that the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c bill is dis@@ orien@@ t@@ ating the population about the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He does not believe that the On@@ tari@@ o will follow .
For its part , the liberal Member of G@@ ati@@ n@@ water , St@@ te@@ ph@@ ania V@@ all@@ Ã©s , says that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press
&apos;@@ It is a frigh@@ tening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question : what will prevent Parliament from wi@@ ping out the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? &apos; , said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and demanding that it be declared un@@ constitutional .
&apos;@@ This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and very p@@ uni@@ tive , and we reject it &apos; , explained C@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ u , Director-General of Capital Group - the owner of Cap@@ it@@ tal@@ F@@ M , one of the most respected independent radio stations and websites in Kenya .
He pointed out that the new media court will always be one-sided because it is an extension of the government , and restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&apos;@@ I hope that the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the Members &apos; , he added .
According to the newspaper The Sta@@ r , the new draft law will allow the government to &apos; hold on the media &apos; . The Stand@@ ard has , on the other hand , indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &apos; had suffered a hard blow &apos; and roc@@ ked the bill as &apos; d@@ rac@@ onian &apos; .
The adoption of the draft law comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the commercial centre of West@@ g@@ ate last September .
The Ken@@ yan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by dissem@@ inating pictures of vide@@ o-@@ cam@@ er@@ as on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack are allegedly rob@@ bing the luxury centre .
The head of the police , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o , responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them , even though the call was withdrawn as a result of the lifting of c@@ lic@@ h@@ ers in the media .
Under the new draft law , the media may be pun@@ ishable by fines of up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &apos; radi@@ ated &apos; or no longer being able to receive official press acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the goods of a offenders if it has not paid a fine .
According to the D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , &apos; even one fine is enough to paraly@@ se most F@@ M stations &apos; .
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the &apos; lively blo@@ go@@ sphere &apos; in Kenya .
By reducing the media , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
&apos;@@ Nobody will never know &apos; , wrote Mu@@ tu@@ ma Ma@@ thi@@ u , a journalist in The N@@ ation , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of control in public life .
&apos;@@ Li@@ ving for themselves , politicians would put the country into bankruptcy and would bring us back to hunting and co@@ oling &apos; .
Ken@@ yan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the national wage committee and rein@@ stated their mi@@ gh@@ ty wages of around 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month tax@@ -free , which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmac@@ ists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmac@@ ists at the Health and Social Services Centre ( S@@ S@@ S ) from L@@ av@@ al caused a whole host to the leadership of the C@@ Health Ho@@ sp@@ ital in the year 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
As a result of multiple retirement , maternity leave or depar@@ tures , the P@@ harm@@ ac@@ ist department has found itself seriously defici@@ ent .
There was almost 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , according to the head of the department , G@@ illi@@ an Be@@ au@@ d@@ and .
However , the S@@ S@@ S has decided not to engage in an independent workforce , which can cost up to three times more than a full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist .
There was no use of the breakdown , Mrs Be@@ au@@ d@@ et explained .
Some of our activities have been stream@@ lined or reduced within the establishment of the pat@@ ch@@ work , the time that things are getting back .
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people &#91; residents in pharm@@ acies &#93; to come and stay here .
There is a combination of circumstances that have led to a bad situation last year .
Im@@ proved improvement
After this difficult period , the year 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 is much easier for the S@@ S@@ S P@@ ack@@ age department .
Already , three pharmac@@ ists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmac@@ ists have been recru@@ ited in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to hold back have borne fruit , because the four pupils who are under house arrest in L@@ av@@ al have also decided to remain in the S@@ S@@ S .
Now it is much better , has highlighted the pharmac@@ ist .
By the end of the financial year we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity returns .
This will therefore fill our depar@@ tures from last year .
L@@ ess ever ?
However , the situation remains delicate .
Several factors , such as the shortage of pharmac@@ ists in hospital or the predomin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because there is a young environment , and many young women are employed , therefore with pregnan@@ cies , almost always three maternity leave , when it goes well , has added .
In the last year we have had much more and there is no pharmac@@ ists who are available to make replace , so it was more difficult .
The to@@ p mo@@ p of 22 years does not start his career in the cinema by the back door .
The director L@@ ars von T@@ ry chose to emb@@ ody Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg young in N@@ y@@ mp@@ hom@@ i@@ a@@ c , his next film .

The resemb@@ l@@ ance of Sta@@ c@@ y Martin with his el@@ ic@@ it is striking : a b@@ len@@ te of b@@ len@@ der , a di@@ version and the Franco-@@ British origins .
Without forgetting the risk of a certain risk : the one that had not hesit@@ ated to s@@ ne@@ ak on g@@ los@@ sy paper is going to be seen in much more sulph@@ ur@@ ous situations .
A N@@ y@@ m@@ hom@@ i@@ a@@ c extra@@ d@@ ite has raised the temperature on the To@@ l : Sta@@ c@@ y Martin appears to be in the bed and in full exc@@ itement with Shi@@ a La@@ Be@@ ou@@ f .
If the provoc@@ ative fil@@ ter has asked its actors to put their pun@@ ish@@ ments on the shel@@ f , it has resor@@ ted to professionals from X to the most o@@ dious scenes , before mer@@ ging all the num@@ er@@ ical bodies : above the bel@@ t , it is the star ; below , the d@@ wind@@ ling .
From B@@ j@@ Ã¶r@@ k to Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg , to Nic@@ o@@ le K@@ id@@ man , L@@ ars von T@@ ri@@ er is used to pushing his cr@@ ack@@ ers into their last tran@@ ches , always for the best .

A C@@ G@@ R room in N@@ ar@@ right
On Thursday evening , the first sitting of a film was suspended in the M@@ ei@@ a C@@ GN@@ R of N@@ ar@@ bon , with a precautionary measure , as a result of p@@ aper@@ work of the spec@@ t@@ ators .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , the Director of the establishment has done the evac@@ uation of the Chamber and warned the fire bri@@ g@@ ade for a suspect sm@@ ell .
Some 70 people have come out of the sitting .
People have been examined and there has been a complete recognition of the room .
M@@ ight I jo@@ ke at the bottom of the te@@ ar j@@ et ?

It attempts to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into ic@@ ks
Taking advantage of the H@@ al@@ we@@ en Day , a woman tried to get two k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in the country , on Thursday morning , at the Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ present airport .
It is when we look at the bag@@ s that drugs have been detected .
The co@@ c@@ ain@@ e had been distributed in three c@@ ic@@ ks which had previously been transferred .
Drugs were then transported to the Office of the Ro@@ yal G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie of Canada ( G@@ R@@ C ) which took over in this investigation .
Canada &apos;s border services agency ( SA@@ F@@ C ) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
This was part of the investigation , which indicated that J@@ acqu@@ e@@ in Rob@@ ly was spokesman for the SA@@ F@@ C .
What I can tell you is that it came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border services at the Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ present airport have carried out 17@@ 3 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 co@@ c@@ ain@@ e se@@ iz@@ ures for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , the border service officers in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region made a total of 16@@ 53 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs .
Air in Syria
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A short of SA@@ -@@ 8 cargo cargo would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new ra@@ id of the T@@ Sa@@ h@@ al aviation in Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz ) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor by Syria .
The ra@@ id took place in almost identical circumstances to the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an an@@ onymous American official who confirmed in C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack , which was , this time , aimed at the Y@@ ak@@ h@@ a solar missiles delivered by Russia in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Israeli officials had not conce@@ aled their irrit@@ ation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine
The rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ or@@ se low@@ ered the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of Ukraine on Friday , questioning the capacity of the former Soviet re@@ public , in recession for more than a year , to face up to its financial obligations .
The note of the country &apos;s public debt ti@@ t@@ les goes to &apos; B@@ - &apos; , which is sin@@ king into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative perspective , and S &amp; P sees at least one chance in three that it will be reduced again within a year .
&apos;@@ It is less and less likely that the government &apos;s strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs &apos; , explains the US agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine &apos;s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 and predic@@ ts that the trend will continue .
This complic@@ ates the re@@ payment of credit from abroad .
These reserves , to which the authorities have a massive recourse to support the local currency , h@@ ry@@ v@@ nia , collap@@ sing , the agency is increasingly likely to be devaluation , which would increase its external debt .
Ki@@ ev also needs liquidity to settle gas imports to Russia , which accuse it of not paying a bill of USD 8@@ 82 million .
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of deep tension with its Russian neighbour , fu@@ rious about Ki@@ ev &apos;s desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy suffered from July and September its fifth quarter of contr@@ action .
Its debt , which is still relatively modest , has explo@@ ded in recent years and S &amp; D estimated at 3.5 % of GDP , compared with less than 10 % before the 2008-@@ 2009 crisis .
The country , in the budget deficit , has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months , which had given it a USD 15@@ .@@ 3 billion credit in 2010 and has only released EUR 3.@@ 4 billion .
However , the fund refuses to pay any new tran@@ che until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , particularly by increasing gas prices to the population .
After a new unsuccessful mission in the country , the IMF noted this week that &apos; significant external financing needs &apos; were &apos; a vulnerability &apos; , while being &apos; signs of economic improvement &apos; .
However , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r J@@ ol@@ oud , the Centre for Political Stu@@ dies , &apos; you cannot wait for short-term improvement &apos; .
&apos;@@ There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-@@ election year &apos; , the presidential elections being planned in 2015 , the expert , questioned to the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
In addition , it is the &apos; uncertainty &apos; that is linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU that Brussels is dependent on the release of the opposition Yu@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
&apos;@@ Sign@@ ing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long term , but there could be negative negative consequences in the short and medium term linked to Russia &apos;s response &apos; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &apos; trade restrictions &apos; from Moscow .
Russia , which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports , has warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Ki@@ ev , it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods .
US Green Paper on the P@@ u@@ lic@@ c@@ is@@ -@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m merger
P@@ u@@ li@@ ci@@ is and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m said on Friday that there was no objection from the US authorities to their merger , moving closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency .
The merger brings the second global agency , O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , and the third , P@@ u@@ li@@ ci@@ is .
&apos;@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m Group and P@@ u@@ li@@ ci@@ as have announced today the expiry of the deadline for examining the previously announced merger of P@@ u@@ li@@ ci@@ as Group and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , provided for by the Har@@ t S@@ co@@ t@@ t-@@ Ro@@ d@@ ino An@@ tic@@ u@@ t Act of 197@@ 6 , as amended &apos; .
They state that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the S@@ S@@ R review period in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other juris@@ dic@@ tions meet several of the conditions for the realisation of the operation .
&apos;@@ Fu@@ sion is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and approval of the shareholders of both groups &apos; .
Congolese army is continuing the M@@ 23 rebels
The Congolese army ( F@@ ARC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hun@@ t out the M@@ 23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u in Rwanda and Uganda .
M@@ 23 appears to be on the ver@@ ge of being beaten after being driven out of the towns from the north-@@ east of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) that it has controlled from the beginning 20 months ago from the insur@@ gency .
&apos;@@ We shall continue with M@@ 23 and make it all the way it is , because it is criminals &apos; , declared to Re@@ u@@ ters the Col@@ on@@ el O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokesman for the F@@ ARC .
We must not allow them to be re@@ organised because they have been mar@@ ty@@ r@@ ating the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace .
M@@ 23 officials have explained that they have evac@@ uated the loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure and Ber@@ tr@@ d B@@ is@@ sim@@ wa , who is responsible for the re@@ bel@@ lion , said on the F@@ FI that these military set@@ backs would not change his demands for peace talks .
The latter , according to the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , took on Wednesday in K@@ amp@@ ala between the government of Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 .
C@@ ho@@ gg@@ ling is reported in the h@@ ills that domin@@ ate B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the last loc@@ ality in the hands of the insur@@ gents to fall this week , as well as around R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a h@@ ill in which the M@@ 23 re@@ bel@@ lion came into being in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , the ma@@ ster@@ y of the North Ki@@ v@@ u province , taking advantage of the flight from the government gar@@ den and the p@@ assi@@ vity of the Mon@@ us@@ co blue c@@ ats .
The fall of G@@ om@@ a led the United Nations Mission in the DR@@ C , the largest in the world in terms of staffing , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid bri@@ g@@ ade of intervention made up of South African , Mal@@ aw@@ i and tanks .
For its part , the staff of the F@@ ARC have been reformed and the army has gone to the offensive against M@@ 23 , which is changing the course of war .
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;@@ M@@ 23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predic@@ ting an expert on Congolese affairs , J@@ son Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Si@@ as@@ a .
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa managed to fight a major insur@@ gency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DR@@ C .
United Nations experts are accused of Rwanda , which den@@ ies it fier@@ cely , to support the M@@ 23 milit@@ arily , formed from the former Congolese soldiers muti@@ l@@ ated .
The head of British diplomacy , Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , invited the Rw@@ and@@ an President Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to show restraint , announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office .
Last week , K@@ ig@@ ali spoke of the possibility of military re@@ pris@@ als following the sh@@ ell@@ s in Rw@@ and@@ an territory .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana inv@@ aded the streets of the execu@@ ting to welcome the entry of the F@@ ARC soldiers .
&apos;@@ We have lived a year with M@@ 23 , and it seemed un@@ imagin@@ able to us to be released by the army &apos; , testi@@ fies to an inhabit@@ ant of the neighbouring region of Uganda .
&apos;@@ We have lived in terror ( M@@ 23 ) , we are tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tised &apos; , added that man .
The tests carried out by the P@@ ast@@ er Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by cor@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ us have proved negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &apos; the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two confirmed cases in France to date &apos; .
Tuesday , this 4@@ 4@@ -year patient had been suspected of being reached , after returning from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed 50 deaths .
The second American oil company , Ch@@ ev@@ ron , reported on Friday of a reduction in its quar@@ terly benefit because of the fall in its refin@@ ing margins , while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining out of proportion with the group &apos;s objectives .
Its net benefit from the third quarter fell to USD 4.@@ 95 billion , or $ 2.@@ 57 per action , compared with USD 5.@@ 25 billion , or USD 2.@@ 69 per action , a year ago .
The analy@@ sts questioned by Re@@ u@@ ters were on average on a profit from USD 2.@@ 71 .
The group produced 2.@@ 59 million bar@@ rel@@ s of pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um equivalent per day in the course of the quarter , increasing compared with the 2.@@ 52 million b@@ p@@ j produced a year ago .
The company is about 2.@@ 65 million in this year , with a 25 % growth in production expected by 201@@ 7 .
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas projects in Australia .
Due to the cost of these projects , annual investment spending increased by USD 7 billion in two years and is expected to reach USD 3@@ 6.@@ 7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities have fallen slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of down@@ stream activities ( including refin@@ ing and chemical production ) have fallen from 45 % to USD 3@@ 80 million .
This reduction in refin@@ ing margins affects the whole sector .
For example , the main competi@@ tor of Ch@@ ev@@ ron , Ex@@ xon Mob@@ il , reported on Thursday a net net benefit , despite the increase in its gas and oil production .
Trans@@ f@@ er transport : the complaint deemed admissible
The school committee of the S@@ her@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( S@@ CA@@ R@@ S ) has been demanding from the start of the school year the costs of USD 150 per pup@@ il ( up to $ 300 per family ) for pupils benefiting from two homes , a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so .
Before the changes in the last budget , no financial contribution was requested .
&apos;@@ There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested &apos; , Mrs L@@ ef@@ at explains this .
In its opinion , the S@@ CA@@ R@@ S has been invited to mediation and has asked for further time to reflect on this .
&apos;@@ It is always better to talk about it , concer@@ t and find solutions &apos; , Mrs L@@ ef@@ at says .
The school committee of the S@@ her@@ bro@@ o@@ ke region ( CS@@ R@@ S ) did not want to comment .
The organisation only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint .
I@@ mp@@ act on the closure of H@@ om@@ el@@ -@@ God emergencies
In view of the fact that some of the staff and several trade unions , including the C@@ G@@ T , the Minister for Health , Mar@@ is@@ ol T@@ our@@ an , have been working on the subject for several months , 10 July had decided to &apos; delay the timetable for implementation of the project , and in particular the date for the closure of emergencies which will not be able to take place on 4 November &apos; .
An official request made &apos; so that we do not run any risk at the beginning of the winter of the winter of the winter &apos; but also intended not to hinder the S@@ PS campaign in a few months &apos; time .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should still be effective on that date .
Even if , in the A@@ P@@ P , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As of 4 November , the fire bri@@ g@@ ades , which claimed about a quarter of the 40 000 annual pass@@ ages in the H@@ em@@ el@@ el@@ -@@ God emergencies , will have all received a sign of taking the thirty serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of inter@@ vals .
In the H@@ em@@ el@@ el@@ -@@ God , the internal ur@@ gencies will leave five internal medicine on Monday .
As for the transfer of the le@@ ds of internal medicine , it is scheduled for this month .
&apos;@@ The H@@ om@@ el@@ -@@ God P@@ lan@@ ning Service must close in the shor@@ test possible time , and for us , it is 4 November &apos; , and it is no longer a case of L@@ o City , the chairman of the A@@ P@@ P &apos;s Committee on Development , which supports the project .
&apos;@@ On 4 November , there will be no more patient patients , only people coming from their own means &apos; confirms Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical leader of the new Ho@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God .
&apos;@@ But we will continue to welcome emergency patients &apos; , he has said that there is a permanent presence of S@@ M@@ U@@ R vehicles there to transfer serious cases .
Sen@@ ior senior doctors will remain on the ground , but he is also doing so .
But it is up to the AR@@ S to decide on the closure of the emergency service .
&apos;@@ Things are gradually being done &apos; , responding to Nicol@@ as PÃ©@@ j@@ u , the spokesman for the AR@@ S for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in service . &apos;
&apos;@@ The minister li@@ ed to us or he was li@@ ed &apos; , deplo@@ ying the Chief Prosecutor , G@@ Ã©r@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ k .
As a leader of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R leader at the beginning of July , for leading the front against the re@@ organization project , it is defined as an &apos; alert &apos; to a &apos; cynical &apos; decision taken by &apos; the medi@@ o@@ administrative techno@@ structure &apos; .
&apos;@@ They are in the process of de@@ pressing and suff@@ oc@@ ating emergencies that were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &apos; .
For him , &apos; if other Paris emergencies could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &apos; .
However , they are regularly eng@@ ul@@ fed .
For example , there are sometimes nine hours waiting for the emergencies of L@@ ari@@ bo@@ is@@ er .
In the AR@@ S , it is claimed that thirty &apos; dis@@ pat@@ ched &apos; patients on several sites are not at risk of representing an &apos; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &apos; in other emergency services , whose human resources will also have been strengthened .
In the case of the AR@@ S and the A@@ P@@ P , the &apos; new hospital model &apos; has already been set up since 7 October and should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients a year .
By the end of the year , liberal practi@@ tioners should also be involved in the establishment of &apos; am@@ bul@@ atory care &apos; .
&apos;@@ Where is it if people are asked to self-@@ diagno@@ se &apos; , the question of G@@ Ã©r@@ i@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ k , who &apos; the concept of a serious emergency &apos; is &apos; dangerous &apos; , is a &apos; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &apos; ?
This is going to happen as in the case of maternity hospitals 3 .
People are not mad , they go where there is the best offer of care .
If the Minister does not take action by Monday , we will be changing the po@@ et , pre@@ aching Chris@@ top@@ her P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , a Chief doctor and a member of the Health C@@ G@@ T .
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list .
In the N@@ ath@@ ia K@@ os@@ ci@@ us@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ oriz@@ i team , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , the U@@ M@@ P advis@@ or of Paris and elected from the 4@@ th ar@@ row , clearly announ@@ ces that &apos; even if the Paris M@@ P was for the maintenance of ur@@ gencies in the H@@ em@@ el@@ he@@ -@@ God , it would be technically and financially impossible to re@@ open them if you are responsible &apos; .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the PS candidate , once again reminded us on Monday morning of France that she voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark its net disagreement , highlighting B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , his spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of the Ho@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God has its legitimacy in substance , we cannot accept it without an acceptable system of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama puts an end to the IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to put an end to the listened to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities .
This decision is part of the White House &apos;s attempt to take up its hand in the case of the N@@ SA listening to the re@@ vel@@ ations made by former Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , a refugee in Russia .
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal .
O@@ ut of the matter , a head of the US administration replied : &apos; The United States is not conducting electronic surveillance for the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &apos; .
When speaking under the heading of an@@ onym@@ ity , this official did not specify whether such supervision had been put in place in the past .
Another official has said that Barack Obama has put a stop to these practices in the past weeks .
This in@@ struction was given at some point at the same time as the end of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , the Sen@@ ator Committee on Int@@ elli@@ gence approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but allowed them to continue .
The committee has introduced further restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and impose a five-year limit on the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new objectives for combating poverty
The United Nations will now start working on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( M@@ DGs ) , which had been set up 12 years ago to combat world poverty .
Austr@@ ali@@ an diplomats have played a key role in putting forward the &apos; sustainable development objectives &apos; intended to replace the M@@ DGs , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development , which began on the eve of Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They were in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by the world leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , during the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to &apos; exceed national interests &apos; .
&apos;@@ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development targets ( O@@ D@@ D ) &apos; , he added .
These D@@ D@@ Cs will be based on progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to realise our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the M@@ DGs .
The concern about security in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts are emerging between powerful figures .
At the he@@ ight of the stat@@ ue of Sa@@ am@@ a M@@ ach@@ l , the foun@@ der of Mozambique , the founding President of Mozambique , thousands of people gathered in the M@@ ap@@ u@@ to centre to outra@@ ged peaceful slog@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
&apos;@@ We want peace to come back ; we want stability &apos; , said V@@ an@@ ess@@ a de Sou@@ a , Director-General of an investment society .
In@@ qu@@ et for the future of his country , she has exchanged her working clo@@ thes against a te@@ e-@@ shir@@ t with the reference &apos; we want safety &apos; in Portuguese before joining the crow@@ ded crow@@ d on the place of the capital of the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and the Rena@@ ult , the worst c@@ lic@@ h@@ Ã©s since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago .
The Ren@@ o was once a famous rebel movement , supported initially by R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia , and then the South African apar@@ theid Government in the efforts to destabil@@ ise the country &apos;s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
The analy@@ sts believe that the country should not sli@@ p into an open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy , since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-@@ west could attract more than 50 M@@ F@@ s of investment in the coming years from companies such as Rio T@@ into , V@@ ale from Brazil , Italy , Italy and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko from the United States .
The F@@ re@@ li@@ m@@ o , the governing party and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and the Ren@@ o are mutually exclusive .
The Ren@@ o states that the government is at the root of the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of So@@ fa@@ la , a traditional bas@@ tion of the Ren@@ o , on 17 October .
The assa@@ ults on the former rebels then de@@ generated when government forces attacked the foundations of the Ren@@ o and tried to kill A@@ f@@ on@@ so D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the leader of the group , and Fer@@ nan@@ do M@@ az@@ ang@@ a , the spokesman for the Ren@@ o , according to the Financial Times .
The government is making the Ren@@ o responsible for trigg@@ ering conflicts and accused of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to minim@@ ize concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za said on Wednesday to the A@@ F@@ P , the French press agency , that Mr D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama considered himself a &apos; los@@ er &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he had left him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government &apos; .
The F@@ inter@@ m@@ o and the Rena@@ ult insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern was growing after Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that the Ren@@ o was abandoning the 1992 Peace Agreement .
He said to the F@@ T@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the F@@ link .
&apos;@@ We want to resume the negotiations , but with the greatest seriousness &apos; , Mr M@@ az@@ ang@@ a said .
Pre@@ vious discussions between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions that have been fu@@ elled by a series of conflicts this year .
&apos;@@ These are two great men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who do not stop fighting &apos; , explained Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ an@@ l@@ on , a conf@@ end@@ ant of the open and specialist university in Mozambique .
None of them can negotiate well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
The Ren@@ o , which is in favour of electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt by a patient movement to obtain concessions and a trea@@ sure of war on the part of the government .
The proportion of the votes collected by the Rena@@ ult has been steadily declining since 1992 , while a new party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( M@@ D@@ M ) , which was created by a former member of the Ren@@ o , should obtain more votes in the elections .
Mr Ma@@ zz@@ ang@@ a said that Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&apos;@@ He does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the Presidency &apos; , he said Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Ren@@ o is , but it has led to disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-@@ south motor@@ way .
Most of the cl@@ ou@@ ds have taken place in the province of So@@ fa@@ la , which is located several hundred kilometres away from the north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where there is Be@@ ira , the port where mining companies , especially Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale , export coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Ren@@ o threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was fal@@ sely ti@@ mid when he asked whether the Ren@@ o would respond to this threat .
The Ren@@ o wanted to &apos; warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique &apos; , mentioned Mr M@@ az@@ ang@@ a .
In@@ stability has strengthened the fru@@ stra@@ tions of the government , dec@@ la@@ res Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , the Director of Medic@@ are , an independent media society , many people being concerned about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
&apos;@@ People believe that those responsible for the country &apos;s future are the government and the President , and that it is up to the President to find solutions to the problems &apos; , he explained .
Om@@ ar S@@ ul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstration , said that people only wanted stability .
&apos;@@ No one ca@@ res about the Ren@@ o or F@@ eli@@ o , they just want to find peace , they want to have free access to the roads &apos; .
The my@@ ths and leg@@ s of children should be taught as &apos; lifestyle models &apos; , dec@@ la@@ res the author .
The Ho@@ ly Ho@@ od could show that &apos; the brutal force does not carry weight against sub@@ tle ru@@ ins &apos; , while the le@@ gen@@ d ar@@ ons reveal the importance of having a dream .
In saying that many my@@ ths would be &apos; far too violent , far too scandalous and in some cases far too obscure to be taught at school &apos; , C@@ us@@ le@@ y-@@ Holland called for a &apos; careful selection &apos; of the works adapted to age .
&apos;@@ I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education &apos; .
I have been arguing for this project for 20 years .
He has added that the fact that authors and teachers are &apos; openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &apos; means that children &apos; get off completely &apos; , the messages being &apos; sub@@ li@@ ed &apos; in pleasant stories .
S@@ us@@ le@@ y@@ -@@ Holland , who translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon and wrote The Pen@@ gu@@ in Bo@@ o@@ k of Nor@@ d My@@ th@@ s and British Fol@@ k T@@ ale , said : &apos; You may have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight &apos; .
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writ@@ er write for adults and an adult author who is written for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything should be simplified or done well , but there is an un@@ born sense of good and evil .
It must be sub@@ li@@ ed ; it must be revealed through a history rather than declared .
The basis of what is known and what is not said .
A combat@@ ant of the armed arm of Hamas was killed this evening and another w@@ ounded by an Israeli c@@ at sho@@ oting in the Gaza Strip , was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists led to a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a sh@@ ell@@ s of Israeli bl@@ und@@ ers .
E@@ mer@@ ging of the N@@ SA : the United States is &apos; going too far &apos; , ad@@ mitting Ker@@ ry Ker@@ ry
The United States has sometimes gone &apos; too far &apos; in the area of es@@ pion@@ age , acknowledged Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in the first round of Washington in full dispute with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the United States and their European allies , this is the first time that a US government official explicitly ad@@ mits controversial practices in the inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;@@ In some cases , I conc@@ ede you , as the President has done , some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to ensure that this is no longer in the future &apos; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London in which he was involved since Washington on Thursday 31 October in video .
In his repeated speech , in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , the US diplomatic leader has long justified the intelligence and gathering of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ king the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those from London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry assured that the US authorities had had a large number of terrorist projects , thanks to the inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and the collection of information .
&apos;@@ We have de facto prevented aircraft from falling , that buildings do not explo@@ de and that people are being murdered , because we were able to be informed up@@ stream of these projects &apos; , argued the pat@@ ron of American diplomacy .
And , as John Ker@@ ry said to Europeans , &apos; I assure you that in this process of innocent people were not mistaken &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;@@ And yes , in some cases , it has gone too far &apos; , has still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal at a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured us on Thursday evening that President Obama was &apos; resolved to try to clarify and carry out a review of these practices so that no one feels wrong &apos; .
However , the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o users .
The newspaper , which quot@@ es documents obtained from the former N@@ SA contr@@ actor Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , states that the programme called &apos; M@@ US@@ C@@ U@@ R &apos; , and conducted with the British N@@ SA counterpart , G@@ CC , allows these two agencies to recover data from the op@@ tical fi@@ b@@ res used by Internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , some 18@@ 1 million elements had been collected in the last month of January - from me@@ tal to e-@@ ma@@ ils , text parts or audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ cep@@ tions would take place outside the United States .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google have denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , a number of major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain or Italy have shown that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from allies from the United States and their leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
In the face of the anger of European states , and even though lea@@ ks in the US press claimed that the US President was not aware of such an listen , Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
On the other hand , the Pope of the powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ e@@ it@@ h Alexander , has denied him that his intelligence agency has cap@@ tured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He has even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications , before providing them with the N@@ SA .
This would relate to &apos; military operations &apos; in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States , and that would definitely not aim for Europe .
And the po@@ le@@ m@@ ics went to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia has called the ambassador of Australia , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international es@@ pion@@ age , which has also led to China being called to account .
The Sain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ hand@@ i Paris will receive L@@ ori@@ ent Friday without its master &apos;s master , the Swed@@ e Z@@ la@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , announ@@ ces the League 1 club in a communi@@ qu@@ Ã© .
The P@@ S@@ G , the leader of the cham@@ pion@@ ship in Mon@@ ac@@ o with the difference of purpose , has broadcast the list of players who have been detained for this 12@@ th Day match , without the att@@ achment of 32 years .
The communi@@ qu@@ Ã© simply says that he is &apos; injured &apos; , without specifying the nature of injury .
However , it was suffering from an inf@@ lam@@ ation of the left left when it returned to selection , at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony in memory of the de@@ pu@@ ties
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ er organis@@ es , at 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the well-@@ founded de@@ mar@@ ches in its establishment during the year .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , a socialist candidate in the Paris ma@@ ker , must attend , and will then explain at a press conference his proposals for fun@@ eral .
To follow the ceremony , c@@ lic@@ k above .
For their own obst@@ in@@ acy , more and more French people choose the creation , rather than in@@ hum@@ ation : 53 % , according to an I@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people , instead of 47 % .
For the sake of the ne@@ arest , it is the other way round : the French prefer to be hum@@ orous ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book Le Mor@@ t in ash , Dam@@ y Le Gu@@ ay , philosop@@ her and Vice-President of the National Committee on E@@ th@@ n@@ ic E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &apos; violence &apos; represented by the creation , for the survi@@ v@@ ors .
There is , with the creation , &apos; violence in the loved body &apos; , which is going to be &apos; reduced to a lot of ash &apos; in a very short space of time , and not after a process of dec@@ ay , which &apos; would accompany the phases of the m@@ our@@ ning &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which is aimed at &apos; wi@@ ping out the uni@@ qu@@ eness and distingu@@ ishing signs &apos; reduced to &apos; an@@ onym@@ ity &apos; of the ash .
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Pro@@ te@@ stant countries , and is it still a bad thing in France ?
&apos;@@ Because the creation is a new fact &apos; , Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ Ã©@@ ri@@ que B@@ ac@@ qu@@ Ã© , chair@@ woman of the Society of th@@ an@@ at@@ ology and author of the book , is a new one .
It is only tolerated since 196@@ 3 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to ap@@ portion it .
To call for creativity is for Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is Mic@@ ha@@ d-@@ N@@ Ã©r@@ ard , Director General of the fun@@ eral service of the City of Paris , to provide for the de@@ func@@ t a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with in@@ hum@@ ation .
The annual survey of I@@ f@@ so@@ s shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony .
77 % of French people want one , for their relatives , whether religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of people who have chosen a creation want a ceremony .
There are 66 % of the ath@@ le@@ tes or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ a has adapted to this development of society .
&apos;@@ For ten years now , they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the ashes of the ash &apos; .
70 % of the institutions now propose cere@@ mon@@ ial ma@@ sters , who carry out the next rit@@ ual , in the presence of the body : to welcome the Assembly , to name the de@@ func@@ t , to link it to the others , to talk about it , to give meaning to its death , to organise the good@@ by@@ e .
This is the case with the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ er , since 1998 .
The ma@@ sters of ceremony are often people who have converted .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ er organis@@ es , since 2010 , the day of the T@@ ous@@ sa@@ ult , several cere@@ mon@@ ial , secular and non-@@ religious cere@@ monies , to which he inv@@ ites the families of the people who have been created in the year .
For the second con@@ secu@@ tive year , one of these cere@@ monies is passed on to the attention of those who could not travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um has allowed us to pass it on .
In the S@@ ey@@ ne , the relocation of ra@@ b@@ ies
At the beginning of the week , a family left its a@@ partment in the middle of the F@@ ru@@ ti@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 building , due to the presence of r@@ ats .
In the face of the urgency of the situation , the Director of the Southern H@@ ab@@ it@@ at Office , the Director of the South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at , has proposed , in an exceptional and temporary manner , to reloc@@ ate the couple and three children in a T@@ 4 nine .
However , the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons &apos; and the situation is blocked .
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions , estimates Jo@@ el Can@@ ap@@ a , the Director of the Office .
There have always been r@@ ats in the cities .
The corpor@@ ation company makes two pass@@ ages a year and , in addition , we are doing our utmost to meet every request by the people .
We have done 64 speeches since the end of last winter .
The area is not left out , and the r@@ ats are not pul@@ ling into the city .
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health , the products of dec@@ re@@ ation are four times less efficient than in the past , but for two r@@ ats we will not kill a go@@ ose .
&apos;@@ We have not invited the r@@ ats at home &apos; , defending the father of the family who has left home to settle in ho@@ tel .
We are soon without a pen@@ ny and we expect a new housing , at the same tariff as the old one .
The To@@ k@@ yo Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change
The To@@ k@@ yo Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change ended on Friday , despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics .
The Co@@ te has suffered from the fall in the dollar against the yen , which is detrimental to exporting values and the warning about its annual result launched by S@@ ony on Thursday .
The Ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i index lost 12.@@ 37 points ( 0.@@ 88 % ) to 14 201@@ .@@ 57 and the T@@ op@@ i@@ x gave in 11.@@ 23 points ( 0.@@ 94 % ) to 1 18@@ 3.@@ 03 .

A house is pre@@ y to fl@@ ames in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c
A fire that took place at mid@@ day on Friday - Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c was quickly controlled .
More than 30 fire bri@@ g@@ ades were sent to 9 on the He@@ br@@ ert street .
The fl@@ ames have found themselves in a home of three homes divided over four parts behind the Court of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
Not all ten@@ ants were in the fire .
The fire was ma@@ stered one hour after the arrival of the fire bri@@ g@@ ades , many of whom were involved .
As soon as our first fire bri@@ g@@ ades arrived , they really saw smoke .
&apos;@@ Then the al@@ arms were followed up , because it took the step to attack the building , because it was buildings that were col@@ l@@ ated here &apos; , explained France L@@ Ã©@@ vis@@ her , spokesman for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire .
Ben Green@@ man : 10@@ th anniversary of New York
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand@@ -@@ up in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the de facto Fran@@ k F@@ ay player , who took the role of a master of ceremony in Pal@@ ace The@@ at@@ er , on Bro@@ ad@@ way , began to talk directly to the public , on the tone of the convers@@ ation .
The innovation of F@@ ay has continued over the years , until the New York F@@ es@@ ti@@ val has recently been re-@@ launched .
C@@ re@@ ed and super@@ vised by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ sch , the foun@@ der of the C@@ -@@ U@@ p Car@@ ol@@ ine club , the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectac@@ les presented in small clubs and major theat@@ res .
&apos;@@ Most of the post@@ ers have emerged in the Car@@ ol@@ ine , and have been a great success , until they have become too famous to play in a club &apos; , said H@@ ir@@ sch .
We have created this f@@ es@@ ti@@ val with the aim of continuing to work with them .
The event of this year will see the participation of W@@ anda Sy@@ k@@ es , K@@ a@@ thy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in and Bill Mah@@ er and the presentation of &apos; S@@ tan@@ d U@@ p for Her@@ es &apos; , a com@@ ic and music evening for the former combat@@ ants , organized in the Mad@@ ison S@@ pre@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , the J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , Ro@@ ger Wa@@ ters and Bill C@@ ho@@ by .
The f@@ es@@ ti@@ val has grown up , just like the world of the com@@ edi@@ e .
Many of the com@@ edi@@ ans involved in this year &apos;s f@@ es@@ ti@@ val have gone through non-@@ traditional cir@@ cu@@ its , for example , by setting out spectac@@ les on small television channels , such as CO@@ Ms Central , F@@ X and S@@ pi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ ro@@ ll appeared on the scene in a si@@ co@@ m on a c@@ able chain ( &apos; The Hague &apos; ) on the subject of the G@@ X@@ X project , which is je@@ al@@ ously l@@ aci@@ ously l@@ aci@@ ous , and now has its own spectac@@ le of sk@@ et@@ t@@ ches on the Central Com@@ al .
Jen@@ ny S@@ la@@ te took part in the programme &apos; St@@ ud@@ d@@ y Ni@@ gh@@ t L@@ ong &apos; and was part of the &apos; Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation &apos; series , but it is well known for its series of vide@@ os &apos; Mar@@ c@@ el the S@@ hell with S@@ ho@@ es &apos; .
K@@ ro@@ l@@ l and S@@ la@@ te , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans to the sing@@ ular voice ( the sur@@ real pessimis@@ tic An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k , the ir@@ ony of racial justice in the form of racial justice ) , are products produced by the decentr@@ alized world of the American com@@ ic .
One of the main attr@@ acti@@ veness of the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val this year will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg discussing Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg has started as a stand@@ ardi@@ zed com@@ ic , but it has become a film and television fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker , as well as an informal histor@@ ian of the com@@ ic .
Between 2005 and 2007 , it led to a broadcast on TV L@@ and , which was called &apos; S@@ it D@@ ow@@ n Com@@ ed@@ y &apos; .
The meeting is taking place at the H@@ ille Ho@@ tel in the centre of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
&apos;@@ The city is definitively in the com@@ ic DNA of all the work of Lar@@ ry &apos; , said Ste@@ in@@ berg .
He told me that , when he was here , sometimes he was a ru@@ de between two buildings and said , if I lose all my money , perhaps I will live here .
Oil prices continue to fall and move closer to $ 96 per bar@@ rel .
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday when concerns about the importance of stocks compensate for a report showing that the energy-@@ intensive Chinese manufacturing sector is becoming stronger .
The price of the US benchmark for delivery in December fell from 14 c@@ ents to USD 9@@ 6.@@ 24 per bar@@ rel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Ex@@ change ( N@@ Y@@ ME@@ X ) .
The contract lost 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it with a 5.@@ 8 % drop in October .
The abund@@ ant supply of crude oil has been weigh@@ ing on prices in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy indicated on Wednesday that US supplies rose by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to grow again after growth rose to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a fall that has not been known for two decades in the last quarter .
G@@ ross B@@ rent , a reference to the international crude already used by US refin@@ eries , lost 26 c@@ ents to fall to USD 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ rel on the Inter@@ -@@ Parliamentary Ex@@ change ( EC@@ E ) in London .
R@@ emo@@ ving the right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as
A federal court court has restored certain restrictions to T@@ ex@@ as to the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy , which had been blocked by a judge judge this week .
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The judgment made by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that doctors who will be practi@@ sing P@@ V@@ G will have to have a &apos; privilege &apos; to local hospitals .
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , in accordance with his status as a hospital member , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre in order to issue a diagnosis or treatment .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates of the I@@ V@@ G argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of the state clin@@ ics because these clin@@ ics have not managed to obtain this &apos; admission privilege &apos; for their practi@@ tioners .
In total , it would be almost 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions .
On Monday , a judge judge estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-@@ constitutional .
But the At@@ tor@@ ney General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican , Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who is holding the post of govern@@ or , asked the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to cancel the first-@@ instance judgment that blocked the application of the law .
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January .
The New Sta@@ r succeeded in a return in force , with the hearing , with 1.3 million view@@ ers behind their post post , or 5.@@ 6 % of audience .
But was it the case ?
Some 10 000 candidates came to the hearings of this 10@@ th season , to deal with the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ e , the S@@ inc@@ t , the Per@@ che An@@ dr@@ Ã© Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
The exc@@ itement to find their fav@@ our@@ ite programme , many were disappointed .
But why are so many disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As each year , the first hearing of hearing is a wide choice of grass , for the best and sometimes for the worst .
However , on T@@ wit@@ ter , you want to show a show , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fortunately , some of them found their accounts .
Many of them have tried the New Sta@@ r and sometimes even went to the end .
Beh@@ ind the television scre@@ ens , the vo@@ ys of success are still there , season after season .
Others have just the ambition to lau@@ gh .
The Court is blocking a decision on the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and control policy
A Federal Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al blocked on Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and control programme of the New York police department and made it clear .
The United States &apos; Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) has indicated that the decision of Jud@@ ge Shi@@ ra Sch@@ ee@@ in was suspended until after the city &apos;s appeal .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution as a result of the implementation of its programme to monitor and inter@@ rog@@ ate citizens .
The city has made use of its conclusions and corrective prescri@@ ptions , including a decision to give a supervis@@ or to help the police department change its policy and the training programme associated with it .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al heard the arguments on the request for suspension .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al said that the judge should be drawn from the dossier because it infring@@ ed the code of conduct of judges by endang@@ ering the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , partly because of a series of meetings given to the media and public statements in which she responded publicly to the Court &apos;s criticism .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and of panic in their control and search programme .
It has appointed an external supervis@@ or to over@@ see the changes , including the reform of policies , training and supervision , and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cam@@ er@@ as on the body in the areas where the largest number of controls are carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the call by the city should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The tactics of control and sear@@ ches have been criticised by many defenders of civil rights .
This system of control and sear@@ ches has been in existence for decades , but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ berg , to reach its highest historical level in 2011 , with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls that mainly related to black men and panic .
Ju@@ dic@@ ial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Those who advocate changes in the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and control programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices , make it possible to have more effective police forces and trust , and will be able to change the way in which police departments use politics .
Op@@ ponents say that these changes would undermine the mor@@ ale of the police without reducing crime , representing a waste of money and not solving the wider problem of the police forces under pressure after police officers have been considerably reduced over the last decade .
The judge has pointed out that it does not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but to reform the way in which the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D imple@@ ments its controls .
The ten@@ ants must vote , because each of them pays on average USD 100 per month on the price of housing that goes to the V@@ ill@@ es .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ ,000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des the amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes .
We are sending a clear message .
We need to change things in the City .
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay for fire@@ works to USD 100 000 , land from ECU 4@@ 5-@@ 5 million to the case where ...
To vote is the best way to speak and say that it is enough .
F@@ ine of the E@@ ly@@ s@@ Ã©@@ e
In the 500 m@@ 2 m@@ 2 of el@@ y@@ se@@ an k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , which was committed after working in embassies , the co@@ ok took every lad@@ der to the head , nine years ago .
He served six French presidents , Ge@@ org@@ es P@@ om@@ pid@@ ou to Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de , by way of Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , including on their holiday places , and fed an inc@@ al@@ cul@@ able number of the world &apos;s large numbers in a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ an@@ onym@@ ity that he only now breaks at the time of retirement .
The man with an open face , un@@ guar@@ ded and gl@@ asses of intellectual , born on 24 October 195@@ 3 to the Fer@@ te@@ -@@ Sain@@ t Au@@ bi@@ n , is a pa@@ w@@ n of a pa@@ thetic CAP .
His mother was a co@@ ok in a So@@ il cast@@ le .
&apos;@@ I have gone from one cast@@ le to another ! &apos; , ir@@ on@@ ise Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ te , who knows not only the six presidents for whom he has been u@@ no@@ fficial , but also their wi@@ ves and some of their gu@@ ests .
&apos;@@ It is always the Head of the State or his compan@@ ion or wife who choo@@ ses the men@@ us &apos; .
&apos;@@ Mrs Chirac was a little more involved , she came directly to k@@ it@@ ch@@ en &apos; , to the point she had banned women in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ Ã©@@ e k@@ it@@ ch@@ en !
W@@ ho@@ ever dis@@ agrees with the heads of state who had a relative indifference to land fe@@ eds , &apos; they are all g@@ ur@@ b@@ ish &apos; , denoun@@ cing Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ te .
Jacques Chirac certainly had &apos; a slightly more developed appe@@ ti@@ te &apos; .
But with Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , who had removed che@@ ese , the bases were empty !
As for Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de , who restored che@@ ese , &apos; it is someone who likes to eat &apos; and &apos; there is little that he does not like &apos; .
The current Head of State , who has reg@@ ain@@ ed the lost kil@@ os before the presidential campaign , has no application of a specific regime .
Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ te also re@@ members the pressure that has been placed on his shoulders , particularly at the State din@@ ners of the E@@ ly@@ s@@ Ã©@@ e : we have to use &apos; between 200 and 250 people in approximately one hour &apos; .
The night is almost white .
These people would not understand that there are mistakes .
The former head of the E@@ ly@@ s@@ Ã©@@ e k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , who took a glass on Tuesday evening with his team , family and friends , is part of the heart of &apos; Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de &apos; .
He said praise .
&apos;@@ His human side has emerged &apos; , he says .
The leader will be replaced by his deputy , Wil@@ hel@@ m G@@ ome@@ z , 35 years , who has for his part been in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ Ã©@@ e for 17 years .
F@@ air in a house built in 18@@ 50
An historic house built in 18@@ 50 was the pre@@ y to the fl@@ ames in the Li@@ be@@ be@@ c Friday Friday .
The building of four housing , in the 15 of the He@@ br@@ ert street , was the subject of three al@@ arms in the fire service .
The fire was said before , but it was on the three parts of the buildings .
France , the spokesman for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c fire protection service , made it clear that rapid action by the fire bri@@ g@@ ades prevented the spread of fire to ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where buildings are built in a close way .
The house bur@@ ned home was home to four homes , but no ten@@ ants were in the place at the time of the fire .
The damage was very limited , even though water caused damage .
An investigation will be carried out into the origin , but the criminals have removed the theory of a criminal act .

C@@ ou@@ ose used telephone piracy to check a tu@@ g in the face of a kill@@ er .
The former ed@@ itor of Ne@@ ws of the World , An@@ dr@@ y C@@ ou@@ l@@ son , would have used &apos; telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation &apos; to try to confirm a two-@@ way killing on a link with the Minister of the Interior , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
The Prosecutor An@@ drew E@@ says Q@@ C said in the court of the O@@ ld B@@ ai@@ ley that Ne@@ ws of the World had heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ an@@ na@@ h P@@ ow@@ l@@ by , his &apos; special special advis@@ er &apos; .
It was pointed out at the court that the newspaper G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ c@@ aire , a private de@@ vice , pir@@ ates P@@ ow@@ l@@ by &apos;s box , and &apos; planting in front of his own door &apos; , but C@@ ou@@ l@@ son also called it and gave him the green messages .
The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ ou@@ l@@ son , who is now the ed@@ itor of No@@ t@@ W , is not the kind of man to stay in the house of people in the hope of sur@@ prises , that is the kind of man to love the history of the people to see what they say .
He said that No@@ t@@ W used three means to investigate matters : telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation .
The ed@@ itor is personally involved in the third .
It is obvious that it is the second , supervision , it cannot be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is it aware of the telephone piracy ?
He says otherwise , but we say &apos; of course &apos; .
The rumours about a link involving C@@ lar@@ ke were first taken up by the office in No@@ t@@ W when a source , having a sexual attr@@ acti@@ veness to M@@ iss P@@ ow@@ l@@ by , said that he was told : &apos; Do not lose time with her , she is with Charles . &apos;
A g@@ ang , on which there were pir@@ ated messages on his phone at least three times , was seized at the home of the P@@ ic@@ ar in August 2006 .
The investig@@ ators have also found se@@ iz@@ ure on the computer of the private de@@ vice that concerned M@@ iss P@@ ow@@ l@@ by and his s@@ ister s@@ ister in a &apos; Pro@@ j@@ et &apos; dossier .
During the period when the de@@ vice investigated it , M@@ iss P@@ ow@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls for information on her , added Mr E@@ is .
In the meantime , the former N@@ ev@@ ille Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former def@@ er James We@@ a@@ er@@ up have over@@ seen the monitoring of the minor facts and gest@@ ures of M@@ iss P@@ ow@@ l@@ by .
In a vote that he left on 18 June 2005 , C@@ ou@@ l@@ son said : &apos; I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow , of which I would really like to speak in Charles . &apos;
Mr E@@ d@@ is has explained that the involvement of C@@ ou@@ son in history has followed the same pattern with other important men , such as the former Minister of Interior David B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury was heard on Thursday that C@@ ou@@ son had to deal with Mr B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t about a connection with a married woman when he himself was a co-@@ defen@@ der Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ ou@@ k and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny that they have con@@ spi@@ red with others to pir@@ ate tele@@ phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
M@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ a@@ ther@@ up have admitted that they have made telephone piracy .
Barack Obama is receiving the Prime Minister of Iraq , in the middle of violence
The US President was supposed to receive the Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki on Friday , 1 November 2013 , seeking help from the United States to combat the strongest wave of violence for five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published on Friday , 1 November by the Iraqi authorities .
9@@ 64 people died in the violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN provides an even higher balance sheet with 9@@ 79 deaths and 1 9@@ 02 injured .
These violence is increasingly mur@@ der@@ ous despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of N@@ our@@ i Al M@@ ali@@ ki , dominated by the Shi@@ ites .
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people had been killed .
Two years after the withdrawal of US troops , the level of violence leads to a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation when neighbouring Syria is in the grip of a civil war .
C@@ ars are hit by markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ eral .
Men are slaughtered on the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s to be politically marginalised and to be the target of unjust arrests , has encouraged this outbreak of violence .
On Friday , new violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars trapped in the north of Baghdad .
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( EI@@ I@@ L ) , a group aff@@ ili@@ ated with al-@@ Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , also involved in the civil war in Syria .
N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants a &apos; global war &apos; against al-@@ Qaeda .
Violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i Al M@@ ali@@ ki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting , on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the US President , elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country , had pain@@ ted an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington , N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki has multi@@ plied the meetings with the executive , and the elected representatives of Congress .
On Thursday he called for the international community to conduct a &apos; third world war &apos; against al-@@ Qaeda .
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican sen@@ ators and democrats .
But the latter also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a Shi@@ ite , for a partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &apos; sec@@ tarian and authoritarian policy &apos; .
They have also asked Barack Obama to make it clear to N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki that &apos; Iran &apos;s per@@ nic@@ ious influence in the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship &apos; .
Beijing acc@@ uses a U@@ igh@@ ur Group of the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men attack
China &apos;s internal security leader accused a group of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang separati@@ sts on Friday of being behind the bomb attack on the car , which claimed five deaths in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the centre of Beijing on Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V , has sun@@ k on the crow@@ d that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital , a symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression carried out in 1989 , and sho@@ oting its three passengers and two smugg@@ lers .
Men@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the political Bureau responsible for internal security issues , accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan to be the instig@@ ator of this attack .
Many U@@ igh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ based minority in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese province East Tur@@ ke@@ stan .
For the Chinese Government , this movement is responsible for the frequent erup@@ tions of violence that occur there by means of independence claims .
&apos;@@ The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organised and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &apos; , said M@@ g to the Hong Kong P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x TV channel .
&apos;@@ The group that was held behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan &apos; , he added , as he said , by the new China agency .
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur and made it clear that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained no@@ ises full of petrol and a flag with Or@@ thodox religious en@@ vo@@ ys .
The incident made 42 injured .
Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on contrac@@ eption , divorce and homosexu@@ ality
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has undertaken to conduct a major survey throughout the world on how the par@@ ks handle sensitive issues such as contrac@@ eption , divorce and couples of the same sex .
The poll asks the participants how pri@@ ests look after gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage .
The poll was sent in the middle of October to each national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , with a sign of obtaining as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important gathering on the family that Pope Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is is planning next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the &apos; National Ca@@ thol@@ ic Re@@ porting &apos; , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokes@@ person for the Conference of Catholic b@@ ish@@ ops in the United States confirmed that the document was auth@@ enti@@ c and that every b@@ is@@ ho@@ p would decide how to s@@ cra@@ p the par@@ ks .
In the UK , b@@ ish@@ ops have published the Internet survey , asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .

&apos;@@ It has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continues in spite of night &apos; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P a inhabit@@ ant of J@@ om@@ a , joined by telephone at 12.@@ 30 p.m. , and according to whom a gir@@ l was injured in the morning .
&apos;@@ The intensity of clashes has fallen somewhat &apos; , he added , &apos; it seems that the F@@ ARC For@@ ces of the DR@@ C have pushed the rebels a little . &apos;
According to this witness wishing to remain an@@ onymous , the soldiers had &apos; spent the night &apos; in J@@ om@@ b@@ a before standing on the front for a &apos; ra@@ ging operation &apos; .
There was a very clear understanding of the fact that there was a lot of light .
From B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , political fi@@ ef@@ dom@@ s and the last strong place of the re@@ bel@@ lion on Wednesday , a journalist from the A@@ F@@ P could hear heavy weapons de@@ ton@@ ations .
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DR@@ C , the fighting went &apos; in a final phase &apos; , with the F@@ ARC having &apos; en@@ du@@ red the positions of the 23 resid@@ es to de@@ part &apos; .
Since the resumption , on Friday , of clashes between the Movement of 23 M@@ ars ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , the Mon@@ us@@ co is not directly involved in the fighting , but it provides the government with significant support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several tens of soldiers , who were well supplied with muni@@ tions , were moving towards the front line .
They were armed with k@@ al@@ ach@@ ni@@ kov and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , post-@@ border with Uganda , the military ai@@ ded by civilians was carrying a multi@@ fac@@ eted roc@@ ket roc@@ ket on a F@@ R@@ DC inf@@ ant tr@@ uck , which is to be seen by another en@@ sla@@ vement p@@ iling the positions of M@@ 23 on h@@ ills .
The Congolese President , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , called on the rebels on Wednesday evening to &apos; demo@@ bil@@ ise &apos; or to be dis@@ armed by force , but left the K@@ amp@@ ala process open , where Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been discussing it since December .
On the ground , the political leaders of the M@@ 23 are hoping to reach an agreement .
&apos;@@ We have finished the talks , it is only the Ug@@ and@@ an mediation to organise the signing &apos; , said Ro@@ ger L@@ um@@ ba@@ a , Vice-President of the M@@ 23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
The M@@ 23 was born of a mut@@ iny , in April 2012 , of former rebels , mostly tu@@ t@@ si , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ali and K@@ amp@@ ala refu@@ te .
North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated areas of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ soil is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mining resources .
In B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where there were around 5@@ 000 people between Monday and Wednesday , according to the UN , the movement of return to the DR@@ C , which took place in the morning , reversed in the middle of the day .
&apos;@@ This morning we went through to our fields , but the military told us to go back &apos; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ u@@ si , surrounded by its nine children , including one on the back .
There is the impression that the fire is coming closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of residents crossed the border , some with a head@@ line match , to spend the night in Uganda .
The mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ound
C@@ l@@ assi@@ fied , sophisticated , popular , in English or French , soft and d@@ an@@ ced produc@@ tions take their flight .
After Bro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It is a revolution : mu@@ si@@ cal to French is a success story .
L@@ ong@@ s from Paris from Paris to Mo@@ z@@ art to Mo@@ z@@ art , most of the attempts are being made in a ridiculous way .
And the successes such as C@@ ab@@ ar@@ et or the M@@ is@@ try were the he@@ ight of the myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ in in Ch@@ ast@@ ella and S@@ et@@ tlement - En@@ ter@@ prise in Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or has changed the situation .
Today , these two scenes are handling headlines as successful tu@@ bes .
The first is , this Christmas , its excellent M@@ air F@@ air in Lad@@ y and announ@@ ces that the global creation of &apos; an American in Paris &apos; should be established .
In Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or , &apos; B@@ she and B@@ ast &apos; may well be one of the successes of the season .
On the other scenes , mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les such as &apos; 17@@ 89 &apos; , &apos; the am@@ ate@@ urs of the Bas@@ til@@ le &apos; and the small mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans such as &apos; Dis@@ co &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are being put at the mercy of success and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , the author of the &apos; History of mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ e &apos; reference book and conf@@ ers the Ch@@ ast@@ er &apos;s The@@ ast@@ er , analyses the reasons for such a hard-@@ won success .
How do the French mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ounds evolve ?
The offer has increased .
First of all , there is the &apos; music spectac@@ les &apos; that evolve as producers ...
Some of them are using fine images of images and a real history as in 17@@ 89 , the A@@ man@@ ts of the Bas@@ til@@ le .
Others take a leap of 15 years back on the pretext that you can be used to a little or nothing when you have Mat@@ t - Po@@ k@@ or@@ a at the head of the post@@ er .
After that , we have mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ounds with the s@@ om@@ p@@ ous production of Ch@@ ast@@ el@@ i , which brings us back to the golden age of Bro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay and to discover the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ he@@ he@@ m , the largest living com@@ pos@@ er .
S@@ et@@ tlement - En@@ ter@@ prise popul@@ ar@@ ise of the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ tions by adapting them in French .
Independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough .
However , projects under way as &apos; R@@ ose &apos; , &apos; The B@@ ail@@ er of Women &apos; or &apos; S@@ aw@@ le of the spring &apos; , have difficulty in being financed .
Do we have enough artists who are able , like Bro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay , to play and d@@ ance ?
In Paris , when there are eight music spectac@@ les in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 tal@@ ents who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , the cra@@ dle of music is very different .
Young people are trained in many schools .
There is a lot of jobs between the regional theat@@ res , the tur@@ f , Bro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay , the off@@ -@@ B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way ...
The tal@@ e of talent is as high as the number of posts to be filled .
Why are the tour@@ na@@ ments in the province so successful ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor parent of culture in France .
Fe@@ w parts of theat@@ re go around , and it is often the case of a bu@@ ff@@ er for adults and not young adults .
The mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les fill this gap .
It is these same young people who love tele@@ reality and what it produces as ep@@ hem@@ eral st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful , often tal@@ ented young men at the top of a mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ le is an assurance of an inf@@ low of these young girls and often of their entire family .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these spectac@@ les are so@@ rely - held by professionals who answer questions .
These spectac@@ les are very expected when they arrive in a Len@@ in in province .
The Ama@@ y@@ na@@ ise is rising in Paris and disgu@@ ised by prov@@ in@@ cial prov@@ in@@ cial prov@@ in@@ men .
The s@@ ho@@ w is designed to enter all the major sal@@ ts in France in the same form as in Paris .
A serious injury in an accident with a gh@@ o@@ st driver
A road accident made a serious w@@ ounded , on Friday morning at 6.@@ 30 p.m. , on the home home in Brussels at the he@@ ight of Ho@@ e@@ il@@ art , in the direction of W@@ ater@@ lo@@ o .
The car of a driving force was lost by a gh@@ o@@ st driver who is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
R@@ ing was closed to circulation , up to 900 , in the case of the accident , the time that the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
However , this situation has not caused any traffic j@@ ams because the accident took place at the he@@ ight of the H@@ os@@ il@@ a@@ art exit .
The circulation of traffic has therefore been removed from this exit / entry .
A child injured in an attr@@ action to Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris
A five-year child was seriously injured following an accident on an attr@@ acti@@ veness to Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris .
Its vital prog@@ no@@ sis is no longer committed , but it is still hosp@@ it@@ alised .
At the time of the fall , the bo@@ y was with his father on a ship of the attr@@ acti@@ veness of the Caribbean .
It has been closed down .
DR@@ C :
Children are playing a carbon bl@@ under that belong@@ ed to the rebels of M@@ 23 , in K@@ uri@@ m@@ ba , on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the last bas@@ tion of the rebels of M@@ 23 near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana in the east of the DR@@ C .
The aim is to de@@ loc@@ ate the M@@ 23 of the h@@ ills that over@@ lap B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Yesterday we took the h@@ ill in Bu@@ g@@ in@@ ia , which over@@ shad@@ ows that of M@@ bu@@ z@@ i .
Today , M@@ bu@@ z@@ i should fall by himself .
The h@@ ill of R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i will remain .
&apos;@@ C@@ ho@@ ice is not very strategic &apos; , has indicated the F@@ F@@ P the Govern@@ or of North Ki@@ v@@ u , Ju@@ tie P@@ uc@@ k@@ u .
Mr P@@ uc@@ k@@ u plans to travel on Saturday .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans and the last strong place of the re@@ bel@@ lion , this town is located on the Ug@@ and@@ an border , about 80 km north of G@@ om@@ a .
It was taken on Wednesday by the Ar@@ med For@@ ces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday .
E@@ ver since , a few hundreds of ir@@ reduc@@ tible from M@@ 23 have been left to almost 2 000 metres of al@@ titude on the agricultural h@@ ills of Chan@@ nel , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bu@@ z@@ i , near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and the neighbouring town of J@@ om@@ a
In J@@ om@@ b@@ a , an inhabit@@ ant who had reported that there was a close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said that the situation was &apos; calm since this morning &apos; .
He says that a woman and his child were killed by the fighting on the eve and buried .
A gir@@ l was w@@ ounded by the ball , and three people were injured , including a complaint , evac@@ uated by the F@@ ARC , added this witness cited by the A@@ F@@ P .
Since the resumption of fighting between F@@ ARC and rebels on 25 October , the two war@@ ring parties have not given any assessment of the loss of human life .
The N@@ SA re@@ vel@@ ations increase the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance of state surveillance
By a good day at the end of August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter over@@ flying the British Con@@ su@@ l@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , the financial capital of Germany .
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the German National Int@@ elli@@ gence Agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the US fore@@ run@@ ner , located at less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explain that the B@@ f@@ V hoped to see the presence of listening an@@ ten@@ s and that the operation triggered an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James C@@ l@@ ap@@ er , the Director of US intelligence services , once again insisted in September that the United States does not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to &apos; ste@@ al the industrial secre@@ ts of foreign companies for American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits &apos; .
But since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the consul@@ tant who has become whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers , has begun to un@@ cover his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble trea@@ sure of information about US surveillance secre@@ ts , European governments and business leaders no longer know if the director is to be believed .
Re@@ ports , according to which the US National Security Agency sp@@ ies the Brazilian oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as , has had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in C@@ oul@@ d , in particular Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have more than ever ar@@ oused the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance .
The re@@ vel@@ ation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s telephone had been pir@@ ated , perhaps even for a decade , has been the drop of water that has sh@@ run@@ k .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then business leaders are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent .
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used in their mutual interest .
&apos;@@ Germany must wake up &apos; , declare O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ Ã¼@@ n , President of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , representing German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the United States is such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to an investigation published in July by the E@@ Y board .
However , in all the documents un@@ ve@@ iled by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there is no indication so far that the United States has passed foreign secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Business leaders are sceptical about this .
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only close my eyes and re-@@ open them slowly ...
&apos;@@ That is not the right way to go &apos; , it says H@@ ass@@ o Pl@@ att@@ ner , the President of the German company company company SA@@ P .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then we should not let it die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , coal to cars and farmers .
Everything except the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistic@@ ation of US sp@@ ying agencies exposed by S@@ now@@ den &apos;s re@@ vel@@ ations were a shock for some companies that believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of supervision .
A major change is taking place in the cl@@ oud computer , as European leaders have become aware that the data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable .
According to an investigation carried out by the C@@ oul@@ d Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-@@ US members have given up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cl@@ oud after the re@@ vel@@ ations on the US Ex@@ pl@@ oration of P@@ ris@@ m data .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &apos; Our customers are now asking us a question that they were not asking us a year ago : where are my data retained and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that court ? &apos;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew , namely that the powerful states want to fly their most precious secre@@ ts and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is not surprising that there is economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There has always been .
It has been a recur@@ ring theme for many years , and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion &apos; , dec@@ la@@ res Kur@@ t Bo@@ c@@ k , Director General of the B@@ AS@@ F chemicals company .
The Americans are sp@@ ying on business and industrial , just as we are sp@@ ies , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
En@@ treprene@@ urs are usually unwilling to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place , if that would leave the advantage of an ad@@ versary .
The large companies have long been mar@@ ching the message that it is at least un@@ wise to recover a free U@@ S@@ B in a professional sal@@ t or to leave a lap@@ sed computer without supervision in a ho@@ tel room .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ac@@ k@@ enberg , a member of the Board of Direc@@ tors of the Au@@ to Au@@ tom@@ otive Au@@ tom@@ otive , says that the collection of mobile phones prior to the Council meetings , so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices , has been common practice for years .
Germany &apos;s B@@ f@@ V advis@@ es its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones in their travel abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of the mar@@ t@@ ph@@ ons .
The mobile phones paid are then thrown .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and supervision .
Many SMEs in Germany are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&apos;@@ SMEs often lack experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access &apos; , warned B@@ f@@ V in a report .
The US is warning their own companies about the economic sp@@ ying activities carried out by other countries .
The US National Int@@ elli@@ gence E@@ ti@@ mad@@ te ( N@@ I@@ E ) carried out in February by the United States , cited France , as was Russia and Israel , guilty of the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence , behind China , according to the Washington Po@@ st .
A member of the board of directors of a re@@ now@@ ned German company felt that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &apos; the French are the worst &apos; .
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ 40 , the former French Internal Int@@ elli@@ gence Director , the D@@ C@@ R@@ I , said in an interview this month : &apos; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , are sp@@ ying their allies . &apos;
The parents of a teen@@ age Georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , believe that their son was murdered .
The parents of an ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent of Georgia , whose body was found in a rou@@ gh ru@@ g in the gy@@ m@@ n@@ ate of his school , think that their son was murdered , declared the family lawyer on Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , from Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on 11 January stuck in a car@@ pe@@ l@@ t of a car@@ pe@@ t behind the gra@@ des of the gy@@ m@@ n@@ ate of his school .
The sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff investig@@ ators of the Coun@@ ty de L@@ ow@@ n@@ des concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son died in un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited circumstances , but the family of the seven@@ teen@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y con@@ tests these conclusions .
&apos;@@ They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered &apos; , said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ m@@ p , the lawyer representing Ken@@ ne@@ th and J@@ ac@@ lo@@ n Joh@@ n@@ son , on F@@ paradox New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
They have never thought that he is dead as it is in the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff conclusions .
&apos;@@ They think that it de@@ fies logic , physical laws and common sense &apos; , added C@@ ru@@ p .
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered with the sole aim of covering the people responsible for the death of their son .
&apos;@@ They sent their son to school with a car@@ table , and they made them in a mor@@ tu@@ ary ba@@ g &apos; , he added .
The US Public Prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , pointing out that a number of important issues remained un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
Mo@@ ore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I will follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My aim is to discover the truth .
&apos;@@ I think there is a sufficient basis &apos; to open an official investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore said to journalists that the first author@@ op@@ sy indicated that Joh@@ n@@ son was dec@@ eived by &apos; posi@@ tioning &apos; .
However , a second Au@@ top@@ sy has identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&apos;@@ A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation &apos; .
Mo@@ ore added that if he up@@ dates elements that justify a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , he will ask the F@@ B@@ I to conduct it .
The representative of the Coun@@ ty Office of L@@ ow@@ n@@ des was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him on Thursday .
A judge from southern Georgia ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video record@@ ings that the investig@@ ators had examined .
The parents of the teen@@ age have said that they expect video images to contain indic@@ es about the circumstances of his death .
The CD@@ C publ@@ ishes advice on aller@@ gies in children to schools
On Wednesday , the US Centre for Dis@@ ease Control has published a series of directives indicating how to manage children &apos;s food aller@@ gies in school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publ@@ ishes , since the number of children in school age with food aller@@ gies has so@@ ared .
A child in 20 in the United States now suffers from food aller@@ gies .
The CD@@ C found that the pre@@ valence of food aller@@ gies in the child rose by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise the awareness of the prof@@ es@@ sion@@ ary body and staff for food aller@@ gies in the child , and how to treat them in the event of aller@@ gic reactions .
It also recommends that schools should have a sp@@ ac@@ h@@ ine stock - the self-@@ injec@@ ting of the E@@ pi@@ P@@ en mark being the most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially leth@@ al an@@ ap@@ la@@ x@@ ia .
The legislative assemb@@ lies of the Member States have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily found sp@@ ac@@ ep@@ ine in stock .
The report also includes a list of the typical symptoms provided by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
Children can say , &apos; I have the impression that there is something that makes me feel the language &apos; , &apos; I have the impression that I have a ha@@ ir on the language &apos; or &apos; I have p@@ lots on language &apos; .
The N@@ SA case highlights the complete absence of a debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which is ho@@ sting in public by conven@@ ing the United States ambassador on 21 October , and on the other banning the over@@ flying of the territory by the Boli@@ vian presidential plane , on the basis of the rum@@ our of the presence on the board of Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de phone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent F@@ abil@@ us unequivocal the US ambassador , they react to a true discovery , which is the size of the US surveillance of all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the Mon@@ de &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns in a few weeks &apos; time , on the one hand , the reproduction of US diplomatic correspon@@ dence and , on the other , a condemnation of the H@@ az@@ i Qu@@ ai of the N@@ SA ?
Would it not be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part ?
The journ@@ alistic approach is not moral posi@@ tioning , but research into the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks lift the ve@@ il on American diplomacy on political or other issues around the world , we consider that , in the light of American power , this is an important light .
When we describe the US inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is not in any way to show us that this is a practice to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the N@@ SA on terrorist operations for our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The fact that the United States , but also France , has been in place for a large ten years , has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Moreover , in this area , France and the United States , in particular , have put in place almost daily cooperation and exchange of information and are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal areas in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sh@@ ah was reported to the French by means of the N@@ SA .
France can be led , for example , to trans@@ mit whole blocks of data on the Sa@@ hel region to US services , and in return - as has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world .
Therefore , the underlying question behind this N@@ SA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have inter@@ c@@ eption tools , that the issue of the complete lack of prior debate , particularly in the parliaments , on the justification of such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be their own , and ultimately the issue of violations of freedoms .
What is the real risk of the US ?
It is true , I do not see how they can be punished .
The risk of the Americans may be two@@ fold .
The first is when their allies - and this was the case recently - learn that their leaders , sometimes at the highest summit in their state , have been monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have stra@@ ined .
Another effect may be more econom@@ ical : more and more European or South American companies are reluctant , in the light of re@@ vel@@ ations , to hand over their confidential data to US providers who are subject to American laws , and thus to the capture of the N@@ SA .
Last but not least , the vast movement of re@@ vel@@ ations initiated by media throughout the world , which contributes to a debate on the surveillance practices of the hitherto virtually non-existent intelligence services , could encourage legislators , including American legislators , to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services .
Pa@@ rents of sex@@ ually motivated children can choose &apos; in@@ determined sex &apos;
Germany became the first European nation to recognise a third gender for inf@@ ants born with ambiguous sex organs .
The male and female gender of the new born will no longer be allocated , in a rigid way , to birth .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child , allowing them to include an &apos; in@@ determined &apos; or &apos; no specified &apos; sex on its birth certificate .
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure that was placed on parents who could take ha@@ sty decisions concerning a sur@@ gical sur@@ ge@@ on of sexual reg@@ en@@ eration for their inf@@ ants , and to combat discrimination against sex@@ u@@ ality .
According to the B@@ BC , an inter@@ sex@@ y person would have said years later , &apos; I am neither a man nor a woman . &apos;
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work that has been created by doctors , con@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed and br@@ ush@@ ed .
It is estimated that a child of 2 000 born every year is neither a bo@@ y nor a daughter .
They are sex@@ ually motivated , sex@@ u@@ ality as part of the group of the 60 diseases diagno@@ sed as a disorder of sexual development , a generic term that design@@ ates people with ch@@ ro@@ m@@ om@@ om@@ es or g@@ lu@@ ades ( o@@ v@@ res or m@@ es@@ cu@@ les ) at@@ yp@@ ical or un@@ ab@@ normal sexual organs .
S@@ imp@@ son S@@ imp@@ son could have been inter@@ sex@@ ined .
S@@ ex@@ ual identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined , it is better to use the best information available to award it , then to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a sur@@ gical act , if necessary .
Dr J@@ ack D@@ res@@ her , a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and a specialist on the issue of sexual identification , said that the new German law &apos; seems to be a good idea &apos; .
S@@ ex@@ ual children pose an ethical dilemma .
&apos;@@ Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a sur@@ gical act , but that is not the case with most children &apos; , he added .
It is possible to make sexual as@@ sign@@ ation without operation and to see how identity develops .
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
Nobody can answer the question as to why this is happening .
It is like the myster@@ y surrounding gay people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the sex@@ u@@ als as different from trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender people , since their status is not linked to gender but rather to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively of a woman , but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either one or the other .
These characteristics can be shown by themselves in secondary sex terms , such as mus@@ e@@ um mass , ste@@ ep@@ ness , ch@@ ick@@ ens and stat@@ ure , the primary sexual characteristics ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um and hormones .
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by sexual and trans@@ gender people in employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and motivated crimes .
Non-@@ compli@@ ant young boys now have camps that are specifically intended for them .
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to include male , female or third gender in their official documents .
In June , an Austr@@ ali@@ an 52 years , Nor@@ ri@@ e May@@ -@@ W@@ el@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been recognised &apos; neutral &apos; after having won his trial trial that allows him to retain a &apos; non-@@ specified &apos; gender .
German passports will include a third appointment other than M or F - X for sex@@ u@@ ality , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a reporting broadcast to France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of law@@ makers in this country of fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for &apos; gender theory &apos; to be withdrawn from school books .
The American Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ic On@@ line site also opposed the German law , writ@@ ing that &apos; since the world is dra@@ gged into a new reign where gender is a choice , but where sexual activity is not one , two other pillars of civilisation are over@@ turned . &apos;
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of an inf@@ ant also said on B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth .
&apos;@@ The role of parent is sufficiently stressed without any additional restrictions , especially if you do not know the gender of your child &apos; , she said on the website for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sex bodies were called her@@ m@@ ro@@ ps , according to the name of the beautiful Greek go@@ d , who had a double gender .
Just ten years ago , the medical community considered gender as an ar@@ do@@ s , which can be deleted and which can be re@@ drawn .
Now , however , many people are calling into question the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong , not knowing how a child will feel its sexual reg@@ en@@ eration when it grows .
In the middle of the 20th century , it was called a psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency .
When these children were born , you were not called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , you were telephone sur@@ ge@@ on .
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr John Mon@@ ey , the University of Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins , who considered gender to be m@@ alle@@ able .
He devoted the term &apos; sexual identity &apos; and argued that social and environmental signals - the way in which parents raise a child - inter@@ act with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male and female .
But in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as John / Jo@@ an , his the@@ ories gave rise to controversy .
He had advised the parents of a small bo@@ y whose pain had been cut off in a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se circum@@ c@@ ision to make him bur@@ y completely , and also to remove him from the m@@ es@@ cu@@ les , and to raise it as a daughter .
&apos;@@ Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transition , but that was not the case &apos; .
At the age of 15 years he became a bo@@ y and married with a woman .
But , at 38 years , he followed .
He said that some doctors &apos; always repeat this model &apos; .
But in the 1990s , with the arrival of the Internet , those who survived these gender@@ -@@ change operations say &apos; they are not satisfied with the result &apos; .
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-old writ@@ er of the Mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with male ch@@ ro@@ m@@ om@@ es , but ambiguous sexual organs .
Do@@ c@@ tors could not really say if he had a broad c@@ lic@@ h@@ is or a little s@@ ong and was convinced that he could never have a &apos; satisfactory life &apos; as a man .
So little time after its birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered a sur@@ gical ab@@ jec@@ tion of the external body and of the m@@ es@@ cu@@ les and was high as a daughter .
It has been taken by female hormones at the age of 12 .
&apos;@@ I knew that I was not a daughter &apos; , he said about A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 years , he has suffered a v@@ ag@@ in@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ cope .
But de@@ pressed and realising that something was wrong , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horri@@ fied .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth - and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( D@@ D@@ S ) , which prevented its body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one for its sexual organs to develop .
Having learned the truth , he has become a man , following a treatment of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one and has taken the se@@ ins away .
The sur@@ ger@@ y made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he is defending the cause of others in an organisation known as Pro@@ ject Pro@@ ject , which tries to norm@@ alise the perception of sex@@ u@@ ality .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ ti@@ s , the general leader of the non-@@ profit organization based in California Ad@@ voc@@ ates for In@@ formed Cha@@ ice , fears that German law &apos; calls for labelling and stig@@ ma@@ tisation &apos; .
&apos;@@ Many activists are worried that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child an &apos; in@@ determined &apos; gender , has said .
We are afraid that it encourages interventions .
We think it would be better to give a male or female gender and wait .
But we have not seen what the law is going to give , so we can only put forward hypo@@ thes@@ es .
Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ s said that his organisation supported Austr@@ ali@@ an law because &apos; it allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third gender name &apos; .
&apos;@@ adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind &apos; .
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth .
It is not a battle that young children should lead to this age .
When they grow , they will be able to take decisions on their own bodies .
But Dr Ar@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , a radi@@ olog@@ ist speci@@ alising in the ma@@ m@@ mo@@ graph@@ s in Pit@@ t@@ s@@ burgh , whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and which helps thousands of people in a support group , has said that the German law will &apos; make parents and children &apos; responsible .
The daughter of Dr Bar@@ at@@ z , K@@ ey , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ os@@ s , but suffers from a D@@ D@@ S known as complete in@@ sensitivity to an@@ dra@@ ges .
As a result of the failure of its an@@ dra@@ genous recei@@ vers , K@@ ey has developed female characteristics .
It has a v@@ ag@@ ine , but it has no eggs or eggs .
Today , in the age of 29 years , K@@ ey is married and internal psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry in the University of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
Even though it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or by carrying them .
&apos;@@ The law gives parents a certain amount of la@@ titude so that they do not have to make ha@@ sty decisions &apos; .
This gives them time to make certain tests and to understand them , and a deadline before putting &apos; male &apos; or &apos; femin@@ ine &apos; .
So everything is fine - you can raise your child and love it .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being relative .
You do not have to rush for sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
&apos;@@ This puts children at the heart of the decision and atten@@ ds the sense of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need &apos; .
Finally , the child will decide with what gender he feels the / most at ease - and that is something wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .
Le@@ t@@ ta on the long@@ ev@@ ity of its government
The President of the Italian Council En@@ ric@@ o Le@@ t@@ ta judge that his government will keep up to 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate &apos;s vote in favour of Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi of his mandate .
In a daily interview with the Sta@@ mp@@ a , the cen@@ ter-@@ left leader said &apos; firmly the intention &apos; to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015 .
The Italian Parliament &apos;s upper house will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate , where he has more ad@@ vers@@ aries than supporters , makes his ruling .
However , one part of its camp , grou@@ ped around the National Secretary of the Pe@@ op@@ les of Freedom ( P@@ D@@ L ) , continues to support the government , as demonstrated by its refusal to give in to the orders of Berlusconi , which already wanted to bring down the cabinet , on 2 October .
The L@@ .@@ A@@ . Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Safety Agency , T@@ SA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire .

&apos;@@ There was a sho@@ ot@@ y &apos; , declared to the A@@ F@@ P a spokes@@ person for the US Transport Safety Agency ( T@@ SA ) .
The local an@@ ten@@ e of A@@ BC showed a person who was evac@@ uated on a shop , and a second transported on a whe@@ el@@ chair .
The incident took place at 9.@@ 30 p.m. ( 12.@@ 30 in Mon@@ tre@@ al ) at the ter@@ minal 3 of the airport , which also made the airport clear .
The L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Times says that t@@ ems 2 and 3 are being evac@@ uated .

The Israeli army k@@ ills a Hamas member in Gaz@@ a-@@ s@@ these
Israeli tanks were killed on Thursday by an Islamist Palestinian milit@@ ant of Hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip .
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting in this region has erup@@ ted , because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and have been targeted by Palestinian mor@@ als .
The Israeli army has simply referred to a &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a so-called &apos; terrorist &apos; tunnel by the Jewish State , which is dig@@ ging on the border and whose discovery was announced in the middle of October .
Report : Obama &apos;s campaign to allow H@@ id@@ en
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers have considered , in the utmost secrecy , to replace Vice-President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en by H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most striking event in the very anticipated book of the 2012 campaign of Mar@@ k Hal@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ an@@ n , &apos; D@@ ouble D@@ ow@@ n : G@@ ame C@@ ange 2012 &apos; .
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and said on Thursday evening that the President &apos;s close collabor@@ ators had carried out &apos; in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 &apos; to see whether B@@ id@@ en &apos;s ev@@ ic@@ tion could help Obama with his re-@@ election when his hopes were w@@ an@@ ing .
According to the Times J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin political correspon@@ dent , the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials in the campaign and of the White House , namely the former General Secretary of the White Bill Bill Des@@ e@@ y , to assess the effect of replacing the Vice-President with former Secretary of State Clinton .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fier@@ cely kept in the Q@@ G in Chic@@ ago and within the o@@ val Bureau .
Only half a dozen close advisers from the President - in particular , Des@@ e@@ y , Obama &apos;s former campaign leader J@@ im M@@ ess@@ ina and the former advis@@ ors to the White House David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David P@@ le@@ ff@@ e - knew that change was in the pipeline .
&apos;@@ D@@ ouble D@@ ow@@ n &apos; indicates that Des@@ e@@ y has led the way to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their &apos; close personal links &apos; , before finally deciding against change when the figures have shown that having Clinton on the presidential list â did not significantly improve Obama &apos;s chances of success . â
In an interview with Martin , Des@@ e@@ y confirmed that the administration had indeed envisaged the replacement of B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
&apos;@@ I said that I had looked at a whole series of questions , and that was one of them &apos; , said D@@ e@@ al@@ y in the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that , at that time , the President was not in form , and so we were told , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos;
As Des@@ e@@ y called the &apos; concerted &apos; examination , Martin said to Mr Andersson of C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested a great deal in finding out whether change would be beneficial in the election .
&apos;@@ The campaigns do not devote much money to polls and to discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action &apos; , said Martin on ACTA .
However , it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was looking at replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N that he asked Des@@ e@@ y if his bos@@ s then knew about the possible overhaul .
Although Des@@ e@@ y said he did not think the President was aware of the possible change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was &apos; possible &apos; that Obama knew .
Martin added that &apos; D@@ ouble D@@ ow@@ n &apos; did not give a definitive answer to the question of whether the political polls had reached the Obama office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that B@@ id@@ en &apos;s avo@@ idance of B@@ id@@ en was examined .
&apos;@@ Perhaps &apos; answered Martin .
Do you want a flu@@ o ice ?
A British entreprene@@ ur created the first flu@@ or@@ es@@ tic@@ e ice in the world .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has taken advantage of the flu@@ or@@ inated properties of this marine animal to develop a lu@@ ke@@ warm col@@ lu@@ sion .
He had the idea after reading a study on the mis@@ ses and persuaded Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate the brilliant protein .
The ice cre@@ am is reacting with language by increasing the p@@ H of protein to make it brilliant .
Ch@@ ris explains that , since the ice cre@@ am is beginning to read when it is reacting to the heat of the m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece , the more it is left out , the more brilliant it becomes .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the &apos; L@@ ick M@@ e I@@ m De@@ li@@ ci@@ us &apos; company , said : &apos; It is something un@@ believ@@ able , but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of that tru@@ c costs around 200 billion . &apos;
The protein we use in the ice re@@ acts with a neutral language .
So when your m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece warm protein , the level of p@@ H is rising and the ice is b@@ lowing .
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all of us at the time of H@@ all@@ we@@ en because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice I have created , because the sl@@ ump of the me@@ du@@ s is worth four times more than gold .
Every but@@ le costs me about GBP 140 .
But it is rather good !
The company &apos;s experimental approach to Char@@ lie , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual ice fra@@ gr@@ ances , such as beer , che@@ ese , beef and the gold lea@@ f .
But its next creation is even more ambitious .
He added : &apos; I would really like to develop an in@@ visible ice . &apos;
This is intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the split caused by the ice cr@@ acks that are the cre@@ am , but I think I will find a way of doing that .
The ice uses the flu@@ or@@ inated properties of the syn@@ the@@ tics syn@@ the@@ zed by Chinese scientists .
L@@ ou Re@@ ed died during a ta@@ i
The s@@ ong@@ er L@@ ou Re@@ ed died when he was running a co@@ i exercise , revealed on Thursday his wife L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son in a letter published by the Regional newspaper &apos; E@@ ast@@ t Ham@@ p@@ ton Sta@@ r &apos; and intended for the inhabitants of the city of S@@ pre@@ ings , where the couple had a house .
The arti@@ st died last Sunday , at the age of 71 .
&apos;@@ He died on Sunday morning , when he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st Sh@@ i &apos;@@ i movement , with his hands of mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an who f@@ oured the air &apos; , wrote L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son .
L@@ ou Re@@ ed was master , a Chinese mar@@ tial art .
The sing@@ er &apos;s wife also explains that she promised her hus@@ band , the week before her death , to get him out of the hospital and to take it to the house of S@@ pr@@ lings ( L@@ ong Is@@ land ) .
L@@ ou and I spent a lot of time here in recent years .
And even if we are c@@ it@@ r@@ ats , it is our spiritual house .
&apos;@@ L@@ ou was a pr@@ ince and a combat@@ ant , and I know that his s@@ ong@@ s about the pain and beau@@ ty of the world will pass on to many people the great joy of life that he had &apos; .
L@@ ou Re@@ ed last May suffered a li@@ ver trans@@ plant .
H@@ all@@ we@@ ed in 2013 :
When I was a little , H@@ all@@ we@@ en was magic .
My s@@ ister and I were allowed to eat bon@@ uses , go late and disgu@@ ise us to go to the neighbourhood .
Today , I have become more p@@ ink .
Over the last two years , I have not distributed a single bon@@ us and I will certainly not do so this year .
But the stat@@ utes show that I am a black sheep when we talk about H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
The majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celebrating H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en this year , spending a total of 6.@@ 9 M@@ dollars on bon@@ uses , co@@ ver@@ t and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to the National Re@@ al Rec@@ ord .
What I look forward to with every celebration in H@@ all@@ we@@ en is the trends .
F@@ loo@@ ds should represent USD 1.2 million over the 6.@@ 9 billion spent on the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , un@@ anim@@ ated objects are fur@@ thering .
Women no longer need to be sex@@ y professionals ; they can also be sex@@ y foods like p@@ iz@@ z@@ as , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As far as men are concerned , I expect to see many z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , thanks to the television series The Wal@@ king De@@ ad , and I be@@ t that the men of the space of D@@ a@@ ft P@@ un@@ k will be among our photo@@ graph@@ s In@@ st@@ as@@ gra@@ m this year .
According to Google , the most sought disgu@@ ises are the z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates and sor@@ ce@@ ers .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my surprise , they were not the only ones .
In fact , the Americans will spend USD 3@@ 30 in disgu@@ ise this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
It has made many strange dogs disgu@@ ised in h@@ ot@@ dog@@ as .
When it comes to bon@@ uses , we are not sli@@ pping .
The Americans will spend USD 1.@@ 9 on good this year , according to the Ni@@ el@@ sen cabinet .
This represents around 27@@ 2 million k@@ g of H@@ ec@@ ey , succ@@ inc@@ t , Mil@@ k Du@@ ods , T@@ wi@@ z@@ l@@ ers and C@@ lar@@ k .
It is a super-@@ news for the 41 million children who go to the bon@@ uses in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Trade .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not say , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate in H@@ all@@ al@@ we@@ en .
Good maize is the only thing we do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million k@@ g are sold for H@@ all@@ we@@ en , according to the National Con@@ f@@ tici@@ on@@ ers Association .
This represents around 9 billion grain grain grain .
It is a myster@@ y that I have not yet been able to evade .
Nothing is more representative of H@@ all@@ we@@ l@@ en than the H@@ ann@@ ed houses .
They have the best names , such as &apos; Ter@@ ro@@ r Be@@ h@@ in@@ d the Wel@@ s &apos; ( which is actually a real prison ) , &apos; H@@ ow@@ l-@@ O@@ -@@ S@@ ce@@ am &apos; and &apos; The H@@ ou@@ se of Sha@@ ck &apos; .
In fact , there are 1 200 registered houses officially recognised in the United States , which generate around USD 500 million in revenue , according to the US High Representative , and this includes these wonderful photo@@ graph@@ s of you to p@@ ump you above your friends on Fac@@ e@@ book , and you cannot take away and on which you like a com@@ mentary of a &apos; go@@ ose head &apos; .
Finally , let us talk about c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls .
Char@@ lie Brown presented us with the G@@ ro@@ se Ci@@ utr@@ ille when you were g@@ ang , and s@@ cul@@ p@@ ting a c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine in the form of lan@@ dings , it is like dec@@ ei@@ ving a Christmas tre@@ e - that is something that has been done since we are very small .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for us , the &apos; y@@ aw@@ -@@ c@@ id &apos; trend began only last year thanks to P@@ inter@@ est , so most of us s@@ cul@@ ed these po@@ les and did not have to sit down .
This year , the Americans will spend around USD 10@@ 6 million on c@@ ic@@ ks , according to the U@@ .@@ S@@ .
The sh@@ ell@@ s that are d@@ wind@@ ling on the do@@ ck of your house probably came from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 5@@ 42 million ic@@ ks were grown this year .
If you seek to point out to you more , you call Ti@@ m and Su@@ us@@ an M@@ ath@@ is@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , California , and try to s@@ cul@@ p@@ per their c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls from 9@@ 22 k@@ g .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland will internally create a structure of de@@ fi@@ ance ( &apos; ba@@ ad ban@@ k &apos; ) amounting to GBP 38 billion ( EUR 45 billion ) of the most risky assets , a measure that is designed to rela@@ x its relations with London and accelerate its privatisation .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55 % to 70 % in the next two years and hopes to clean up it completely within three years .
R@@ B@@ S also said that it would include a vision for depreci@@ ating the additional dubious debt of four to Â£ 4@@ .5 billion in the quarter , a writing linked to the formation of the can@@ ning structure .
R@@ B@@ S also made it clear that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion capital books , thus strengthening its ability to lend .
The bank and London have pointed out that the &apos; bad ban@@ k &apos; would be able to draw a line in the past , with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of R@@ B@@ S .
&apos;@@ We can now move forward , concern ourselves with the future and 90 % of the assets that are a truly good bank and build a large bank for customers and for the United Kingdom &apos; , said the new Director-General Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ ow@@ a to the press .
L@@ and R@@ over
Inter@@ n@@ ally , there are only 6 points in the internal system and there is an Inter@@ co@@ m system .
Among the options , such as improved bra@@ kes , a service that gives access to Bow@@ ler Wor@@ ks &apos; mechan@@ ics , logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events .
D@@ re@@ w Bow@@ ler , the Director-General of Bow@@ ler M@@ ot@@ or@@ port said : &apos; The am@@ ate@@ ur am@@ ate@@ urs who join Bow@@ ler have changed . &apos;
They are not all experienced , some are seeking exc@@ itement and ad@@ venture and realistic access to international events .
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with L@@ and R@@ over and the M@@ SA , and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to try different forms of cr@@ acks in the United Kingdom and the international world , and to prepare for the shores and realities of the ra@@ ids .
We had a great deal of pleasure in developing the D@@ ef@@ der Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge vehicle - the cham@@ pion@@ ship is going to be pal@@ p@@ able .
In addition , Dr Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deser@@ ts of North Africa and the Middle East .

A chi@@ ot had the chance to get out of the worst after the fire bri@@ g@@ ades were called to recover safely when it was lost at 15 m above the soil on the unstable season of a c@@ lif@@ f .
Ru@@ by , a co@@ ck@@ y of 9 months , escap@@ ed after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days only before being res@@ cu@@ ed in a career on Wednesday .
His owners , Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years , and his little friend Bec@@ ke@@ y H@@ all , 20 years ago , went to the career of F@@ l@@ Ã©@@ l@@ ille in D@@ gen@@ ol@@ me in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to find R@@ Ã©@@ by and than@@ ked West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
They had desperately sought their lost chi@@ p and launched an appeal on social networks after it disappeared into a career following an un@@ serious accident .
T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ .@@ 15 on Wednesday , a person with a strong view who promoted his dog took Ru@@ by on a cor@@ n@@ che in the career , co@@ in@@ ed at 15 m above the soil .
A technical rescue team of the C@@ lar@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fire bri@@ g@@ ade has been ru@@ ined in the places and has gone down in order to save R@@ by by using a animal civic to transport it to the top of the c@@ lif@@ f .
The expert expert An@@ y C@@ la@@ y@@ ton said : &apos; She was in a precarious situation . &apos;
She was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , at 15 m of the summit and 15 m .
It did not bud@@ ge at all during the rescue - it was frozen .
But it is going well now .
She has e@@ aten b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
It was a very unusual appeal .
It is incredible that someone noticed the dog .
The technical assistance expert Peter L@@ u said : &apos; R@@ by has had a great deal of opportunity to get out of it un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed &apos; .
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was conducted in the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for control ; his general state was satisfactory , apart from exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
M@@ iss H@@ all , H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : &apos; I was terri@@ fied by observing the aid &apos; .
First of all , I did not believe that it was there .
It was surprising to have it again .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian has said that if it had been too exhausted and ev@@ aded , it would probably have fallen .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ades were wrec@@ ked .
What they have done was really courageous .
They are so grateful , each has been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ ei@@ gh@@ ley , added : &apos; You were afraid that it was falling but it did not move . &apos;
The fire bri@@ g@@ ades were supposed .
I cannot believe that it was there .

Beijing is challenging an Islamic Islamic movement
&apos;@@ Support behind the attack has come from the Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan Movement based in Central and Western Asia &apos; , declared the bos@@ s of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television channel , according to a video online on Thursday evening on a website .
Men@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party Party ( CC@@ P ) , was speaking in T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent on an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time that a Chinese official has appointed a particular organisation after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three U@@ igh@@ urs of the same family in the Muslim dominant region of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , a border of several Central Asian countries , preci@@ pit@@ ated their car with petrol against the entry of the City banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that claimed two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and mother died in the car fire .
The E@@ ti@@ m , which dec@@ la@@ res to fight for the independence of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan , a former name of Chinese X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , was ran@@ ked by the UN in 2002 among aff@@ ili@@ ated al-@@ Qaeda organisations .
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic unrest in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George K@@ er@@ ev@@ an : Europe &apos;s break@@ -up gives the S@@ co@@ ts a choice
Another day , another worrying history of independence .
This time we are warning that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU .
Now we hear stories of passport control in Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed border of wi@@ re wi@@ re along the H@@ ad@@ u@@ n wall .
It is true that the newspaper in Stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ d has indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , but it was not in the headlines ( and that was to be predicted ) .
Nobody has said that the EU Member States devote much of their time to circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , a continuous breach of the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything that it wants to obtain from S@@ co@@ ts .
So it is a story that is not one .
And a history that is so old that it is now fixed : I have heard for the first time the br@@ ass that &apos; independence means passport control &apos; more than 40 years ago .
However , an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of an old d@@ ust tal@@ e .
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe , in fact ?
Why exchange the y@@ o@@ ke of London against Brussels , especially now ?
This is the real news about Europe : the great post-war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is finally dead .
With the euro crisis , the Europe Pro@@ ject is officially dead .
Throughout Europe , the parties that oppose the EU or are fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Al@@ ter@@ native Al@@ ter@@ native Party for Germany , founded only this year and arrived from nowhere , brought together almost five million votes in the September federal elections and came out of the Liberal Democratic Party ( the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the B@@ unde@@ sta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , together with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket on national economies through accession to the single currency , has led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits - that was only true of Greece .
Instead , the European system has put its members of exchange rates favourable to German exporters - what German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the countries of southern Europe have an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem vis-Ã -vis Germany .
The only use is to make cuts in wages and public spending - promoted by Berlin .
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper mal@@ a@@ ise linked to productivity in Europe .
Following the &apos; green &apos; energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason to subsid@@ ise French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States .
This is an in@@ hi@@ b@@ iting disadvantage in terms of costs , as we have already seen in Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ outh .
Not all wage managers in the world will prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being penalised by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the grey revol@@ t , particularly in France , is one of the EU &apos;s great leaders .
After the war , the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and bringing Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy to get off the ground .
As a result , the extreme right-wing party of Mari@@ ne Le Pen , the National Front National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , leaving the socialists to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically encourage the left .
What is Mari@@ ne Le Pen doing with her new popularity in the French white working class ?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single , anti-@@ European , anti-@@ European and anti-@@ European bloc in the European Parliament .
If the anti-@@ European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , the anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will come back to something that will look more like &apos; the Europe of the Nations ( sovereign ) &apos; , which General de Gaul@@ le has preferred .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency .
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project , and I hope that it will give the United States a soft eyes .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending out Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could live with a fre@@ er European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries similar to similar views would be easier in a Europe of non-@@ federal Nations .
Otherwise , we should im@@ it@@ ate Norway and retain our economic independence .
The S@@ N@@ P government of Scotland is - and this is to be noted - the anti-@@ austerity political movement that has been the most successful in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 , based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by Chancellor of the Labour ch@@ ess@@ er , Al@@ lis@@ ir Dar@@ ling , and the Conservative / Liberal Democrats that followed .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
Ear@@ lier :
Stu@@ dies show that young Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach the age of the pen@@ insula earlier than white girls .
P@@ rac@@ tical changes do not mean that the pu@@ ber@@ ty is imminent .
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible for that .
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be a trigger of early pun@@ ish@@ ments .
The trend towards early pun@@ ish@@ ments is not as pronounced in boys as boys .
The former correspon@@ dent of C@@ N@@ N P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a specialist journalist in family and health issues in the child .
Does a mother have to worry if his daughter &apos;s se@@ als and po@@ ols are starting to grow to 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ s held this week in Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Dr Paul K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ists , explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American people and represent a new standard .
&apos;@@ I take a long time to reassure parents - in general , that does not indicate a rapid change to the full pun@@ ch &apos; .
The obvious signs of development , such as the qu@@ ag@@ mire of se@@ ins , po@@ les under arms and the pu@@ bi@@ al area and body o@@ ths , appear earlier in girls .
But there was only a slight advance of the age of the first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , while it was 12 years in 1970 .
&apos;@@ Once the ch@@ est has begun to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear &apos; , he said K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of the &apos; El@@ ly P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ ls &apos; : The Es@@ s@@ enti@@ al Gu@@ i@@ de to C@@ op@@ ing .
Time is the most precise test of how the chi@@ p is going .
There is a debate about what is the real appearance of the chi@@ p , but it is regarded as &apos; early &apos; when the development of the ch@@ est is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows down or stops - that is something that a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can follow closely .
More rapid development can justify tests carried out by en@@ do@@ in@@ olog@@ ists to remove serious problems such as tu@@ m@@ ours or k@@ y@@ sts .
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : premature ageing of the os that can curb growth and a small amount of ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
recommendations for medicinal and h@@ orm@@ one treatment are based on the age of the child , the development rate , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
The psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z is cautious with medicines but recognises that &apos; control of the pu@@ ber@@ ty can alleviate some of the problems of behaviour and sen@@ s@@ ation for young girls to be different from others &apos; .
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
&apos;@@ They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they are going to manage hygiene issues &apos; , said K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
&apos;@@ It was a shock &apos; , remember a woman whose daughter had its first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , it was not prepared emo@@ tionally .
She returned from the frigh@@ tened and sha@@ ky school to be the first among her friends .
There are many the@@ ories to public knowledge about the causes of the early warning .
However , there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible .
boys , like girls , reach their pun@@ ish@@ ments earlier .
K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z says that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He took part in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9 , which links the percentage of fat mass to the outbreak .
Other disco@@ veries support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , young Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the pen@@ sion@@ er age earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
At a global level , the early warning mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything , economic conditions in the climate and genes .
Another problem is that , although boys have po@@ les on the face and in the younger pu@@ bi@@ e area , the trend towards real early pub@@ s is not as pronounced as girls .
Other doctors involved in the A@@ P@@ P Conference stressed the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ac@@ id and po@@ le po@@ les is common , even in inf@@ ants and small .
&apos;@@ We need to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of the pu@@ ber@@ ty &apos; , said Dr L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a child of en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist working in the hospital for children Gor@@ y@@ e@@ b in Mor@@ ris@@ to@@ own , in the New Jer@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents should not hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ s to know how to speak with their children .
&apos;@@ This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than planned &apos; , explained K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
If you remain calm , your child will respond in general .
The d@@ augh@@ ters of early care must be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected , the process is part of life .

If L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is did not exist , the two f@@ ans of mad music built their history on real person@@ alities like the mad mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an D@@ ae V@@ on R@@ on@@ k .
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Green@@ wi@@ ch village , this New York headquarters called &apos; the ep@@ ic@@ entre of the rise of mad music that would lead to international st@@ ars &apos; , as the journalist E@@ li@@ j@@ h Wal@@ d , a friend of van R@@ on@@ k , wrote .

The magic of the Co@@ -@@ Cha@@ en bro@@ thers is still operating by including a fun@@ g@@ le who is going through the film on a permanent basis : a wonderful c@@ at in the eyes of L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is .

In February , the New York Times devoted it as &apos; the no@@ se bro@@ ther who knew too much &apos; .
It then took ten days in Afghanistan , the theat@@ re of 19@@ 8 and 1994 , which was the famous series of sp@@ ying no@@ vel@@ s .
O@@ ut physically , by a very serious car@@ di@@ a@@ c accident in December 2010 , he was travelling on this journey with a am@@ bul@@ ance .
And before Afghanistan , it was also party to Libya , Russia , Lebanon and Mal@@ i .
With four SA@@ S published a year , G@@ Ã©r@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , born on 8 December 19@@ 29 in Paris , ignored the exact number of books sold since 196@@ 5 and the publication of &apos; SA@@ S in Istanbul &apos; , the first of the series , almost half a century ago .
&apos;@@ Un@@ doub@@ tedly between 120 and 150 million of all countries , &apos; he said last March .

F@@ loo@@ kers are struggling with the wid@@ th of seats when large orders are at stake at stake .
The dispute is ra@@ ging between the large aviation companies about the wid@@ th of the tourist class seats on long-@@ running flights , pa@@ ving the way for a bitter confrontation in the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical Sal@@ on which is taking place in the month .
The conflict relates to the wid@@ th of the seats proposed on long-@@ run flights to passengers in the economic class - which are not always the most crow@@ ned by the airlines , but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the last devices presented by Airbus SA@@ S and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard of at least 18 h@@ ens ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Bo@@ eing says that it should be up to the airlines to decide .
The dispute broke out when the gre@@ ers were seeking to sell even bigger versions of their long-@@ running long-@@ run aircraft , hoping perhaps for a record record in the event of 17 to 21 November .
The way in which the seats will go down the plane - in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats head@@ -on - is essential for the economic performance of the &apos; min@@ i tw@@ in &apos; seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says that the re@@ designed 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X will be able to host 40@@ 6 people in seats of more than 17 h@@ ens and will be confi@@ gu@@ red with 10 seats .
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A@@ 350 will carry 350 people in an economic class in seats of 18 h@@ ens in the middle of 9 .
The gi@@ ants of aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics often trade in technical matters by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus is directly appealing to the public before the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical Sal@@ on , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We have seen recently what might be the start of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a photo@@ grap@@ h showing three people against one another in the restaur@@ ant , entitled &apos; would you accept that ? &apos;
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ run flights in smaller seats than in regional tur@@ bo@@ pro@@ pe@@ l@@ s@@ ers &apos; , indicated John Le@@ ah@@ y , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people are growing , but the seats in aircraft have not changed radically .
Between the beginning of the 1970s , when the tw@@ in 7@@ 47 of Bo@@ eing defined the modern long-@@ distance journey , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .
The average turn of the average American in the 21st century is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 h@@ ens , according to US health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival is cl@@ inging to a concept of sie@@ ge that dates back to the 195@@ 0s , when the f@@ res@@ h@@ -@@ j@@ et package was closer .
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional boost to the wid@@ th of seats would improve the quality of the sle@@ ep of 53 % .
Bo@@ eing the Airbus figures in relation to the wid@@ th of seats and says that it is not for manufacturers to decide how the airlines are balancing the price of tickets and equipment .
He also says that the study shows that in cab@@ in experience depends not only on the wid@@ th of seats .
&apos;@@ It is really a matter of providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , said K@@ ent C@@ ass@@ er , who is responsible for the passengers &apos; satisfaction at Bo@@ eing .
They do not want to be told what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more about having a certain freedom of movement , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute is a race for aircraft for an estimated amount of at least USD 700 M@@ dollars at the price of the market in decades to come , enough to look at the balance of US and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters said for the first time in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last appli@@ ances .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing are both in favour of a return per seat in their latest models of long-@@ run long-@@ running b@@ im@@ ers than the market leader in this seg@@ ment , the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ ER of 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing is partly dependent on the comparison between 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 seats per row and a model 7@@ 77 of the origin of 9 .
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared with the de@@ vice that has been confi@@ gu@@ red with 10 seats currently in service .
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing is doing that in order to be able to ca@@ p more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products &apos; , said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ is@@ on , Director of Con@@ strong P@@ ass@@ er in the European poultry carrier .
On the other hand , the analy@@ sts say that cab@@ in boo@@ ths with 10 seats per row in the existing 7@@ 77 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs .
&apos;@@ An 18@@ -@@ b@@ n seat is perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 &apos; , has declared the internal expertise of the D@@ y Kir@@ by , foun@@ der and ed@@ itor of R@@ un@@ w@@ ay G@@ ir@@ l Network .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers , including airlines .
Air@@ craft ven@@ d@@ ors who go around the world even take a me@@ tre to check the competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While selling itself to offer comfortable appli@@ ances , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high den@@ sity confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations to low-cost airlines and regional tri@@ ps .
Airbus provides an A@@ 350 confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation with 10 seats , but says that it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus highlighted the need for greater person@@ alization of cab@@ ins by offering larger seats to some of its aircraft .
Without the support of the only other large manufacturers of modern appli@@ ances , the experts say that it is unlikely that its call for the aviation industry to put in place a high standard for the seats will be successful , but that it could make the sales wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X forget .
The shareholders of O@@ r@@ ir@@ a
A majority of the company &apos;s shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the foun@@ der and Director-General Lar@@ ry E@@ l@@ ison , in view of the financial performance of his group .
The vote is not binding , but it is a te@@ sta@@ ment to the image of Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , a third global fortune , just as a result of the victory of its boat in the American Cup .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire still holds 25 % of the capital of the software group that he co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
As long ago as last year , E@@ l@@ ison had a negative vote on its remuneration .
The O@@ ra@@ le bos@@ s gave up a bon@@ us of USD 1.2 million for the 2013 financial year closed in May because of the poor performance of the group , which has missed its growth targets , but it has seen around USD 77 million in store .
Its fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar .
On the whole period of 2013 , the net benefit of the O@@ ra@@ le has grown by 3.5 % , while the stock market price of 27@@ .5 % , which is over@@ performing the S &amp; P 500 index , has taken 24 % at the same time .
The new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking .
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine which could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
A single do@@ se of the vaccine has been able to protect the m@@ ouse of dependence on nic@@ ot@@ ine .
Other tests are needed before we start tests on human beings , but Professor R@@ on@@ ald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of the We@@ ill Med@@ ical College in New York said that the first signs were encouraging .
&apos;@@ We really hope that this kind of vacc@@ in@@ al strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , using all the methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches &apos; , said Professor Cor@@ n@@ ell .
The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been amended to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus is selec@@ tively infec@@ ting the li@@ ver cells , which is then starting to produce a regular stream of anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies are tr@@ acking all the nic@@ ot@@ ine m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules in the blood system and neutr@@ alising them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having his do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
In the tests , the vacc@@ inated m@@ ice to which the nic@@ ot@@ ine was subsequently given was carried out normally .
But the m@@ ouse who had not been vacc@@ inated &apos; were aff@@ lu@@ ent &apos; said the researchers , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
The experiences are described in the jour@@ nal Science Trans@@ Latin Medic@@ ine .
Pre@@ vious vaccines against tobacco have proved to be ineffective because they contain anti@@ bodies .
In@@ jec@@ tions had to be repeated so frequently so that anti@@ bodies remain high that they were too expensive and in@@ convenient .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if the future vaccine for human use were completely safe , it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nic@@ ot@@ ine .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
&apos;@@ They will know that if they start smoking , they will not take any pleasure in the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and that can help them to lose their bad habit &apos; .
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have pointed out that much more in-depth research is needed .
Pakistani Taliban leader
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south , was killed in an American dr@@ one on Friday in Pakistan , has been learned from the security services .
H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south &apos;s death has been announced several times in the past .

Tri@@ po@@ di
The former Labour Minister of New Wales of the South Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be investigated by the state &apos;s anti-@@ corruption regulator .
Former Minister of New Wales of the South Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di has denied that he has changed trade policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three items in the government controlled .
On Friday , the Independent Committee on the Ag@@ ain@@ t Cor@@ ruption ( CC@@ C ) broad@@ ened its investigation into whether Mr O@@ be@@ id had put pressure on several state ministers to renew his b@@ alls in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar four , where the O@@ be@@ mi@@ d had two restaur@@ ants and a coffee after their expiry in August 2005 , without any invitation to tender .
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tri@@ po@@ di was aware of Mr O@@ be@@ id &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ po@@ le , on Thursday .
In the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government pressed for the b@@ ones to be called for .
The ten@@ ants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , the b@@ ars concerning C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar four companies , which related to the O@@ be@@ mi@@ ds about 2.5 M@@ dollars per year , were renewed without any invitation to tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was Minister of Por@@ ts from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of ten@@ ders .
But he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr O@@ be@@ id , who acknowledged Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , calling for a change in government policy .
The trans@@ cri@@ ption of telephone convers@@ ations presented to ICA@@ C showed appeals in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who came to the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of Mr O@@ be@@ id in the Ministry of Fisheries .
&apos;@@ The subject under discussion during these telephone convers@@ ations was the development of trade policy policy &apos; .
&apos;@@ No &apos; , responded to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
I do not remember what we have discussed but , in any case , it was not .
In any case , certainly not between me and Mr O@@ be@@ id .
Israeli war@@ planes targeting Syria , declaring a responsible person responsible
Israeli war@@ planes have reached a target in the Syrian port city in La@@ ta@@ k@@ ia on Thursday evening , confirming a military officer in Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The person responsible did not specify what the target was , but said that there was at least one .
The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 .
At least twice this year , Israel has carried out air strikes against missile car@@ goes in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa may have a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test .
The government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test for foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa when it envisages extending the repressive measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion to prevent visas from 4@@ 57 to be used to occupy un@@ skilled posts or as a back door to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A working paper of the government was un@@ ve@@ iled today , while the Labour MEP Mu@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w was denoun@@ cing the government speech on foreign workers , saying that it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbours .
&apos;@@ S@@ mar@@ c@@ ant statements on &apos; foreigners returning to the end of the qu@@ e@@ ue &apos; and &apos; jobs for the Austr@@ ali@@ ans first &apos; are a unpleasant return when the trade unions called for a protected labour market , and told the Austr@@ ali@@ an Indian Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , this meant that the work of the White Paper was to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historic ar@@ ten@@ t .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by the former Minister for Immigration Ch@@ ris Bow@@ en .
The Minister of Immigration B@@ ren@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being under consideration .
If the &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; criterion was adopted , a visa see@@ ker could be controlled to know &apos; if the offer of employment is auth@@ enti@@ c in the case of the candidate being a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person in the company who spons@@ ors it &apos; .
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 4@@ 57 , after some of them , having intended to spons@@ or a small number of workers , actually used hundreds of them .
Meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old Sri Lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker would have died of a heart crisis after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers on the island of Chris@@ t@@ mas this week .
The star@@ ving son of man , aged 9 , went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ated c@@ ous@@ in that was also on board .
man was urgently transferred by the Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities to the hospital in the island of Chris@@ t@@ mas , where he died .
A study to increase the benefits of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work carried out by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of Ph@@ 1 1 in 20@@ 26 .
The Transport Minister bar@@ red K@@ ram@@ er said that the project would bring together the United Kingdom .
The Scottish Transport Minister , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown , said &apos; exc@@ ited &apos; to the idea of working with the British Government on the project .
Ph@@ as@@ se 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When PHARE 2 is completed , the lines will serve Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from GBP 3@@ 2.@@ 7 to 4@@ 2.@@ 6 .
The British Government , which is in talks with S@@ co@@ t@@ land , asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of the journey for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travel times between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh of three hours .
Baroness K@@ ram@@ er said : &apos; Our objective for H@@ S@@ 2 is about a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together . &apos;
We are pushing the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the advantages it presents are enormous .
Without him , we are faced with a problem with our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connec@@ tivity between the 18 large British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ lis@@ ta@@ r Car@@ m@@ cha@@ el , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland &apos; .
In the case of the Scottish Government , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown called on Mr Car@@ em@@ ic@@ el to unequivocally support the inclusion of Scotland in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &apos; high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland to the overall high-speed rail network across Britain .
&apos; We are therefore exc@@ ited about working in partnership with the British Government to examine the options for bringing the high-speed rail network to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and supple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
&apos;@@ I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps . &apos;
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia at the moment .
Austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers will have to continue to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their t@@ ab@@ lets and s@@ mar@@ ph@@ ons during take@@ -@@ off and landing despite the US gesture to rela@@ x the regulation of electronic devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to US carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch vide@@ os or play games on their appli@@ ances during critical flight phases , provided that they are &apos; aircraft &apos; .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do this during the largest part of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Austr@@ ali@@ an ha@@ uli@@ ers are examining the decision that obliges US carriers to carry out an important job in order to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Aviation Authority has also stated that it is examining the announcement but has pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia .
&apos;@@ The CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft &apos; .
The issue is the subject of a regulation that obliges aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained permanently and passengers comply with the safety requirements of crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , which has already spoken to CA@@ SA about its intention to extend the use of its enter@@ tainment system on board W@@ i F@@ i , was open to change , but said it would follow the regulator .
&apos;@@ We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA which would allow the use of electronic devices because we really do believe that this would improve the customer &apos;s experience now that we have - the on-@@ board enter@@ tainment system using W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology on our aeroplan@@ es &apos; .
Q@@ ut@@ t@@ as said that the current rules were respected at the moment .
&apos;@@ In line with our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we do not intend to change that immediately , but has said .
The FA@@ A decision applies to US airlines .
However , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For US carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as review tex@@ t@@ books , training equipment , the transport of hand b@@ agg@@ age and the instructions provided to passengers .
&apos;@@ As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use ligh@@ tw@@ eight electronic devices , such as t@@ ab@@ lets , electronic p@@ ounds and s@@ mar@@ ph@@ ph@@ es to all al@@ abilities &apos; , has declared the FA@@ A .
In the few cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their equipment during the landing .
The group has also recommended that heavi@@ er appli@@ ances be placed safely under the seats or in higher compar@@ tments during take@@ -@@ off and landing .

Cred@@ it l@@ enders
A len@@ der of the B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er commercial centre in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani A@@ mir@@ th@@ ing@@ a is putting a bra@@ ke , a jo@@ ke and a p@@ ack of gold but@@ t@@ les to pay the school fees of his d@@ augh@@ ters .
&apos;@@ My hus@@ band and I have just bought a house , so my money is party &apos; , says Mrs A@@ mir@@ th@@ al@@ a .
Although it ear@@ ns USD 3 000 ( $ 2 400 ) per month as a driver and her hus@@ band is also working , the monthly family income is not enough .
In fact , demand is such in parts of South-East Asia - where household debt is rising - that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , where she has carried out her transaction , has become the third loan loan company to be introduced on the Singapore market this week .
P@@ utting together b@@ ick@@ ers is not just a quick way to obtain cash money - $ 1 300 in Singapore in the case of Ms A@@ mir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a - but it is almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
In general , the loan l@@ enders from Singapore raise an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by the United O@@ ver@@ se@@ as Bank , a local fund provider with a branches in the same commercial centre .
However , credit l@@ enders have the advantage of not asking for cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or wage proof , and can release loans faster than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region are turning to the l@@ enders , while families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by a monetary policy that is too lax in advanced economies , low-@@ income and middle-@@ income families are turning to lending l@@ enders to bridge the difference when their economies are slowing down .
This week , the Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ or@@ se rating agency cited the growing household debt , resulting mainly from the rise in mortgages , as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt ratio of the highest gross domestic product / GDP in Asia .
Malaysia comes at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , whereas the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has recently emerged from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
The balance sheet is that , with the rise in costs , people in the middle or the bottom are seeking to supplement their income as they can , dec@@ la@@ res S@@ ong S@@ en@@ g W@@ n , an economist at IC@@ M@@ B , a Malay@@ sian bank .
The historically high gold prices over the last two years have meant that people have been quick to bring their personal effects to bear in order to affect the value of their je@@ wel@@ s .
In Singapore , around 70 % of the articles put in place in the 200 shops on the basis of the cement state are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us bring the gold chain to a grand@@ mother and we will be looking for it next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest loan operator , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using their shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the loan sector that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , the B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er operator and 15 other shops like the one in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where there are already four shops - but also outside Asia , dec@@ la@@ res Y@@ e@@ ah Le@@ e King , the Director-General .
The company will finance them by using 60 % of the USD 66 in Singapore that it rose this week when it was introduced on the Singapore grant .
While some of the low interest l@@ enders have suffered criticism of the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates that they practise , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah indicates that the up@@ bringing is not only lower rates than other l@@ enders , but that , in addition , it does not directly increase the debt .
The customers are selling goods that they already have , and mone@@ tiz@@ ing their personal goods does not increase household debt .
It is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term .
The people who go to l@@ enders are not just those who have financial problems .
The well-@@ off people of Singapore are also going in the loan shops on V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x to bring in gold le@@ ing@@ ers or Ro@@ le@@ x mon@@ sters , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase prices in cash .
We see customers from all sections of society .
&apos;@@ It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial or investment activities , or small businesses that have cash needs to go a difficult course &apos; , adding M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need money very quickly .

A rescue plan of USD 3@@ 25 for the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia health system
The Federal Government maintains that the rescue plan of USD 3@@ 25 for the v@@ ile health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the government government will not waste the funds .
The Federal Health Minister T@@ an@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is currently taking urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic disease and the constraints of the system .
The funding , planned for four years , was decided after the government consultations with the independent Member of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia , An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&apos;@@ The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which , in our opinion , will resolve the unique difficulties that the State is facing &apos; , said Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
The $ 3@@ 25 $ 3@@ 25 plan includes a campaign of 31 M@@ F@@ A for non-@@ urgent sur@@ gical operations .
There are 2 600 additional operations , particularly in the area of or@@ th@@ or@@ ic sur@@ ger@@ y and the cat@@ ar@@ taking , which will help catch up .
Funds are also provided for clin@@ ics without meetings in H@@ ob@@ art and L@@ au@@ n@@ c@@ es@@ ton , better external care , training of medical frameworks , health care services and the deployment of electronic medical records in local hospitals .
&apos;@@ These investments respond to the idea that , according to the first-@@ line clin@@ ic@@ ians , it is the best way of treating the health system in T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos; , said Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
The Minister said that the government of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia would be faced with a strict regime for preparing reports and reporting .
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it is spending additional funds .
A committee of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides the services as efficiently and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie has said today that the USD 3@@ 25 will not count for very much &apos; unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate the public health system in T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos; .
However , he congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance that he presented to Prime Minister early May .
&apos;@@ I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to removing the public health system from the black@@ list &apos; , said Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie .
According to the state government , these non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
However , the opposition spokes@@ person for the health opposition Peter D@@ ut@@ ton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a &apos; fortune solution &apos; .
&apos;@@ The reason why we are here is that the State Labour Government has withdrawn USD 4@@ 30 from its health system &apos; , he said on A@@ BC TV .
We cannot have a government of the state that is gr@@ ub@@ bing up almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth that puts USD 300 , and pretend that it is a good day .
Mr Du@@ t@@ ton visited Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , dec@@ la@@ res the supervisory body .
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas muni@@ tions , declared the international monitoring body for chemical weapons on Thursday , when violent clashes were ra@@ ging in the north of the country , near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian milit@@ ants also said on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago .
The announcement of the Organisation for the prohibition of Ch@@ em@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons ( O@@ I@@ C ) came to an end in advance on the deadline of the deadline of the end of the day .
1 November set by the organization based in The Hague ordered Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &apos; make &apos; all chemical weapons production units and machinery designed to mi@@ grate toxic gases and to fill muni@@ tions .
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Dam@@ as@@ cus chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014 .
With the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
It is believed that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the s@@ ar@@ in neuro@@ toxic agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was ra@@ ging on Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fi@@ ra , which , according to the experts , is home to a unit of chemical weapons and storage sites , reported the Syrian Monitoring Centre on Human Rights based in Britain .
The group of activists , which is following the development of the human balance through a network of milit@@ ants based in Syria , said on Thursday that 120 2@@ 96 people were dead .
Among them , there are 61 0@@ 67 civilians , including 6 3@@ 65 children .
On the government side it is estimated that 29 9@@ 54 members of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad &apos;s armed forces have died , 18 6@@ 78 of whom were fighters of pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 Lebanese Hezbollah milit@@ ants .
Of the dead , it is also estimated that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ tors and some 5 3@@ 75 opposition fighters , many of whom were foreign .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since .
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict .
Assad &apos;s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to Al Qaeda groups , in Sa@@ fi@@ ra for weeks .
The Observ@@ atory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but there was no clarification .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsen@@ al in the midst of a civil war that is continuing , within tight deadlines .
A statement by the O@@ I@@ C , which works in close cooperation with the UN , indicated that its team was &apos; now happy to have controlled - and seen destroyed - all the declared critical production and machinery for mi@@ xing and filling &apos; .
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was planned for the moment &apos; .
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety , have indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the ICA@@ O said that the two sites were , according to Syria , &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they were happy with had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the unit of Sa@@ fi@@ ra was one of the two sites that the O@@ I@@ C inspectors were unable to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for full destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved in the month following the I@@ O@@ C Executive Committee .
&apos;@@ I welcome the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organisation &apos; , declared the Director-General of the organisation Ah@@ met U@@ zu@@ c@@ u , in a comment published by the O@@ I@@ C .
Now in its third year , the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels in the al-@@ Assad Government and its security forces , which are supported by members of the A@@ law@@ ite sec@@ t , a branch of Shia Islam .
On the other hand , the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory has said that there has been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of La@@ ta@@ k@@ ia .
The cause of the explosion is unknown .
O@@ cc@@ a@@ sionally caused by the sentence against one of the Bali bom@@ bers
The survi@@ v@@ ors and relatives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence against the last of the con@@ spir@@ ators to be brought to justice , saying that U@@ mar P@@ at@@ k should be sho@@ ed by an ex@@ chequ@@ er .
P@@ at@@ k , who spent almost 10 years on the flight as one of the most sought men in South-East Asia , was yesterday sentenced to a 20@@ -year prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explo@@ si@@ ves used in the attacks .
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
The 4@@ 5-@@ year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two bo@@ xes in the popular tourist district in K@@ ut@@ a , which killed 20@@ 2 people , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and made many injured .
It has also been convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The prosecu@@ tors have asked for a sentence of life imprisonment , yet they could have asked that the man , called &apos; D@@ an M@@ an &apos; for his reputation as an expert on bombs , should be sentenced to death .
The decision has revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Pe@@ ith who lost his two tw@@ in tw@@ ins of 39 years , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction of P@@ at@@ ek and other con@@ spir@@ ators nearly 10 years ago .
On the ver@@ ge of te@@ ars , she said that P@@ at@@ k should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men .
&apos;@@ He should be dra@@ gged in front of the execution &apos; , said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en to the A@@ P@@ P .
I have to live every day without any other grand@@ children or see my daughter .
Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , which was charged in an out@@ -@@ gas band , explo@@ ded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in P@@ ad@@ d@@ do@@ s B@@ ar when a suicide bom@@ ber made a s@@ ack on his do@@ s for explo@@ si@@ ves just 20 seconds earlier .
He s@@ ank in a com@@ a after the attack and remained un@@ conscious for a month , and he is &apos; dead &apos; three times when he was under res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that P@@ at@@ k should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah responsible for car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ l@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a - who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
To keep it alive , why there is no reason to keep it alive .
P@@ assing 20 years in prison after killing 20@@ 2 people and injured hundreds of others is not much .
P@@ ate@@ k is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being cap@@ tured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Ab@@ bot@@ ri@@ d , where US forces will kill the former al-@@ Qaeda leader , Os@@ ama bin Laden , less than four months later .

FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on board aircraft ( but not a call with their mobile phone )
Pass@@ eng@@ ers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices to read , work , play games , watch films and listen to music - but not to talk about their mobile phone - under the new , very expected new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another , declared the adminis@@ tr@@ ator of the FA@@ A Mic@@ hael Hu@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
The airlines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training tex@@ t@@ books of crew members and the rules on the payment of equipment to be in conformity .
The FA@@ A has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ Blue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&apos;@@ depending on the plan , we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon &apos; , indicated the FA@@ A in a statement .
At the moment , passengers have to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other appli@@ ances as soon as the aeroplan@@ es are closed .
They are not supposed to join them before the plane reaches an al@@ titude of 10 000 feet and the comm@@ ander gives the green light .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances when the plane is down before landing and not r@@ all@@ ying it until the plane has been asked .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their appli@@ ances during take@@ -@@ off , landing and rolling on the ground .
Most of the new online aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to higher al@@ titude should meet the criteria .
L@@ ura G@@ l@@ ad@@ ing , Chair of the Association of Pro@@ tec@@ tion@@ al F@@ ail@@ s , has been happy with these changes .
&apos;@@ Once the new policy is implemented safely - and we are going to work closely with the ha@@ uli@@ ers for this - it will benefit everyone &apos; .
We are , frankly , tired of feeling as &apos; super@@ se@@ ds &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet with over@@ f@@ lowing , exchange em@@ ail@@ s and SM@@ S or down@@ loading data below 10 000 feet , has declared the agency .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other aircraft .
So , still not Wor@@ ds W@@ it@@ h Fri@@ ends , the S@@ cru@@ b@@ ble online game that the A@@ le@@ c Bal@@ d@@ w@@ in player was playing on its s@@ mar@@ ph@@ ph@@ one in 2011 when it was de@@ ported to a high noise by an American Air@@ lines plane after refusing to ext@@ ingu@@ ish its apparatus when the apparatus was kept on the door .
And the heavi@@ er appli@@ ances such as port@@ able computers will always have to be con@@ signed because they could hurt someone if they fly through the cab@@ in .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The regulatory power concerning mobile phones belongs to the Commission &apos;s Federal Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Last month , Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of the National Transport Bo@@ ard , the National Transport Safety expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , said that mobile phones were always considered to be a risk .
&apos;@@ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the F@@ CC@@ C , that they could dis@@ rupt the mobile phone networks if they are used on board &apos; , said Ros@@ len@@ ker .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allows for a broader use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has increased in recent years to rela@@ x restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ ator Mc@@ Cas@@ k@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o , argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of appli@@ ances has become om@@ ni@@ present .
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their devices , or do so deliberately .
The FA@@ A started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying F@@ M , the high-tech g@@ ad@@ ge@@ -@@ tech .
New online aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
Air@@ lines allow their passengers to use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to cru@@ ise al@@ abilities for several years .
Gen@@ e@@ tically modified aircraft to host W@@ i F@@ i systems are also better at preventing interference .
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow for a broader use of electronic devices under the new directives .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much weaker power radio trans@@ missions than previous generations .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic books read@@ ers , for example , only issue minimum trans@@ missions when we turn a page .
But the trans@@ missions are stronger when the equipment is down@@ loaded or sending data .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is one of those who press for a rela@@ xation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , the leaders of the company had a online online plane plane , K@@ ind@@ le , to see if there were problems , but there was none .
This has inspired the members of the SA@@ A Advisory Committee on the question of whether or not the use of appli@@ ances is a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ lines P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said that he thought that interference from appli@@ ances was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee have said that there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots indicating that appli@@ ances can interfere with aircraft systems , and that most of them are very old .
However , the committee has recommended that the FA@@ A should allow pil@@ ots to ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their equipment during the landing to the instruments under low visibility conditions .
A group of the travel industry was pleased with the changes , calling for sensible arrangements for travellers with technology .
&apos;@@ We are pleased that the FA@@ A recognises that a passenger experiment is not incompatible with security &apos; , declared Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , President and Director of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tra@@ vel Association .
A Se@@ e@@ ked bir@@ d of a North Sea platform
A bir@@ d , be@@ le@@ agu@@ ered after having been found on an oil platform in the North Sea , was released in nature .
The water was raised on board a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter to A@@ ber@@ de@@ en last month before it was handed over by the Scottish S@@ CI@@ P in its V@@ all@@ a rescue centre .
The director of the centre , Col@@ in S@@ ed@@ don , said : &apos; This water water was probably a cha@@ ver@@ ing migration from northern Europe and found itself caught by violent win@@ ds in the North Sea . &apos;
It seems that the exhausted bir@@ d would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform .
He added : &apos; He was unable to fly again , so we have been cont@@ acted to help . &apos;
The water water was healthy when it was released .
Is the European elite prepared to do business with Britain ?
The Business for Brit@@ ain campaign was launched in April with the promise of meeting businesses and defining what creat@@ ors of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
In order to do this , we commissioned the wid@@ est and most comprehensive investigation from the British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , businesses and the EU .
Y@@ anu@@ v questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , who are generally representative of all sizes of companies , sectors and regions of Britain .
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on the countries that are modern@@ izing and developing while EU states are stag@@ n@@ ating .
They want to see the government priori@@ tising new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming European institutional ar@@ can@@ es .
When they ask their views on specific political points - ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws - the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key skills should go to West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market has caused general dis@@ content , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area - 40 % of the large , traditionally pro-European , companies are even in agreement .
Last but not least , our survey with the entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted to see the United Kingdom continue with the initiatives to change the Treaty and to develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics .
This conclusion , which finds itself in all large groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a &apos; significant change &apos; that gives power to the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high - to change the treaty and to represent the interests of Britain better .
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that businesses hope that the re@@ negotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of British companies , since the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for businesses this means placing the emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels .

Alex@@ i Gaz@@ pro@@ m states that Bulgaria &apos;s gas pipeline bo@@ des a new era of gas .
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared the Director of Gaz@@ pro@@ m .
&apos;@@ A historic event has taken place today : construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most important project in Europe &apos; , explained Alex@@ i Mill@@ er , the Director-General of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its counterpart from Ukraine , a country by which the largest part of Russian gas for Europe passes , increases the level of risk compared with conventional routes , adds the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct order to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are being eliminated &apos; forever &apos; .
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas from South Stream at a reduced tariff as soon as the whole project is put into operation in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m has indicated that construction should start in other down@@ stream countries by the end of the year .
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
The world &apos;s largest marine reserve
The island of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ re@@ n wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world , announced on Thursday the New Ta@@ hi@@ i newspaper , which includes information from Rad@@ io Australia .
This island , in the east of the G@@ ambi@@ er archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last United Kingdom territory in the South Pacific , half way between New Zealand and Chile .
The territory is 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , with three other small islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the ma@@ m@@ mo@@ th of the B@@ orders , an episo@@ de of the English na@@ vy &apos;s history , which gives rise to three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adap@@ tations .
A few tens of inhabitants , most of whom are des@@ c@@ endants of the muti@@ l@@ ants of the Bou@@ rest , still live P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ in , and their incomes depend on 95 % of London &apos;s generosity .
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of creating a marine reserve around the small archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , or 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the may@@ or of the island went to London asking Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ n , the May@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ in , believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for the island .
The project must be accepted by the English Govern@@ or of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ in , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would make it possible for the United Kingdom to sanc@@ ti@@ fy these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ in , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft that are dedicated to the surveillance of the area , and there is no port where there is no port of surveillance .
As for France , it must already carry out the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 of the E@@ E@@ Z@@ s of the French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia , the neighbour of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ in .
The FA@@ A rela@@ xed restrictions on the use of electronic g@@ ad@@ gets on aircraft - but it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones .

Life for a former Chinese Deputy Govern@@ or
A former Deputy Govern@@ or of the province of Ji@@ in , in the north-@@ east of China , was sentenced to the life prison on Friday for corruption .
As far as the Communist Party in July 2012 is concerned , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of having affected more than 19 million y@@ ou@@ ths of bri@@ bes , reporting the Chinese official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Govern@@ or , who was also the President of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public establishment , helped businesses and officials to obtain contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first intermediate court in Beijing on its micro@@ phone .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party .
If the Head of State promised that justice would also be in@@ trac@@ table with the powerful &apos; tig@@ ers &apos; with the &apos; m@@ asses &apos; - the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted , including former executives of the oil giant Pe@@ tro@@ ch@@ ina .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CC@@ P leader in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office in the state .
However , the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-@@ corruption system by creating , for example , an independent party body .
Two Y@@ M@@ A employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , at a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission .
Two employees of the Y@@ IC@@ A in New Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following allegations against the educ@@ ator Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h , J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , in 2011 , at a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission charged with child sex abuse .
However , in its opening statement before the Commission , the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A said that it &apos; never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organisation &apos; .
The Director-General Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ re was asked about two cases : a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employee was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instruc@@ tor of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he was working in 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ re said in G@@ ail F@@ ur@@ n@@ ess , who was a lawyer with the Commission , that he had known the first case but was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A opening declaration was in@@ accurate by stressing , &apos; external controls of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A have been carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organisation &apos; .
It has been demonstrated to the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A had been informed that it had been given the second worst assessment of four institutions during a quality audit of the De@@ par@@ ate of Education and Comm@@ uni@@ ties carried out in August this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who started working in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to check that the employees knew that they had to report any violation of child safety policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord was convicted of sexual assa@@ ults on twelve boys during the two years in which he worked in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A .
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison .
But Mr Ha@@ re rejected the idea that the Y@@ M@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord &apos;s failings in the safety of children .
The staff have testi@@ fied that they have observed certain shortcomings , particularly the fact that Lord remained alone with children , that he was private in private , made them sitting on his k@@ nees , told them that he loved and left them with his mobile phone .
Mr O@@ ick@@ well , who was controlled by Lord and who had asked for training in the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that she was responsible for the Y@@ M@@ C@@ C@@ A , J@@ ac@@ u Bar@@ n@@ at , who would be a very inti@@ mi@@ date and difficult to approach most of the time .
The Director-General said that he rejected the testi@@ mony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these failings to their superi@@ ors .
Instead , he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have fo@@ stered their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Ha@@ re said that he had expressed his views on the Y@@ IC@@ A board of New Wales in the South saying that , for the organisation , the lesson learned from the &apos; J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord incident &apos; was not to concern &apos; the sign@@ alling &apos; by the staff , and the Council agreed with him .
Mr Ha@@ re said that the decision to sign the staff of the confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations have been mentioned , was taken by the Director-General of the Y@@ M@@ A , who was responsible for childcare , Li@@ am White .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence , but that it was an &apos; excess of ze@@ al &apos; and was badly implemented .
The Y@@ M@@ A of New Wales was not a safe organisation for children at a time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord was employed , namely between 2009 and 2011 , he declared the expert on sexual violence against children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ m@@ all@@ stone of the University of G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith in the Commission .
He said that there were &apos; serious problems &apos; in recruitment , control , initi@@ ation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister , but recognises that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night with the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office , the man of 59 has made his views known on various national policies .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special En@@ voy for the Middle East peace process .
When asked whether he would like to see the post of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have responded , according to the E@@ ven@@ ing Stand@@ ard in London : &apos; Yes , of course , but it may happen , so ... &apos;
When many experts in the demonstrations in Cardiff met in Cardiff to face up and win over the Ch@@ ev@@ al of the year , they knew that competition would be ru@@ ined .
However , no one expected to see a 3@@ 0-@@ year old man .
Not yet in school and only a few months after having made its first weapons , the small and small business She@@ t@@ land T@@ fl@@ e tro@@ t@@ ted during the three rounds with a great ease and won the first price , leaving the 30 other adults behind them .
The two in@@ separ@@ able - which are of the same size - were welcomed for the presentation , attitude and style in the annual contest that took place in the centre of S@@ un@@ n@@ y@@ bank , to R@@ ud@@ y near Cardiff .
He had a h@@ at on the side against men and women with e@@ leg@@ ant tal@@ es , and he had his h@@ at on the side in a way that he did not want to get rid of his 2 years old tra@@ ine@@ e .
F@@ ore@@ on was welcomed by the judges for the natural qualities of un@@ common drawing up for a child of his age .
And T@@ offer has received very good notes for his presentation and personality .
Thir@@ ty in March last year , we had T@@ la@@ e@@ e in the gift of his 3@@ r@@ d birth@@ day , and he has been involved with his head@@ line She@@ t@@ land every day .
His mother Don@@ na , 30 years ago , said : &apos; F@@ em@@ on and T@@ offer are doing an excellent &apos; .
They have stood up against and against all , but both have missed the gold and ro@@ ck cut .
It was only the second time that he was in T@@ offering and we were delighted that he won .
On the tra@@ il , people who did not know it was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to be photo@@ graph@@ ed with him .
This young bo@@ y , the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ low V@@ ale , in the south of Wales , is following the foot@@ steps of his colleague Sharon H@@ ow@@ l@@ ls , who has been involved in disputed competi@@ tions for more than 10 years .
Mrs H@@ ow@@ l@@ ls said : &apos; There was electricity in the air and everybody encouraged it and applau@@ ded it . &apos;
He has travelled all along the way and even if he seemed to be a little bit , he did a wonderful job .
F@@ ore@@ on is f@@ ou of animals - he ad@@ mits hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors and the rural world and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens .
From the way he started , he will surely soon be taking part in the demonstration in the Sh@@ ev@@ al of the year - and I am sure he will do a good job .
A spokes@@ person for the annual qu@@ e@@ ing event said : &apos; F@@ ore@@ on is only 3 years old , but he knows how to drive him . &apos;
They are a good team .
The judges have noticed that F@@ ment@@ on and Th@@ off@@ e were well aware of the way in which they put their names on the line .
They are looking for effective team work between the pon@@ der and the tra@@ der - F@@ ment@@ on and T@@ offer have been the best on the path .
I am sure that his fine clo@@ thes helped F@@ ment@@ on , he was very proud .
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call &apos; will be recast &apos; .
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-@@ page call for the release of a journalist accused of def@@ am@@ ation will be res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ed , he says a press regulator .
The New Ex@@ press based in Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Mr Ch@@ en subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bri@@ bes to make stories about a semi-@@ public society .
Now the New Ex@@ press is going to undergo a &apos; complete overhaul &apos; , has declared the regulator .
The order of &apos; res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling &apos; comes from the administration of Gu@@ ang@@ don for Pres@@ se and Di@@ di@@ tion , Rad@@ io , F@@ il@@ m and Tele@@ vision .
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Ex@@ press , belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing Ne@@ ws group , had published a number of incorrect articles on the company listed Z@@ o@@ om@@ on between September 2012 and August 2013 .
&apos;@@ New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organized &apos; , said the regulator in a statement .
He said that he had decided &apos; to impose sanctions of an administrative nature in Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press card &apos; .
He also &apos; ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing Ne@@ ws group to undertake a complete overhaul of the New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the people responsible for New Ex@@ press and immediately re@@ kin@@ dle the newspaper leadership team &apos; .
Mr Ch@@ en has written a number of articles for the New Ex@@ press on the alleged financial irregularities of a factory manufacturer called Z@@ o@@ om@@ on .
After his arrest , his newspaper published on two occasions a call on the first page for his release , writing he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Mr Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television station where he admitted that he had published false stories against money .
&apos;@@ In this case , I have cl@@ ou@@ ded to Z@@ o@@ om@@ on and to the media industry and to its ability to win public confidence &apos; , he declared the public television network CC@@ TV .
I did so mainly because I was running after money and cele@@ bra@@ tions .
I have seen my mistake .
Following Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s apologies , New Ex@@ press published his apologies on the first page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects have recently made television .

The Char@@ les@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le aircraft carrier in &apos; un@@ availability &apos;
In T@@ oul@@ on , the aircraft carrier is in the off@@ ing .
The radioactive ste@@ am le@@ ak detected on one of the two nuclear driver of Charles de Gaul@@ le , in mid-@@ October and when the ship was at sea , was &apos; safe for seafarers &apos; , but it is not without a consequence for the Mari@@ e .
In fact , the Ro@@ yal has confirmed to us &apos; the un@@ availability &apos; of the vessel until &apos; mid-@@ November &apos; , &apos; time to take the appropriate corrective measures &apos; .
For its part , the S@@ N@@ C , specialist in the defence naval sector , ensures that its teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , who are caught in the V@@ ar for the opportunity , &apos; take part in the aircraft carrier &apos; .
It is for them , among other things , to change a p@@ ump on failing heating .
&apos;@@ Everything is being done to ensure that Charles de Gaul@@ le can carry out his planned deployment at the end of 2013 &apos; .
And the national Mari@@ e is to certi@@ fy that &apos; it does not call into question the &apos; nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion &apos; programme .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Char@@ les@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le is fate for six months .
He had operated in T@@ oul@@ on in mid-@@ October for training .
This , in particular , is to describe the young pilot pil@@ ots .
A &apos; small ch@@ y &apos; , circum@@ s@@ cri@@ bed in the reactor &apos;s area of contain@@ ment , then occurred on the flagship ship of the French fleet .
According to the national Mari@@ e , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a great deal of dis@@ pleasure from the people I meet : a mon@@ str@@ ous re@@ valuation of their properties , a flood of taxes , the cost of permits of all kinds , and administrative costs .
In short , there is no limit on our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of dol@@ lar@@ -@@ denom@@ inated dollars could be saved in order to allow much respectful taxation of those who pay .
Any money that is being taken out of force by taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impover@@ ishment .
In Sh@@ aw@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , there is no problem with the s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ary expenditure and the maintenance of lame duc@@ ks : a deficit centre , a strong subsidy to the Energy City and so on .
If these facilities are not profitable , they are sold to private enterprise or demo@@ bili@@ zed .
It is also sad to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come .
However , I would like to make an honourable reference to the transformation of the old W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a kind of industrial inc@@ ub@@ ator , but at what cost for tax pay@@ ers ?
It is not for public pa@@ vers to invest in such companies , but for the private sector based on consumer demand .
The citizens were pleased to learn that the la@@ kes in Fisheries and P@@ ic@@ les will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
Following the departure of all the industries ( major water consumption ) and the large decline in the population , the use of water has fallen considerably throughout the territory .
Without wishing to waste it , the city will never lack water and the strict regulation on its use could be greatly ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ated .
In short , it is very easy to achieve a great deal with other money .
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance .
With a gross debt of more than USD 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a p@@ en without a borrowing regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years by en@@ coun@@ ties with fine degrees for most , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse .
Op@@ en a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railways
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting systems , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric ra@@ ils , was discovered .
The US authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages that they had ever seen .
The tunnel , z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag@@ ant on an equivalent length of six long football grounds , links w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ j@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go , the United States .
The area is full of in@@ trac@@ table w@@ are@@ houses , which makes it easy to hide the heavy goods vehicles .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it in@@ discrimin@@ ately .
The authorities seized 8@@ .5 tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel was discovered , according to judicial cases .
Three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers , were accused of possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e .
They run a prison sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted .
In Nov@@ al , Ari@@ z@@ ona , the smugg@@ lers exploit vast underground channels .
The tunnel is the eigh@@ th important passage discovered in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the largest tun@@ n@@ els have been discovered following the har@@ vest@@ ing of mari@@ ju@@ ana in the centre of Mexico in October , posing a challenge for drug car@@ t@@ els that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 y@@ ards f@@ itted with f@@ lan@@ king routes from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of a Ti@@ j@@ ana house and went up to two w@@ are@@ houses of San Di@@ e@@ go .
The British police
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the foun@@ der of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge in the Ecu@@ ador Em@@ bas@@ sy in London and called for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said that she had issued a &apos; de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation opinion &apos; against the Austr@@ ali@@ an of 40 years , asking him to present himself to a police officer , saying that if he did not , he would be able to be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited in Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime , having exhausted every possible aven@@ ue under British law after the Supreme Court has invali@@ dated the call that he made against his extradition at the beginning of the month .
Bearing in mind that Stockholm allows its transfer to the United States , it found refuge in the Ecu@@ ador Em@@ bas@@ sy in London on 19 June calling on this country of South America to asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has &apos; issued an opinion against a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man who asks him to present himself to a police officer , on the date and time of his choice &apos; , he said a spokes@@ person .
It continues to violate the conditions for its release .
The Ambassador has refused to comment on the issuing of the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange fears being extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of sp@@ ying , after un@@ ve@@ iling more than 250 000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks site combating secret information .
How will biome@@ tr@@ ics inv@@ ade our lives
Are the words &apos; to ta@@ p &apos; to get access to its mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on or pay for it ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by the biometric capture of phones and computers .
Ber@@ n@@ ard Di@@ di@@ er , the Deputy Director-General of Mor@@ ph@@ o , even believes that &apos; the century will be biometric &apos; .
Only biome@@ tr@@ ics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a uni@@ verse and transnational uni@@ verse .
Organis@@ ations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biome@@ tr@@ ics , but are concerned about it .
In 2011 and France alone , the National Commission for IT and Freedoms authorised 7@@ 74 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the form of the hand or the ve@@ il network of hand in companies , administrations and can@@ te@@ ens ...
&apos;@@ Everyone will soon be able to be identified , anywhere and anywhere &apos; , to be moved to Washington , which is the responsibility of the private life of consumers in the CD@@ T and Technology .
The reasons for such optimism , for some , and for pessimis@@ m , among others ?
biome@@ tr@@ ics will be based on new techniques , which will enable new services to be made available to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are fingerprints , the hand of hand and the ve@@ il network of p@@ am or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;@@ For example , some people who work the concrete have a very ab@@ y@@ sm@@ al fin@@ gers and their fingerprints are il@@ legi@@ ble &apos; , as Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , the technical director of the identity field in Th@@ ales and Security .
The collection and verification of the ve@@ il network and the hand of the hand mean a voluntary and specific gesture of people .
It is both a security and one that cannot be taken into account in their in@@ puts - and one draw@@ back - the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time .
As a result , research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches , such as the recognition of the face or the ice ( the col@@ or@@ ated part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the cap@@ tors and the ability to calculate the computers required for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The prec@@ ision of fac@@ ile recognition has been multi@@ plied by ten in the last five years , cal@@ ming C@@ y@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , Director of R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border cross@@ ings using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or i@@ ris on the move .
&apos;@@ Today , we are carrying out research into the recognition of the voice or the way to walk with the help of sound cap@@ s , but we need a silent environment &apos; , which indicates S@@ ri@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , the Director of Security Research to In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
A single and inde@@ fen@@ sible Mar@@ qu@@ or , DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
&apos;@@ In the current state of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirms S@@ op@@ hi@@ e V@@ ul@@ li@@ t-@@ T@@ ou@@ denial , Director of Stu@@ dies , Innovation and O@@ ut@@ look to C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But the DNA analysis is still very long and costly .
N@@ EP@@ C proposes a value of EUR 9@@ 0@@ ,000 for the judicial police services to analyse s@@ amples of DNA in the place of a crime and in an hour .
The use of biome@@ tr@@ ics is divided into two groups : identification ( recognition of one person among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( to ensure that the person is the one it claims to be ) .
The identification concerned the issuing of identity papers so far : the biome@@ tr@@ ics ( fingerprints , photo@@ grap@@ h , i@@ ris ) have to be confronted with the information that the state has on all the citizens who have already been frozen .
This makes it possible to ensure that someone is not trying to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison may have other applications .
N@@ EP@@ C is therefore proposing the recognition of V@@ III for a ho@@ tel or a shop .
&apos;@@ We reject the images of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compare them to the photo@@ graph@@ s of cele@@ bri@@ ties circul@@ ating freely on the Internet &apos; , explaining Dan@@ y N@@ assi@@ f , who is responsible , at home France , for trade development for biometric identification solutions .
Another use : taking into photo@@ grap@@ h a qu@@ id pr@@ o quo in a shop , following his progress through fac@@ ial recognition and calculate waiting times .
Re@@ auth@@ enti@@ fication initially concerned physical access ( borders , protected local , can@@ te@@ ens ... ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
Then , more recently , there was control .
&apos;@@ A biometric light avoi@@ ds the C@@ op@@ tic phenomenon that is leading for another &apos; justifies C@@ y@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , Ac@@ coun@@ tability .
More and more , however , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also apply to transactions , especially those made from connected devices to the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and putting its hand on a biometric read@@ er : this gesture re@@ places the strike of the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is being tested in V@@ ill@@ en@@ u@@ ve@@ -@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and An@@ dro@@ me by the Nat@@ ur@@ al-@@ Security company in partnership with the big distribution banks and teachers : when it comes to paying in shops with its banking card , the customer does not ta@@ p his code , but introduces his finger in a read@@ er who scan@@ ns the cal@@ ves .
The experiment is planned for six months .
If it is conclu@@ sive , biometric read@@ ers may soon come to the French traders .
S@@ olu@@ tions to reassure users
There are three ways of making biome@@ tr@@ ics attractive to the general public .
The first is to explain that it can save time .
&apos;@@ If , thanks to biome@@ tr@@ ics , a customer is still in charge of 30 seconds less , that is a good thing &apos; , the director of a large area will be explained .
The second is to provide person@@ alised services : in a few years &apos; time a voting ser@@ ver will be able to recognise your voice and propose options .
Last but not least , I should like to reassure them by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;@@ fingerprints are stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos;s identities are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure bo@@ y , which is blocked if attempts are made to move it &apos; , lists Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in Rob@@ in , Th@@ ales .
But , because of a lack of thorough studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
Experts on the protection of privacy continue to worry .
&apos;@@ The progress of fac@@ ile recognition , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of the surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and the huge amount of photo@@ graph@@ s available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or Pi@@ cast@@ a , make me fear the worst : generalised surveillance &apos; , predic@@ ting An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , the Commissioner for the Protection of Pri@@ v@@ acy in Canada .
A driver running at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink between the leg@@ s has been given a am@@ muni@@ tion of GBP 1 000 .

Foreign property tax in order to bur@@ st the London bubble
The Treasury has temporarily quanti@@ fied the measure of tax on capital gains but is waiting for a final decision by Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 budget , has placed a 7 % right of stam@@ ps for the properties of more than 2 M@@ P and annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold properties within a society rather than individually .
The right of stam@@ ps already applies to residential properties in West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ el@@ se@@ a , and accounts for 7@@ 08 M in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-@@ East , Nor@@ th@@ west and the Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and H@@ um@@ ber .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &apos; As a result of the increase in the right of stam@@ ps on high value properties and the introduction of the Anti-@@ Fra@@ ud Act in this area , it is very difficult to argue that the value of great value is under@@ imposed independently of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &apos;
&apos;@@ But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the existing owners who are reluctant to sell &apos; .
So@@ ve@@ reign housing - the 5@@ 5-@@ 10 % of the highest prices in the housing market - in the prosperous sector in the south-@@ west of London , which stret@@ ches from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ b@@ ed@@ on , rose by a record percentage of 11.@@ 8 % over the last year .
P@@ ric@@ es in the centre of London show regular growth of 5.@@ 6 % year on year , but have been over@@ shad@@ owed by a growing &apos; internal market &apos; , the south-@@ west of the city , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and is ( 6@@ .5 % ) with a recovery , according to S@@ av@@ ill@@ es &apos;s studies .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted how the qu@@ e@@ ue of a dog &apos;s qu@@ e@@ ue is linked to its mood .
Pre@@ vious studies had revealed that happy dogs were moving more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nerv@@ ous dogs were more to the left .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and respond to them .
Professor Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ tic@@ a , a neuro@@ science of the University of T@@ ren@@ te , said : &apos; Everyone knows that , in man , the left side and the right of the brain are involved differently in the stimul@@ i that awa@@ ken positive or negative emotions . &apos;
Here we have tried to see what happened in other species .
He said that , as well as men , in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and that both hemis@@ p@@ here played a different role in emotions .
In order to know more about how dogs react to the dis@@ orderly movements of other dogs , researchers have followed animals watching films where there were other dogs .
They have measured the heart incidence of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a explained : &apos; We have submitted to dogs where there were other dogs - either an nat@@ ur@@ alist version or a sil@@ t to avoid any further confusion - and we have been able to traffic in the qu@@ e@@ ue and present it to the left or the right . &apos;
When the animals saw a dog without an expression of the qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that was qu@@ eu@@ ing up ) , they remained perfectly de@@ t@@ ached .
But when they got back a qu@@ e@@ ue mainly to the left ( once again from the point of view of the dog that was qu@@ eu@@ ing up ) , their heart frequency accelerated and they were anxious .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ tic@@ a said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communic@@ ating between them with these movements .
Rather , it believes that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet on a number of occasions other dogs , and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their qu@@ e@@ ues on one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude , you will react to that experience . &apos;
Res@@ ear@@ chers indicate that the results could enable owners , ve@@ ts and addic@@ ts to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The expert expert John Bra@@ d@@ sh@@ a@@ w , a prof@@ essor invited to the University of B@@ ris@@ to@@ l University , said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the can@@ ine species .
Last year , a team from the University of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that the dogs were going to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and on the right when it was a je@@ we@@ l dog .
And in another scientific study carried out by Vic@@ tor@@ ia University in Canada , he said : &apos; Do@@ c@@ tors go more easily to a robust dog when his qu@@ e@@ ue w@@ ins to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what is in the Italian study . &apos;
He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs involved in the various studies did not fully consider the animals or ro@@ bo@@ t dogs like dogs .
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
&apos;@@ Although many of the elements , raised in various ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception , he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other .
Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ k@@ ey@@ s is a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w because of Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner &apos;s disease

Pope Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is will name his first car@@ din@@ als in February
Pope Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is will name new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ als are the men of the highest in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect it , so Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor .
There is now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
However , as soon as a car@@ din@@ al reaches the age of 80 , it can no longer take part in the election of a Pope , so it is a group of 120 &apos; car@@ din@@ als &apos; .
In a statement announcing the news , Fa@@ ther F@@ eder@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ b@@ ar@@ di , a V@@ a@@ tic@@ an spokesman , said that a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would take place before the ceremony in which b@@ ish@@ ops will be high on the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as a con@@ scienti@@ ous .
&apos;@@ Pope Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is has decided to communicate his decision to conven@@ e the February con@@ is@@ se in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of the car@@ din@@ als in different parts of the world &apos; , said Lom@@ bar@@ di .
J@@ ack V@@ al@@ al@@ o of the Ca@@ thol@@ ics has said that by February , the number of voters will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many car@@ din@@ als as he needed to ensure that the number of car@@ din@@ als reached 120 and so many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 years ago that he wanted .
The con@@ scienti@@ ous next year will be important , because it will be the first since the election of Pope Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is in March of this year , said Val@@ er@@ o .
At the moment , there is a kind of trend towards Europe and in particular Italy .
&apos;@@ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will name car@@ din@@ als in the rest of the world to restore balance &apos; , he added .
40 % of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of car@@ din@@ als represent them .
Car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is formed the Council of Car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als all over the world charged with examining ways of reforming the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided alone .
&apos;@@ From now on , Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is has chosen these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him &apos; , he has explained Val@@ er@@ o .
He added that he was &apos; entirely possible &apos; that Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is is asking for the car@@ din@@ als .
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is completely new .
V@@ al@@ er@@ o pointed out that the po@@ pes were usually b@@ ish@@ ops representing large communities as car@@ din@@ al , but that Fran@@ Ã§@@ o@@ is was &apos; full of sur@@ prises , so we do not know who he will name &apos; .
G@@ M rec@@ alls some of its new p@@ ick@@ ers in the United States
General Mo@@ tors C@@ o rec@@ alls almost 19 000 of all the new pi@@ ck@@ les Sh@@ ev@@ ro@@ l@@ and Sil@@ ver@@ ado and G@@ M@@ C Sierra 2014 in order to deal with a problem with the dossiers that are inv@@ ari@@ ably written , according to a statement on Friday of the American body responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some p@@ ick@@ ps , the seats before could present a defec@@ t at the mechanism of the mechanism .
As a result , cases do not meet the federal safety standards for vehicles with regard to e-@@ the-@@ counter .
&apos;@@ If the vehicle is lost by the back door , it may be that e-@@ heads do not adequately protect passengers , thus increasing the risk of injuries &apos; , according to the statement on the site of the National High@@ way Tra@@ ffic Safety Administration ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) .
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of GM p@@ ick@@ ps began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009 .
G@@ M informed the owners of the default in the first half of October .
The N@@ H@@ T@@ SA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16 days judgment of government activities , which slow@@ ed down the growth of vehicle sales in October .
The sales of p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps and Sierra Leone , which were re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , rose by around 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , declared GM on Friday .
In October , GM sold 42 6@@ 60 p@@ ick@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and 16 50@@ 3 p@@ ick@@ ps .
The price of GM actions rose by 1.@@ 4 % to USD 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change on Friday afternoon .
A worker dies
A construction worker has died in dozens of concrete blocks , on Thursday , the day before 12 , in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The tragedy took place at 11 a.m. on the Mar@@ qu@@ et@@ te street , close to the inter@@ section of the Be@@ au@@ well street , in the r@@ oun@@ d-@@ off of Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La Pe@@ ti@@ te Patri@@ e .
In all likelihood , there has been work on the foundations in this place for some time .
There has been a f@@ lim@@ sy wall of foundation in the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had come to the site to recover his tools .
I was in car and I saw the wall cr@@ umbling with a great smoke cl@@ oud , said Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I am lan@@ ded and I went to remove the big b@@ ric@@ ks that recovered .
It was only part of his back , that is so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in the fif@@ ties who worked for a co@@ ff@@ er company .
Re@@ li@@ gious manoeuv@@ res have been tempted by emergency services , but without success .
man has not survived his serious injuries .
An inspec@@ tor of the Commission for Health and Security of Work has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
The cry of desper@@ ation by a constituent of Obama
I voted twice in favour of President Obama .
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts with the ob@@ struction of the Republican Party
obstruc@@ tion@@ ism
The memory of Obama &apos;s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened .
N@@ a@@ ath@@ i@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is studying in 2@@ n@@ d year medicine to Har@@ v@@ ard &apos;s F@@ ac@@ ul@@ ty Medic@@ ine .
I am reading an extremely sad book these days .
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the in@@ genu@@ ity of the 2@@ th year of medicine and would give me hope .
He is called &apos; The Au@@ tonom@@ y to W@@ in &apos; , and it is the m@@ emo@@ irs of Barack Obama &apos;s presidential campaign in 2008 .
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening , and I am speaking , this book won me at the time when politicians were inspired by millions of people and speeches could cut you off .
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and pres@@ ti@@ gious news pres@@ ti@@ ors took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des were happy and my parents kept all the newspapers that they found .
A young team of vision@@ aries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition period before he took office in 2008 , he had 82 % in favour .
Then I am closing the book .
The return to the present is a difficult aw@@ ak@@ ening , it is like getting out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism , it is like distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change has really occurred in the years after which I voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put great achievements on the credit of Obama , from the passage of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act to the departure of Iraq from our army , to the end of the &apos; neither seen nor known &apos; and the murder of Os@@ ama bin Laden .
Furthermore , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of GuantÃ¡namo , among other things .
But , having repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my pe@@ ers and my colleagues , I can no longer explain .
I am on the ver@@ ge of political despair .
The Republican ob@@ struction cannot explain foreign leaders , or the attacks of innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collec@@ ts data on the privacy of the Americans , or the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers who reveal the mis@@ deeds of the government .
It cannot justify the murder of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , and the avo@@ idance of public funding and the over@@ sho@@ oting of permitted expenditure during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the &apos; most aggressive ... since Ni@@ xon &apos;s administration &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the im@@ possibility of design@@ ing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I do not know whether that is what I expected .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preced@@ e it .
Obviously , the electoral function is not foreseeable , because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance , such as the New@@ ton massacre , are influen@@ cing our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what anno@@ ys me most .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a confused and un@@ refin@@ ed alternative that seemed not to be able to determine his policies or positions .
I knew that Obama , who was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections , would make the promises that we have been hearing about for so long .
Yet , while the favourable opinion index plun@@ ged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I welcome the many promises that have been made .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses in the profits of Clinton to the Pri@@ may@@ ors of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting he told his team that they had to get back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause .
&apos;@@ I want us to focus on our talent &apos; .
We must remember who we are .
We are five years after , Mr President , and I do not agree with you any more .

The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s d@@ augh@@ ters were prepared to benefit personally from these policies .
&apos;@@ He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying off parental leave because if one of his d@@ augh@@ ters is pregnant , he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave &apos; , he said Mr Pal@@ mer .
Two months after his election , the Elec@@ toral Commission officially stated that Mr Pal@@ mer won the seat of S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast of F@@ ai@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes , after re@@ counting .
Mr Pal@@ mer has put forward the idea of a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling of the voting system to speed up the process .
The d@@ augh@@ ters of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , Franc@@ is and Bri@@ d@@ gy .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over ?
&apos;@@ We need a better system &apos; , he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , take your coordinated action in a computer , vote immediately and get the result at 6.@@ 30 p.m. the next morning ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of paper pen@@ s to mark the ballot papers .
Is it to be able to er@@ ase the result if anyone is not in agreement ?
Nowadays , having a paper paper seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has studied the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he would take his new role &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service .
&apos;@@ We are not looking for reward , except for the reward for history , because we must serve the community at a critical moment &apos; , he added .
A team of bi@@ olog@@ ists headed by the Wil@@ d@@ life Corpor@@ ation Society in New York has identified a new species of dol@@ ph@@ in on the northern coast of Australia .
T@@ hi@@ b@@ au@@ x B@@ uc@@ ou@@ x , charged with scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for the Conser@@ vation and A@@ qu@@ it@@ ude of A@@ ni@@ ills and Mi@@ locations Mar@@ ins ( O@@ C@@ EM@@ M@@ M ) is for the Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Is the discovery of this new species of dol@@ ph@@ in ?
This is good news , but it does not surprise me particularly .
If , in the past , species have been described and identified on a mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ atomic and geographical basis , today the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics enables us to improve our knowledge in science of the classification of species .
It is not possible , moreover , that these advances in gene@@ tics and m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology call into question the classification or membership of a type of species , a family or even an order .
At the beginning of the 19@@ th century , mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ists classified animals , based on mor@@ pho@@ logical differences between species .
Today , some of these ran@@ kings are called into question because of genetic progress .
Similarly , two species that are very close to mor@@ pho@@ logically have been distinguished by genetic engineering .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
Ten years ago , the scientific community recognized two species belonging to that sub-@@ family : dol@@ ph@@ ins in the Pacific and the Atlantic wh@@ ales .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is it an important discovery , as the Wil@@ d@@ life Corpor@@ ation Society said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic vari@@ ability .
Had this population been known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only in that place .
Therefore , if a problem of mass mortality caused by a vir@@ al epidemic or acci@@ dental catch arises in the region , we may have to deal with the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than the local disappearance of a population of a more widely spread species on earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered according to the number of existing people on earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it has to recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to the S@@ ous@@ a ch@@ un@@ k , whose population of the new species discovered is out , its stock has automatically become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ genous , open habitats , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This bre@@ vity of genes limits the creation of new species .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which can eventually create new species .
We must be aware that the marine environment is the least well known .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts to M@@ ars , to know what is living in the gra@@ ves of Mari@@ ann@@ es , only 11 kilometres from the sea area .
More money is spent on research into other plan@@ ets than on marine research and it is high time that this changed .
R@@ B@@ S suspended two traders on the exchange market
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland has suspended two tra@@ ine@@ es from its exchange of exchange markets according to two sources close to the dossier , which shows once again that the global investigation of regulators on suspicion of manipulation of the currency market is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the largest banks in the world , including U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world &apos;s most important financial market investigations , where USD 5.@@ 3 trillion is changing every day .
The two traders are the first employees of R@@ B@@ S to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation which echo@@ es the scandal of the manipulation of the inter@@ bank rate .
The bank , which refused to comment on the suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month received requests for information from regulators .
&apos;@@ The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we cooperate fully with the F@@ C@@ F and the other regulators &apos; , declared a bank representative two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the dossier have stated that R@@ B@@ S had passed on e-@@ ma@@ ils and in@@ stant messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , to the British regulator , the Financial Con@@ di@@ tions Authority .
This tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 and would have been suspended from the post of European Tra@@ ding Tra@@ ding officer in J@@ P@@ Morgan .
Ro@@ h@@ an Ra@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , a European company responsible for the exchange of foreign exchange in Ci@@ ti , was put on holiday this week , while Mat@@ t Gar@@ d@@ er , a tra@@ der of currency in Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S , was suspended by Stand@@ ard Char@@ ter@@ ed this week .
None of these traders have been charged .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s dossier included in@@ stant messages sent to and by bankers working in Bar@@ cl@@ ay@@ s and Ci@@ ti@@ group , who added to the issue .
U@@ B@@ S explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , said that he was investigating suspic@@ ions of manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities - the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , the Swiss competition authority W@@ e@@ k@@ o , the F@@ F , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - look at the allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ Morgan and Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from regulators , have indicated sources that are close to the case .
The banks have pl@@ agu@@ ed in@@ stant messages and em@@ ail@@ s for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
The news about these investigations has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banks in recent years , but which has been questioned this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers have tried to minim@@ ize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast liquid currency market , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A golden tra@@ der has said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use of banks in their own internal platforms &apos; explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost &apos; .
The news came on the same day that the C@@ re@@ t@@ Ã© Switzerland announced that it had sent a tra@@ der to its office of funds negotiated on the London stock exchange this week after it caused a loss of USD 6 million at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators .
&apos;@@ We are convinced that the tra@@ der has acted on its own and that the case has been controlled &apos; , has indicated a representative of the Swiss C@@ ase .
The investigation of May@@ or Ro@@ b
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the vide@@ o that would show Ro@@ b Ford f@@ lowing from the cr@@ ick , M@@ e C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by supported that he had never seen such a bot@@ ched investigation .
M@@ e Ru@@ by said in the Pres@@ se Canad@@ ians that the police had &apos; ignored or minim@@ ized &apos; evidence against the may@@ or .
On Thursday , the police arrested the occa@@ sional friend and driver of Ro@@ b Ford , Alexander Lis@@ i , aged 35 , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion on video .
Alexander Lis@@ i , who was previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police have said that they have also observed that man issuing the par@@ c@@ el to Ro@@ b Ford , indicating new court documents .
M@@ e Ru@@ by called it &apos; in@@ explic@@ able &apos; the fact that the police have never sear@@ ched Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s vehicle or his home , or on listening to his phone , arguing that the police leader Bill Blair has chosen to do nothing against the may@@ or .
Under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands , could very well have inter@@ cep@@ ted Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s vehicle , arrested the may@@ or , and carry out a search - even without a mandate .
It could also have demanded an in@@ stant search mandate , if deemed necessary .
The Head of Police has not commented , but his spokesman Mar@@ k P@@ u@@ g@@ ou@@ h has described the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by as &apos; obvious and desperate attempt &apos; to press for the media in a case that is not in any way relevant .
At the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &apos; reasonable motives &apos; that could lead to a criminal accusation against the may@@ or .
European stock markets
With the exception of London , the major European stock markets are falling on Friday at mid@@ night , over@@ shad@@ owed by some of the new disappointing companies , while Wel@@ sh is expected to rise .
On the other hand , investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could set up its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , after an inflation rate of 0.7 % for the euro area as a whole , the idea is spread among the market players that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street suggests that there will be an increase in US actions , after two con@@ secu@@ tive sessions .
To the values , Rena@@ ult ( 4.@@ 63 % ) recorded the strongest re@@ treat from CA@@ C 40 , which was over@@ shad@@ owed by the warning about the outcome of its N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor Friday partner .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) marks the worst performance of Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 , having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a structure of de@@ fi@@ ance ( &apos; ba@@ ad ban@@ k &apos; ) involving GBP 38 billion of the most risky assets .
For its part , V@@ od@@ af@@ e ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) is still in the forefront of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 increases in response to press information that T@@ T is to study a possible takeover bid .
On the exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the ECB &apos;s monetary policy is going well , as John Har@@ dy testi@@ fies to in Sa@@ x@@ o Bank .
The ECB &apos;s single mandate has always focused on inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reason to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
We are anticip@@ ating a great potential for a reduction in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its re@@ treat against the US currency and has hit a lower than two weeks at USD 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 .
The same con@@ jec@@ ture is in contrast to the euro area bond market .
The Supreme Court valid@@ ates Obama &apos;s health-care reform
A great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court has said today that the reform of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional .
By 5 votes against 4 , the judges valid@@ ated the individual mandate of the P@@ ati@@ ent Protection and Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ( law on the protection of patients and affordable care ) - which requires citizens to sign up to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they will have to pay a fine - and have said that it is constitutional under the government &apos;s power of taxation .
The President of the Supreme Court , John Rob@@ er@@ ts , joined the four most liberal members of the Court , while judges S@@ c@@ li@@ a , Thomas , A@@ li@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy expressed their disagreement .
The Court has also valid@@ ated the other sections of the 2 700 pages law and has , moreover , considered that the provision of the health system reform law , which states that the eligibility threshold should be low@@ ered to Medic@@ aid , should be coer@@ cive in accordance with the constitution , if it is not to lose all federal funding .
The procedure for blocking the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National F@@ eder@@ ation of Investment .
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the first place in 2012 , including the candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , were fier@@ cely opposed to the law .
Con@@ gratul@@ ations to the former combat@@ ants in Man@@ on
At the heart of the c@@ eme@@ tery of the T@@ ram@@ u@@ qu@@ et , civil , religious and military authorities , as well as many patri@@ otic associations , have made a tribute to the soldiers and de@@ pu@@ ties of all wars on Friday afternoon .
B@@ loc@@ ks have been lod@@ ged in two of the three military ma@@ sters of the c@@ eme@@ tery by the may@@ or Jean-@@ Claude Gu@@ i@@ b@@ al and various person@@ alities .
Agreement between Palestinians and Israelis on Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on Thursday 31 October 2013 in a violent c@@ up on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday , 1 November after the deple@@ tion of its fuel stocks , announced the Energy Authority of the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve .
A local comm@@ ander of the Bri@@ g@@ ades A@@ zz@@ e@@ di@@ ine Al@@ ass@@ am , K@@ hal@@ ed Abu B@@ ak@@ r , and another framework of the armed arm of Hamas , R@@ abi@@ e@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a sh@@ ell@@ s of sh@@ ell@@ s during an incur@@ sion by the Israeli army to the east of K@@ han Y@@ oun@@ Ã¨s , in the south of Gaza , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials in the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ as@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ ou@@ d , died when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four combat@@ ants were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
A Tun@@ nel
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli c@@ at and a bl@@ ank bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er made an incur@@ sion of a hundred metres inside the territory and then with@@ drew .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communi@@ qu@@ Ã© , a Hamas spokesman , Sam@@ i Abu Z@@ ou@@ ha@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &apos; her@@ oes &apos; and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died in confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ assa@@ m who fell by defending the territory in an incur@@ sion by the Z@@ ion@@ ist occup@@ ier in K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ n@@ Ã¨s .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;@@ Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &apos; , threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army has indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a broad tunnel that has been increasing in Israeli territory since the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , discovered on 7 October and , according to the army , intended for &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed the use of tun@@ n@@ els to fight against Israel , stating that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers in order to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communi@@ qu@@ Ã© .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive en@@ sla@@ vement aimed at the forces of T@@ Sa@@ h@@ al ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israel in northern Syria
&apos;@@ This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians &apos; , and the spokes@@ person for the Peter L@@ er@@ ner has also said that .
On the other hand , Israel has hit an air military base in north-@@ west Syria , aimed at a cargo of missiles for the Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement , which reported on Thursday 31 October the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite station .
A US official has confirmed an &apos; Israeli strike &apos; but has not given details of the target .
&apos;@@ In the past , the targets were missiles transferred to H@@ iz@@ bollah &apos; , and it was simply added .
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
These are the &apos; exclusive sources &apos; that it has not named , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that &apos; the bombing targeted a cargo of air missiles that was intended for H@@ iz@@ bollah in Lebanon &apos; , referring to the powerful Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .
Ear@@ lier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory , reported several explo@@ sions on Wednesday at the d@@ aw@@ n in an air defence base at S@@ on@@ ar J@@ ab@@ Ã© , near L@@ attacked , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation based on a network of medical activists and sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explo@@ sions .
The black and white for Mari@@ e Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , who is presenting to Dan@@ e Dan@@ se his two new h@@ ord@@ es of group : the first inspired of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ he@@ u &apos;s en@@ coun@@ ters and po@@ ems , the second inf@@ l@@ ated by the famous so@@ ano G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ se@@ es of S@@ EM .
One evening that makes it possible to see the whole pr@@ ism of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , art and black paper in white .
A white scre@@ en serves as a wall of substance .
On the table , as white as it is , in the huge space that is the The@@ is@@ like M@@ ai@@ be@@ ll , in advance , of profile , an end like a black line and clothing , a body .
On the scre@@ en , a ink of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ he@@ l is planned .
The body , simple , takes its form .
And this form will be the whole coin : a str@@ ing of physical im@@ itation of design@@ s .
The d@@ an@@ gers , which are completely d@@ ressed in black , only their hands and face face , are waiting on each side of the game , rush@@ ing when the next geography appears , inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ating it , getting out of hand .
The black and white game of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ he@@ au is being made up of so@@ lo@@ s , in a group in un@@ ison ( a mass that is w@@ rea@@ king ) , a large group of twelve so@@ lo@@ s where everyone is performing his sign .
We are thinking of &apos; G@@ l@@ ory morning &apos; , where , in sol@@ o , Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard carried out a series of written col@@ leg@@ es on car@@ t@@ els , which are online .
This is the same principle , a giant Po@@ w@@ er@@ Po@@ int version .
Here music is strong , per@@ me@@ ated and electrical .
Energy is high , the pace is always fast .
There will be a ca@@ p when Car@@ ol Pri@@ or takes refuge under the d@@ an@@ cing car@@ pet , to hand over , micro@@ phone , without so@@ bri@@ ety or restraint , one part of Mic@@ hel@@ l &apos;s po@@ em , mono@@ cr@@ or@@ de and mon@@ ot@@ one , and will continue with d@@ an@@ cing .
And music to re@@ start , and the sequ@@ ence to resume .
This sound and energe@@ tic discharge , which is long , if that may be the case , will end up overwhel@@ med and eng@@ ul@@ fed .
As is also the case with the regul@@ arity of the visual pace .
There are some fine f@@ ash@@ s - the creation of images has always been a force in Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard - such as those ha@@ ir who s@@ cra@@ p or these black tissu@@ es , which extend the lines .
But the ch@@ or@@ us approach is lacking .
You have the impression that the ch@@ or@@ us , instead of going to the Mic@@ hel@@ le works , has been imposed , with its tic@@ ks .
As a result , the bodies seem to be at pain@@ s .
Mic@@ hel@@ l &apos;s car@@ c@@ asses , like the forms of G@@ es@@ tal@@ t , open up a broader and g@@ as-@@ gu@@ zz@@ ling imag@@ inary than d@@ an@@ cing .
Only the end , in negative terms , with its d@@ an@@ cing d@@ row@@ ned by a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold light and the white signs in a suddenly black theat@@ re , affects magic .
The public was very pleased , the welcome was warm .
The G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ is , after the event , is richer .
The scene is partly b@@ red , d@@ an@@ ters and pi@@ ano are covered of tissu@@ e , like fur@@ nit@@ ure in a abandoned house .
In the pi@@ ano , d@@ an@@ ters were going to play their part .
Their mis@@ addresses in music , tou@@ ching , give real frag@@ ility .
On the scene , we pass couples , who are lo@@ vely , very sen@@ sory , even ero@@ tic .
Working group , small s@@ lo@@ s of transi@@ tions , sets out that is moving , shocking , writing is less bin@@ ary .
There are b@@ reath , so familiar with Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , with the red no@@ se , with very pol@@ ari@@ zed men and women .
The am@@ ate@@ urs are car@@ n@@ as@@ ers , fu@@ tures or players .
gest@@ ures , la@@ ugh@@ s and small cri@@ es trans@@ mit the ar@@ cha@@ ic , the gr@@ ace and the ridiculous of the bodies in the co@@ ol , of the people who are founded .
But the coin takes its real flight after sal@@ vation .
A c@@ lown is on the scene when the public leaves .

Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g and Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i
The group which has thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents has started an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of legal proceedings on patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers , in particular Google , the company that he ha@@ st@@ ened to the po@@ le at the auc@@ tioning of patents that took place after Nor@@ tel bankruptcy .
Ro@@ k@@ st@@ or , the cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um that acquired the Nor@@ tel patents for USD 4@@ .5 , has lod@@ ged a complaint against Sam@@ sun@@ g Elec@@ tr@@ onic C@@ o L@@ t@@ d , H@@ T@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for a patent breach of the United States .
Ro@@ k@@ st@@ or is held jointly by Ap@@ ple , Micro@@ soft , Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , E@@ ric@@ sson and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of violating seven patents .
Pat@@ ents contain technologies that make it possible for advertising to be adver@@ tised on the Internet , have indicated the conclusions of the trial , which is the heart of Google .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ k@@ st@@ or .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and H@@ T@@ C are producing tele@@ phones operating under the Ang@@ ol@@ an operating system , which p@@ its fierce competition on Ap@@ ple and Micro@@ soft mobile products .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of USD 900 for Nor@@ tel patents .
Google has increased its offer several times , finally proposing $ 4.@@ 4 .
After losing the Nor@@ tel patents in the face of Ro@@ k@@ st@@ or , Google won Mo@@ tor@@ ola Mob@@ ility for a sum of USD 12.@@ 5 , a market in part based on Mo@@ tor@@ ola &apos;s patents .
&apos;@@ Even though it has failed in its attempt to acquire patents at auc@@ tion , Google has violated and continues to violate these patents &apos; , indicated the conclusions of the trial .
Ro@@ k@@ st@@ or calls for greater damage and interest against Google , because he claims that the violation of Google patents is stub@@ born , according to the complain@@ ant .
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion of a house in G@@ es@@ ves : a defec@@ tive water
The grand@@ mother had a cigarette in a gas le@@ ak .
The explosion of a housing in G@@ es@@ ves , which made two serious injuries on Friday morning , a grand@@ mother of 52 years and his grand@@ son of five years , was due to a gas flight from a defec@@ tive driver , indicated Friday evening the substitute for the Ro@@ i prosecutor .
The expert from the public prosecutor &apos;s office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely acci@@ dental .
The grand@@ mother s@@ ounded a cigarette when there was a flight and an accumulation of gas .
The vital prog@@ no@@ sis of the two victims is still committed .
The grand@@ mother was projected by the explosion and is being bur@@ nt down .
The little bo@@ y , who was resident in his grand@@ father and his compan@@ ion , was on his side and was bur@@ ned slightly .
&apos;@@ The two victims were in@@ tu@@ b@@ ated and long condi@@ tioned on the ground before being taken in the Li@@ Ã¨@@ ge of Li@@ Ã¨@@ ge , it hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , it was am@@ bul@@ ance &apos; , made the qu@@ ag@@ mire JosÃ© Paul@@ et , des@@ cen@@ ding on the scene .

Egypt \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s freely elected President
Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si l@@ ent the inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture of inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture , but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt .
The Islamist Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si promised the emergence of a &apos; new Egypt &apos; when he pre@@ ached the presidency of the presidency , thus becoming the first freely elected President and successor to H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak who was hun@@ ted out of power 16 months earlier .
In his inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture before the Constitutional Court , Mr Mor@@ si has also become the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ archy 60 years ago .
He l@@ ent to the Court &apos;s 18 black judge judges whose building on the N@@ ile was built to look like an Egyptian temp@@ le .
&apos;@@ We want a better future , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public &apos; , said President Mor@@ si during the sole@@ mn ceremony broadcast on public television .
&apos;@@ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom , true democracy and stability &apos; , explained Mr Mor@@ si , a 60 year old engine@@ er trained in the United States , from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been considered to be an illegal and hard-@@ pressed organisation by successive governments for over 84 years .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11 hours , a local hour , followed by a small con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred f@@ ans had gathered before the Court to acc@@ laim the new president and , de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation of the presidential agenda of the Mubarak years , traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his con@@ vo@@ ys to the very frequent streets linking the cen@@ tre@@ -@@ city to the southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
In view of the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood has been a little char@@ is@@ matic , its personal prestige has increased considerably since its victory and Friday &apos;s speech in which it tried to present itself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak .
&apos;@@ Egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional and modern state &apos; , said Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , in blue suits and red sw@@ aps , to the judges present in the bo@@ y room in which he was s@@ wor@@ n .
Lat@@ er , Mr Mor@@ si went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his inaug@@ ur@@ ation speech .
He was officially welcomed by a military fan@@ fare that played the national an@@ them when he was on the do@@ or@@ step .
The M@@ au@@ re@@ ch@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ i attended the ceremony .
When he arrived , he was ho@@ sted by the words &apos; the people and the army , hand in hand &apos; .
In 19@@ 08 and a former bas@@ tion of secular education , the University of Cairo became a fi@@ ef@@ er of Islamic students &apos; groups in the 1970s .
Mr Mor@@ si made a symbolic ser@@ tion on the Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square on Friday , hence the uprising that ended Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian regime last year , and he tried to recover the presidential powers of which the military council , which replaced the former President , de@@ fied him .
However , by agreeing to formally close before the Court , rather than before Parliament as it is used , it is ne@@ aring the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over .
Mr Mor@@ si &apos;s speech on Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gest@@ ures .

The three large De@@ tro@@ it manufacturers have double-@@ dig@@ it growth compared with October 2012 , but only General Mo@@ tors has done better than expected .
An@@ aly@@ sts had an average of 15@@ .@@ 4 million sales at an ann@@ u@@ alized rate and corrected seasonal variations , but the market was set at 15@@ .@@ 3 million according to the estimates of Adam J@@ on@@ as , an analy@@ st of Morgan Stan@@ ley .
In a note to the clients of the bank , he believes that this slight bra@@ ke is due primarily to &apos; the government sh@@ ut@@ down and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month &apos; .
However , G@@ M reported a rise of almost 16 % of its sales last month to 2@@ 26 4@@ 02 vehicles , compared with 2@@ 11 5@@ 63 expected by the consensus .
The four bran@@ ds of the group have seen their trade performance improve compared to October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit , among other things , from the success of its p@@ ick@@ -@@ ups , has seen its sales grow by 14 % over one year to 19@@ 1 9@@ 85 vehicles , while the consensus was 19@@ 4 30@@ 1 .
For its part , Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ler , controlled by Fi@@ at , announced a 11 % increase in sales to 140 0@@ 83 vehicles , compared with 14@@ 3 5@@ 36 .
To@@ y@@ ot@@ a and N@@ iss@@ an also show lower sales of the consensus , despite increases in one year of 8.@@ 8 % and 14@@ .@@ 2 % respectively .
On the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change , GM action was 1.@@ 4 % at 16@@ .@@ 35 G@@ M@@ T , while Ford gave up 1.@@ 1 % .
Rena@@ ult
Rena@@ ult acc@@ uses the largest drop in the S@@ B@@ F 120 index in Paris on Friday , after its N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor partner has announced that its annual net benefit forecast has fallen by almost 20 % .
N@@ iss@@ an , which had to carry out such a review , also announced a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling of its direction .
Several traders have reported that the Rena@@ ult action was affected this morning by &apos; learning &apos; .
&apos;@@ It is clearly the learning gain of N@@ iss@@ an &apos; , which is a person responsible for the trading of an Paris cour@@ ty@@ ard .
As part of the Rena@@ ult N@@ iss@@ an Alliance , Rena@@ ult holds 4@@ 3.@@ 4 % of N@@ iss@@ an &apos;s capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of the French , according to the N@@ iss@@ an website data .
Greece : two deaths in a sho@@ oting near a local neo-@@ Nazi party
Two people were killed , and another was seriously injured on Friday evening by sho@@ oting by two people who were on board a mo@@ to who was going to a local neo-@@ Nazi A@@ be party in the western sub@@ ur@@ bs of Athens , was taught from the police .
The police were not able to give information about the identity of victims and their possible political aff@@ ili@@ ation .
Some Greek media reported that members of Gol@@ den D@@ aw@@ Ã© had argued that the victims were local guards .
The injured person was immediately hosp@@ it@@ alised , depending on the same source .
The police officers of the anti-@@ terrorist service have been des@@ cen@@ ded on the central aven@@ ue of the sub@@ ur@@ b N@@ o Iraqi , where the incident took place and closed the area .
The incident takes place a few weeks after the indic@@ tment of six Members from Gol@@ den D@@ aw@@ n , whose party leader and foun@@ der , to participate in &apos; a criminal organisation &apos; in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-@@ fascist mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an by one of its members .

S@@ co@@ t Brown , the Cap@@ tain of C@@ el@@ ti@@ c G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w , has seen his rejected appeal and will be suspended for the next two matches of his club , against A@@ j@@ a@@ x and A@@ C Mil@@ an .
Ex@@ pe@@ lled against Bar@@ that for a coup d &apos;@@ Ã©@@ tat , the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three meetings by U@@ EF@@ A .
In a communi@@ qu@@ Ã© , his club said &apos; very disappointed &apos; , believing that his appeal was entirely justified .
Ne@@ arly 50 000 households are deprived of electricity on the whole province , shortly after mid@@ day on Friday , due to the violent win@@ ds affecting many regions along the St L@@ au@@ rent River .
The sectors most affected are the L@@ au@@ ren@@ ti@@ ans with 15 0@@ 42 subscri@@ bers plun@@ ged into the black , Mon@@ ten@@ governed with 13 4@@ 64 and the O@@ u@@ ta@@ ese with 8@@ 6@@ 42 .
The large Mon@@ tre@@ al region also has a lot of pan@@ els with almost 7@@ 000 private households in the me@@ tro@@ pol@@ la and L@@ av@@ al .
You thought that the travel agents were in the past because of the Internet ?
F@@ ine Centre seems to reverse the trend .
Society has revised its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results thanks to the ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying profit on the whole exercise between USD 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 before taxes , against a previous forecast of USD 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 M .
If current forecasts are met , it will represent 12 to 17 % of growth compared with the record benefit of USD 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 in 2011 / 12 .
The Director General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ li@@ ght Centre had made 8 % of the profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly as regards travel other than business tri@@ ps in Australia and the United Kingdom .
&apos;@@ Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are on the right track to achieve record results on the whole exercise before deduc@@ ting interest and taxes &apos; , he said .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits .
In Australia , the rec@@ rea@@ tional travel sector has been re@@ kin@@ d@@ led during the second half of the year , which made it possible to compensate for a small domestic market in business tri@@ ps .
Similarly , in the United Kingdom , the F@@ li@@ h@@ t-@@ Centre leisure sector has performed well , while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States has recovered its losses during the first half of the year in which seasonal demand is lower and should benefit the whole exercise for the third time in a row .
The actions of F@@ air@@ t Centre have increased by 3 c@@ ents to USD 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
In@@ no@@ vations are on a ho@@ tel near the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid .
In@@ no@@ vative in@@ m@@ ates opened the fire this Friday on a ho@@ tel close to the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid in Egypt without any victims , as a result of an apparent dispute with redundant workers .
The murde@@ rers took the flight , said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , the police General Ab@@ del L@@ . .
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has almost no tourist ever since the army de@@ posed the Islamic President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si at the beginning of July and re@@ pres@@ ses the protests of his supporters .

In the course of the English literature courses , pupils will have to study at least a piece of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic po@@ em and a contemporary British fic@@ tion of 19@@ 14 .
The review will also present &apos; new texts &apos; to encourage a more diverse reading .
A combination of literature and English language will be removed .
From 2015 , pupils will have to pass an independent G@@ C@@ SE , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education must publish its new programmes in English and m@@ a@@ the@@ s tomorrow - the first materials to undergo radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the regulator of the exam@@ inations , will dis@@ close a overhaul of the G@@ CC structure , with a new rating system and less course .
Speaking in the summer , Mic@@ hael Go@@ ve , Minister of Education , said that there was a &apos; broad consensus on the need to reform our exam@@ inations to restore public confidence &apos; , insisting that the G@@ CC would be &apos; more stimulating , more ambitious and more rigorous &apos; .
Stu@@ dies show that English schools spend less time on m@@ a@@ th@@ s ( 1@@ 16 hours per year , or 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
In comparison , the Austr@@ ali@@ an schools offer an average of 14@@ 3 hours per year , and the Singapore pupils make about 13@@ 8 hours .
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the use of time to m@@ a@@ the@@ s , the sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the G@@ C@@ A of deep m@@ a@@ th@@ ies - as well as the greater importance given to matters in international ran@@ kings - would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours .
The programme will put more emphasis on &apos; real world problems &apos; , including financial mathema@@ tics .
This judgment means that a text of law adopted in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .

The ex-@@ G@@ est@@ ap@@ o leader buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery
MÃ¼@@ ller , who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without any trace of it , was in fact buried in a common fo@@ cal point of a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in Berlin , asser@@ ting the leader of the German resistance M@@ em@@ orial , Professor Johann@@ es Tu@@ ch@@ el , in Bil@@ d .
MÃ¼@@ ller did not survive at the end of the war .
&apos;@@ His body was buried in 1945 in a mass gra@@ b of the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Mit@@ te &apos; , he assured a great deal on a daily basis based on archi@@ ve documents .
This re@@ vel@@ ation , 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , would be one of the great myster@@ ies of the war after war .
The German secret services , the B@@ N@@ D , ensured that , in the summer of 19@@ 49 , MÃ¼@@ ller was in Kar@@ lo@@ v@@ ly V@@ ary , then in Cz@@ echo@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ akia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
The secret services were completely wrong .
&apos;@@ Since August 1945 , the body of MÃ¼@@ ller was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Re@@ ich of the Re@@ ich by a comm@@ o &apos; , according to Mr Tu@@ ch@@ el .
It referred to &apos; a uniform standard &apos; .
In the left poc@@ ket , in particular , there was a photo@@ grap@@ h .
Bil@@ d also publ@@ ishes a paper from the town of Mit@@ te in Berlin , which states that it was buried in the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in the area .
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany , Di@@ ter Gr@@ au@@ mann , was shocked by this re@@ vel@@ ation .
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sad@@ es is buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery is a huge dis@@ taste .
&apos;@@ There is a great deal of foot for the victims &apos; .
He@@ in@@ rich MÃ¼@@ ller is one of the important person@@ alities of the Third Re@@ ich who have never been caught .
He took part in the W@@ ann@@ e conference in January 19@@ 42 , which decided on the &apos; final solution &apos; and , in particular , in his orders A@@ dol@@ f E@@ ich@@ mann , who was responsible for the &apos; logistics &apos; of the ex@@ termination of Jews , condemned to death and executed in Israel in 196@@ 2 .

It works in the mu@@ d , the jung@@ le and cross rivers to offer free medical assistance free of charge
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le dis@@ covers free healthcare in Cam@@ ero@@ on villages
Dr B@@ ow@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend to see hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country , barely 1 % of the population .
Vo@@ te here or via your mobile machinery
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le is one of the 10 H@@ er@@ os C@@ N@@ N of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the other 10 her@@ oes , to elect H@@ Ã©r@@ os C@@ N@@ N of the year .
This person will receive USD 250 000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le watched his ill father alter@@ n@@ ating times of conscience and in@@ conscience and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James B@@ w@@ le was injured in a car accident in 198@@ 1 near Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ Ã© , the capital of Cam@@ ero@@ on .
At the beginning , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted an infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ging whose consequences he was going to carry the rest of his life .
&apos;@@ There was no neuro@@ sur@@ gical in Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos; , said Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ . .
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money .
Instead , Dr B@@ ow@@ she spent years supporting his father in crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , so that he gets any treatment that he could enjoy .
&apos;@@ It is not easy &apos; , adding Mr B@@ ow@@ it .
You can leave the house at 5 : you are going to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they are waiting for too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr B@@ ow@@ it &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on there is only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
Even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ on could not pay for consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditure is carried out in the private sector .
&apos;@@ The only problem they have , it is poverty &apos; , has explained Dr B@@ ow@@ le .
And because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
Having seen his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ riots suffering , Dr B@@ w@@ it was determined to try to change the course .
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le and his voluntary team have carried out more than 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge during last year .
He has become a doctor himself , working as a v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar sur@@ ge@@ on at the central hospital in Y@@ a@@ ound@@ Ã© .
It has created a non-@@ profit humanitarian association , SA@@ CO@@ W , which goes to rural areas during week@@ ends to provide free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32 000 people .
Almost every Friday , with thirty people , they are p@@ ouring into rub@@ b@@ ish after fixing the medical equipment on the ro@@ of and going through difficult land to go to the villages most in need .
The chance does not always follow .
They have often had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or mu@@ d routes .
But when they arrive , they are received as her@@ oes : the community organis@@ es a f@@ es@@ ti@@ val , d@@ an@@ cing and d@@ ance and offers them the best available housing .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and Dr B@@ w@@ it - with its great s@@ miles and energy - is more than happy to join the cele@@ bra@@ tions .
The next morning , the team is beginning to receive hundreds of patients .
&apos;@@ We get 500 people on each visit &apos; , said Mr B@@ . .
Sometimes they live at 60 km from the village , and they are coming up .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is provided .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive b@@ ad@@ ges , a gl@@ asses of gl@@ asses collected or a free birth certificate - a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
This evening , the practical team of simple sur@@ gical acts under local an@@ a@@ es@@ thetic .
The operations are generally carried out in a school , a ma@@ ster@@ y or a house ; after intervention , the patient rose and went to the aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the elec@@ tro@@ gen group , the operation room and the ster@@ il@@ isation of equipment , Dr B@@ ow@@ l and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
It is a fe@@ e@@ ble rate , but the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans of villages generally help the team to remain motivated .
&apos;@@ They are kno@@ cking on rub@@ b@@ res all night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work &apos; .
On Sunday , the team is returning to city , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , made up of Cam@@ ero@@ on doctors and medical students , has carried out 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the last year , and he knows that their presence can make a difference to those who are helping .
A man explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a her@@ d would allow him to work again .
&apos;@@ This will change my future and that of my family &apos; , said man .
In addition to making this travelling hospital live and working as sur@@ ge@@ on in hospital , Dr B@@ w@@ le is also working at night in private medical firms around Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ Ã© .
It is this second job , it says , which finances 60 % of its association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&apos;@@ I do not know when he is d@@ orm@@ ant &apos; , he said K@@ ati@@ m O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a medical student in the second year of the D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a and volunte@@ er in the Dr B@@ ow@@ le Group .
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
For medical students and nur@@ sing students such as K@@ ati@@ m O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr B@@ ow@@ it in his missions , it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home .
&apos;@@ You have been able to take part in operations to help em@@ ul@@ ate blood or pass the instruments to Dr B@@ w@@ le &apos; , explained M@@ iss O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are medical student in the second year .
Volun@@ tary students generally pay their journey to Cam@@ ero@@ on , and often arrive with the medical material collected .
But once in Y@@ a@@ ound@@ Ã© , their pensions , transport and education are borne by Dr B@@ ow@@ le .
&apos;@@ It is a her@@ o , there is no doubt &apos; , he said K@@ ati@@ m O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the people of Cam@@ ero@@ on is not close to extinc@@ tion .
For Dr Blue , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ ping others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy .
&apos;@@ I am so happy when I do that &apos; , added Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
En@@ suring people and allevi@@ ating the pain are the reasons why I do that .
Take the SA@@ CO@@ W site to see how you help .
The two France of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a
The aca@@ demics have long been pain@@ ted to define and place Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a .
Is it the case that there is a f@@ law in amp@@ hi@@ theat@@ res and rooms ?
Without doubt , but by under@@ lining the weak for the roads , S@@ ic@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , the High E@@ u@@ ds .
Ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ous of works from others in his office in the G@@ as@@ ton@@ -@@ G@@ alli@@ mar@@ d street ?
Indeed , while ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publ@@ ish@@ er .
De@@ ar of the fur@@ y that occup@@ ies the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t cannot replace the real ho@@ ly oil , that of the theory , which has happened .
They have will@@ ingly recognised in him as a great spar@@ se , a lively and a feder@@ ator of their work , but pointing out that he was unwilling to produce himself .
In this uncertain image the monu@@ ment of the &apos; L@@ ess@@ ons &apos; , to which he has attached his name , has also contributed .
The bad languages were able to see a gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic market in the chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with a vi@@ br@@ ant gl@@ ance and le@@ ver@@ aged , but incur@@ ably Lat@@ vian .
The two books published by Nor@@ a almost two years ago have already established that the one who was going to do not write had a lot and a lot written .
The book that is now should be brought to justice .
Once again , however , there is the temptation of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , of an intellectual v@@ ag@@ age , of the ju@@ bil@@ ation that has been b@@ lown up as a matter of course .
But it is easy to understand that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered in this book to such a fine title bring the bu@@ ck to a single passion : to discover the constitu@@ tive no@@ se of French identity .
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity ?
I@@ d@@ entity : it is a concern of the times .
We have been collectively invited to give a definition .
However , in the per@@ sever@@ ance of our leaders at that time , the French identity was an in@@ viol@@ able petrol .
Ac@@ ci@@ dents should only be deployed , and the case , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism , has to be given to the pre@@ fec@@ ts and sub@@ ser@@ ts , authorised interpreters .
This is something that Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a &apos;s tra@@ il is about .
It is not a he@@ ir of an e@@ ternal dec@@ e@@ it , it is refusing to define it .
He is concerned about a family str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he is a forest of symbols , arrested at every step by a bus object , with irrit@@ ating questions .
Is it the job of the company itself : why , in a country that is so long inst@@ alled in its borders , which were formerly co@@ ver@@ tly char@@ tered and united , is these dramatic calls for unity ?
They are so pressing , suggest Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , that in order to con@@ j@@ ure up the troub@@ les born out of French history .
Fran@@ cs and G@@ au@@ ts , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ach and Bour@@ gu@@ ign@@ ons , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the forces of division here are very old .
The most emb@@ le@@ matic is , of course , the one in two national history .
From the earthquake of the Revolution , the French have two histor@@ ies and they have two nations , a mon@@ arch@@ ical one , the other revolutionary .
The second wanted the death of the first , but without being able to deny it ; instead , it was about finding the sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t and all the more gre@@ en@@ er of unity and indi@@ visibility that it had cut its head to the one that was the obvious and powerful embo@@ di@@ ment .
And , of course , an inv@@ inci@@ bly bin@@ ary nation , shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , ad@@ h@@ ering and hatred of revolution .
In order to make this unique of French identity , nothing is worth the four steps out of H@@ exagger@@ one , so that Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a &apos;s American cl@@ oud may well be the heart of his book .
After all , America and France have a revolution , written a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
However , the American k@@ ick@@ -@@ off is only doing better to highlight what is our own .
There are men who left their An@@ ci@@ an region in England and no longer had to worry about it .
Here , there are men who are crow@@ ded with an indigenous , and even more radical , An@@ ci@@ an Region .
This is a consensu@@ al revolution when it has s@@ owed the drama and trust .
Here the founding fathers who are always honoured , and here are revolutionary anc@@ estors whose models are hard to make , and who have been left with the death penalty .
This is an institutional agreement , and here there is a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitutions , as so many errors to be made up and tested .
France , which is now coming ,
However , there was a time when the French believed that they could rec@@ ou@@ p the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of their history and overcome the cur@@ se of the figure .
In this Third Republic , which is a central and creative one , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a has shown a great deal of interest and even ten@@ acity : sal@@ u@@ ting those who then employed to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching school@@ children everything in the former France , in spite of the fact that modern France was still preparing for a unified version of their history .
But this peaceful identity has had only one time .
This is once again in the debate , which is being driven by immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of the res@@ ale minorities , which are absor@@ bed in the European area .
The book therefore offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ it of France and the circum@@ spec@@ t of France that is coming .
On top of that , the picture of the histor@@ ian , which should set aside some sur@@ prises .
It is discovered that the journey was a ca@@ ke .
The man of multiple cu@@ o@@ si@@ ties turned , slightly obs@@ es@@ sively , around the same idea .
The role of read@@ ers was at the centre of the centre .
And the one who , more than half a century ago , tabled a subject on the idea of nation , but had taken away from the initial exercise of the theory , hand us , cu@@ me s@@ ali@@ us , that he will end up doing .
Of course , in a less reason@@ ed , more fragmented and sub@@ tle form .
But let us not dec@@ eive ourselves , just as binding .
Because much more than the figure imposed on university curricul@@ a , this th@@ row@@ s the internal necessity of a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &apos; The return is quite complex to manage &apos; .
En@@ d in Be@@ ir@@ ut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; team who visited a H@@ iz@@ bollah demonstration , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released almost 21 months later , 27 November 1987 .
Re@@ treated since 2008 , he took part in the creation of the &apos; O@@ ut@@ come &apos; defence association in 2004 , which he has been cha@@ iring for several years .
Its main objective is to gain the opportunity for the hostages to complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .

As early as the evening of your release , you were on the 20th of &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
In particular , in Be@@ ir@@ ut .
When I am released , I find myself in the co@@ ff@@ er of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ que .
He tells me &apos; you are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and tell me that we can still be killed .
We are very exc@@ ited , but very tense too .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They are putting us on the edge .

I have come back and there is full .
The down@@ gra@@ ding of the flight of the plane , the re@@ union with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely emotional .
Between the airport and my home , many motor@@ cycles follow our car that R@@ cus@@ h@@ er leads .
The motor@@ ists are pul@@ ling out to make photo@@ graph@@ s and follow me up to my home where I have to do a bit of the police to stop some of them .
Media pressure is enormous .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fa@@ ti@@ gue is such that it is difficult to see it .
There is a hole and we are suddenly under the media .
It is a little complicated , a little violent , rather complex to manage .
But we have done the hardest .
I myself am at 20@@ th , the next day I am on the television .
Then there is a sort of adaptation to life , very slowly , for one or two months that are a little like holidays .
How did medical exam@@ inations and the D@@ G@@ SE deal have gone ?
I had the right to first medical control in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The remain@@ der was made in the V@@ al-@@ de facto days of my return : radio , exam@@ inations of all kinds and meeting with a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that you can count on it , that it is so necessary , that we are not left to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostages .
That was logical .
I was not embarr@@ assed .
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Ni@@ ger ?
I am listening to what is said .
The debate on ran@@ so@@ m in particular .
Some things irrit@@ ate me , others less .
I am trying to do the part between the questions on my past as a hostage and my h@@ at as President of the &apos; O@@ ge of the World &apos; association , which allows me to distance myself , and I think it is far more interesting to talk .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Above all , I am fighting , together with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostage .
In my opinion , there is a problem of sem@@ an@@ tics .
The taking of hostages &apos; political hostages &apos; - which is most of the time - must be called the hostages and allow the hostages to have access to justice , complain and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in comp@@ as@@ sion , in emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice ?
A court in The Hague is doing this .
Why do you not say to the hostages &apos; hostages &apos; you have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of war , such as those of all the Geneva conventions , you will be brought to justice ? &apos;
I think that is justified , legitimate and struck in common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and I am shocked .
This is my main fight .
Egyptian Islamists
The anger in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists .
Two days before opening the trial of the war@@ -@@ torn President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
mobilisation throughout Egypt to call for the restoration of the country &apos;s first democratically elected president .
It is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood milit@@ ant .
Until now , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the documents .
This is not a trial , it is a far@@ ce .
President Mor@@ si &apos;s trial is a false trial , which is a pro-@@ Mor@@ si , and he is supposed to have tried S@@ is@@ i , not the opposite .
Mor@@ si must judge S@@ is@@ i for the massacres in R@@ ab@@ a , the N@@ ah@@ da massacres , and the Republican Gu@@ ard massacre .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
clashes erup@@ ted in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police used te@@ ar gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 polic@@ emen will be deployed in the Cairo Police A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , where Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si will be judged .
H@@ ag@@ el blam@@ es 9 States
Since the federal state recognised homosexual marriage , &apos; all military spouses have a right to an identity card of the Department of Defence and to the benefits that come with &apos; , recalled the minister in New York in a speech in the An@@ tic@@ -@@ D@@ ef@@ am@@ ation League against anti-Semitism .
&apos;@@ But some states refuse to issue these cards to the sa@@ me-@@ sex partners in the National Gu@@ ard facilities &apos; , he denounced , blam@@ ing these states for violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases , or access their shops .
The Secretary of Defence has said that he has ordered the Chief Gu@@ ard , General Fran@@ k G@@ ass , to ensure that the federal law is implemented .
The head of the nine states began with the T@@ ex@@ as , which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the T@@ ex@@ tile National Gu@@ ard , due to a conflict between the T@@ ex@@ tile Act and the federal law on homosexual marriage .
It was joined in its refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Mis@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , Car@@ ol@@ ine and Western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defence officer .
The Pen@@ tag@@ on estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to around 5@@ 600 active people , 17 000 by including the National Gu@@ ard , the reserve and pensioners .

The May@@ or of Tor@@ onto hun@@ t for journalists on a drugs case
In Canada , the May@@ or of Tor@@ onto is suspected of d@@ row@@ ning , according to several media .
A video handed to justice seems to support these suspic@@ ions .

On Thursday , he hun@@ ted from his ownership of several journalists who came to ask him .

A case of rage detected at a c@@ at in the V@@ al-@@ de O@@ ise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of ra@@ b@@ ies had been detected in a ch@@ at@@ on in the V@@ al-@@ de O@@ ise , obviously of foreign origin , while France is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed from indigenous cases since 2001 .
The ch@@ at@@ on was found on 25 October in Ar@@ g@@ ren@@ e@@ he and died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of ra@@ b@@ ies was confirmed by the P@@ ast@@ er Institute .
&apos;@@ An epide@@ mi@@ ological investigation has been undertaken in order to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this ch@@ at@@ on between 8 October and 28 October , including , &apos; specifies the ministries of health and agriculture .
&apos;@@ Five people who have been in contact with the ch@@ at@@ on have already been identified &apos; and have received preventive treatment .
&apos;@@ C@@ ome on man , the preventive treatment of human ra@@ b@@ ies , administered after contact with the por@@ der animal , but before the symptoms appear , is very effective &apos; , and it says the communi@@ qu@@ Ã© .
The ministries are now calling on people who would have been killed , beaten , abduc@@ ted , or l@@ acked on a mut@@ iny or on a skin damaged by that ch@@ at@@ on or whose animal would have been in contact with that ch@@ at@@ on between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0@@ 8.@@ 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 00@@ 6.@@ 95 between 10 hours and 6 hours from 1 November .
&apos;@@ France has been free from ra@@ b@@ ies since 2001 , this ch@@ at@@ on or mother was imported from another country , not un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed &apos; , according to the communi@@ qu@@ Ã© .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last &apos; indigenous &apos; case of ra@@ b@@ ies dates back to December 1998 on a fo@@ x and that &apos; France is declared officially un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed of this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for Animal Health ( O@@ I@@ E ) &apos; .
A case of ra@@ b@@ ies on an illegally imported Chil@@ ean Chile was recorded in 2008 .
&apos;@@ R@@ ies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time &apos; , remind ministries and it is trans@@ missible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama &apos;s reform of the health system
In an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday to his un@@ ambiguously and often repeated promise that &apos; if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it &apos; .
After hundreds of thousands of people have received statements of resili@@ ence from their providers , the Republic@@ ans have criticised the President in the last few days by acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
&apos;@@ The vast majority of people who have a health insurance that suits them can keep it &apos; , he said in a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
When it comes to what it calls &apos; the current news &apos; on the issue of residues , President Obama has encouraged the Americans to take these views to seek new insurance on the market .
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health systems for the same price , or even less expensive than expected .
&apos;@@ You will win &apos; , he said .
The administration has announced that we should not be surprised if the 5 % of the population who are making their own insurance felt forced to change regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act .
&apos;@@ Let me address the Americans directly : you deserve better &apos; , said K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us when he testi@@ fies to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who over@@ sees the implementation of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act , has indicated that the launch of the online market in October had failed &apos; mis@@ erably &apos; .
&apos;@@ I am as frustrated and irrit@@ ated as anyone else &apos; has added .
I look forward to reg@@ ain@@ ing your confidence .
It was a K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated who made this sentence , when she believed his micro@@ phone was cut off , addressing an assist@@ ant sitting behind her at the sitting of yesterday &apos;s Assembly following an exchange of contentious points of view with B@@ ill@@ y L@@ ong , a Republican representative of M@@ iss@@ our@@ i , to know whether she should join the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
For more than three hours , B@@ ill@@ ly L@@ ong repeatedly urged Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us why &apos; the architec@@ t &apos; of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act had not voluntarily renoun@@ ced the government &apos;s sponsored insurance to subscribe to a regime via He@@ al@@ th@@ Car@@ e@@ .@@ go@@ v , which it is now v@@ ying to millions of Americans .
T@@ ow@@ ards a special ca@@ p to Abu D@@ hab@@ i
The happy election , J@@ ei@@ ke Vic@@ te P@@ re@@ ko@@ p , has combined the col@@ ours of the car mark and the German flag , while incorporating the concepts of speed and heat at the level of the run@@ way .
The German Se@@ bas@@ ti@@ an V@@ et@@ tel , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ ple champion of the world of For@@ mul@@ a 1 , has been tr@@ acked for the free tests of the Gr@@ and Pri@@ x of Abu D@@ hab@@ i on Friday a special cas@@ s@@ que whose design was carried out by a 21 year Mexican f@@ an .
This has chosen 1 500 design@@ s from all over the world , as part of a competition launched by one of the spons@@ ors , a car brand and its st@@ ays .
He was invited to follow the G@@ P of Abu D@@ hab@@ i , with a friend , and can therefore look closely at the German champion , on the path and in his s@@ cri@@ pt .
It was intended to wear this ca@@ p on Friday and Saturday , to test .
He is likely to have another special cas@@ s@@ que on Sunday , for the race to mark his 4@@ th con@@ secu@@ tive world title .
An A@@ ber@@ vi@@ li@@ o
Let us not be mistaken .
In the spirit of Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , his foun@@ der , the &apos; sub@@ urban Party &apos; is not just addressed to the ban@@ ds .
I have chosen a card of France as a lo@@ go , justifies it .
When I talk about sub@@ ur@@ bs , I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , his draft , presented on Thursday at the press conference in Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ li@@ m@@ o , was born out of the desire to better defend multicul@@ tur@@ alism , this great cultural po@@ t that character@@ ises the areas .
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multicul@@ tur@@ alism .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , 50 years , a territorial att@@ achment , is now claiming to be &apos; 100 % a@@ political &apos; even though it has not always been neutral .
In 2002 , alongside Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ in , he then supported locally Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if the right-wing people are prepared to support me , I will listen to them too .
There are only extremist parties .
In addition to multicul@@ tur@@ alism , Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine has built its consul@@ tancy programme on Inter@@ net@@ - on many issues that are supposed to speak to the inhabitants of sub@@ ur@@ bs and , in particular , to young people : the right to vote for foreigners , leg@@ alization of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , the civilian majority to 16 years , the restoration of the function of guardian of buildings ...
There is still a need to find candidates to form lists and to defend their ideas on the political scene &apos; , for the 2014 municipal elections , it is likely to be fair , he agrees &apos; .
It is a matter of time and money .
The sub@@ urban Party should nevertheless be represented in Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ l@@ as through my candi@@ d@@ acy and I also hope in other cities .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine has already had seven heads of the list in me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an France and Mart@@ ini@@ que .
&apos;@@ And the meag@@ re support that I have received since yesterday was not all of sub@@ ur@@ bs &apos; .
John Ker@@ ry admitted , unprecedented , that American es@@ pion@@ age had gone too far .
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a weakening of the United States &apos; defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes by ad@@ mitting , unprecedented , that , on several occasions , es@@ pion@@ age &apos; has gone too far &apos; .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , was governed by an &apos; automatic pilot &apos; when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations by the whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about the N@@ SA sp@@ ying activities came about .
The lea@@ ks have put the US Government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London in video liaison , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &apos; It is undeniable that the President , myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things automatic pilot because we had the opportunity , from the Second World War and to the difficult years of the Cold War , and then , of course , 11 September . &apos;
He then became the first senior member of the United States Government to admit that American sp@@ ying had gone beyond the bounds , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : &apos; In some cases it has gone too far . &apos;
And the President is resolved to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for the good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
He added : &apos; We live in a new world where people are prepared to get caught up . &apos;
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , to blow them up and to attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they act ?
We have actually prevented aircraft from falling , building buildings and people to be murdered because we have been able to get to know the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will go to Europe to respond to the concerns about the alleged American es@@ pion@@ age affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States , explained on Thursday the President of the Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y of the Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut said that he had spoken to the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the feeling of frustration that the National Security Agency is under .
&apos;@@ It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism &apos; , said Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first term , and President of the Sub@@ committee on European Affairs of the US Senate , in an interview from Washington .
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the N@@ SA programmes .
The press reports that the N@@ SA has cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which has undermined relations with some US allies , however , the director of the agency said this week that it was wrong and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about me@@ tal that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations have reported that the N@@ SA had inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and that of 34 other heads of state .
The Director of Int@@ elli@@ gent Services , James C@@ l@@ enti@@ er , justified the es@@ pion@@ age of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides .
In this atmosphere of tu@@ mul@@ t , Mur@@ ph@@ y indicated that his office had a trip from Congress , which is due to take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days .
He said that the route remains to be defined .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the aim of this journey was to make it possible to improve relations , but also to show &apos; affec@@ tive firm@@ ness &apos; .
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of sp@@ ying programmes they have been applying for years .
&apos;@@ We can change our surveillance programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to sp@@ y on es@@ pion@@ age &apos; , said Mur@@ ph@@ y .
In the meantime , Mr Ker@@ ry has planned to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the ran@@ so@@ m generated by US strategies in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as by US surveillance activities .
The London stock exchange ended on Thursday , over@@ shad@@ owed by the poor results of S@@ hell and the day after the Fed announced its support for the economy as planned .
An Austr@@ ali@@ an
One of the 21 years in Sy@@ d@@ ney , sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et for wrongly alleged to have been attacked by a tax@@ i driver , appe@@ aled to the judgment and was put under the car@@ pet .
Ste@@ life Ro@@ ch@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first found guilty by a Court of Pro@@ v@@ ince in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et on 15 June of false statements after telling the Tha@@ i police that a local tax@@ i driver , together with two other men who had control , attacked him on Sunday 10 June .
However , video record@@ ings later revealed that she had returned to her ho@@ tel safely after he was separated from his little Austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
The P@@ hu@@ k@@ et police asked B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she admitted to have invented the history of all parts .
It was held in a unit of the local authority prior to the hearing before the court .
B@@ am@@ ford was sentenced to a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a low-@@ safety detention centre in the P@@ hu@@ k@@ u periphery rather than in a prison for women .
It is the daughter of the former player of the Austr@@ ali@@ an League of ru@@ g@@ by Peter Tun@@ ks , who appe@@ aled to the Foreign Ministry of Can@@ ber@@ ra to help his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told the Sunday Te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h of Sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was &apos; extremely concerned &apos; about the welfare of his daughter and wanted it to go to Australia .
&apos;@@ We have of course experienced a worrying moment , but we hope to bring it back to the house as soon as possible &apos; , said Tun@@ ks .
B@@ am@@ ford referred to the judgment and was put in freedom after the payment of 50 000 ba@@ h@@ s .
In Australia , the press said that , in the meantime , it was on holiday in the K@@ ra@@ bi region , south of Thailand .
Tha@@ i judicial sources have indicated that B@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local lawyer in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et , but warned that the call could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison .
However , after the recent murder in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et of Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith , an Austr@@ ali@@ an trip , Thailand could also seek to re@@ kin@@ dle its deteriorating image with tourists , which could lead to an acqu@@ it@@ tal .
The French police will stop the supporters of Andersson who have come to the end of the R@@ S@@ C@@ A .

&apos;@@ The bus con@@ vo@@ ys will be es@@ cor@@ ted by the police from a former border post in Re@@ ke@@ m until the P@@ S@@ G stage &apos; has passed the spokesman .
It will be the same for return .
&apos;@@ If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris with other means , the French police pre@@ fec@@ ture has made it known that measures have been taken to make arrests or guards to be held &apos; , yet Mari@@ e Ver@@ be@@ ke has announced that .
Li@@ ving together in French ,
In the case of the Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ teen@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ ys , 62 % of pupils have a mother tongue other than French .
This was the reason a year ago for consultation with parents , pupils , prof@@ essors and members of education staff to think about how to better integrate the pupils who live in the horse between several cultures .
The school committee has just revealed its vision of &apos; Li@@ ving together in French &apos; .
The Di@@ versity of Di@@ versity has been promoted for a year in schools to help pupils from all origins to find common benchmarks that are not confined to the French language .
The discovery of areas , our architecture , our places are benchmarks .
Lar@@ ge names of writ@@ ers , artists , whether they are can@@ ned or come from elsewhere .
Who are our buil@@ ders ?
&apos;@@ So we create projects in such a way that they identify with all of this &apos; , explains the President of V@@ ision diversity , A@@ ia K@@ am@@ ar .
Michel V@@ an , the New World Institute , identified several challenges for the school committee .
&apos;@@ On the transmission , for example , of the qu@@ e@@ ue culture , the sense of belonging , support for staff in the trans@@ forma@@ tions that we are living in , within the student cli@@ ent &apos; .
The Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -@@ Bo@@ ge@@ ge@@ ys school committee has set up a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who , sometimes , come from elsewhere .
