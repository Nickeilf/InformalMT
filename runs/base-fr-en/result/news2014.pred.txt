The S@@ pec@@ tr@@ um
The sport@@ s@@ woman , J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lor@@ ez , mar@@ ched a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter over Bo@@ go@@ ta , the Colombian capital .
With a w@@ in-@@ win ( a combination of love ) , it went to 160 km / h above the notorious Mon@@ ser@@ ram@@ ite sanc@@ tu@@ ary , located at more than 3 000 metres of al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ ges had gathered to observe its fe@@ at .
A black box in your car ?
While the pl@@ ann@@ ers of the United States &apos; road network find it difficult to find the money needed to repair the motor@@ way motor@@ way infrastructure , there are many who see a solution in the form of a small black box that is set above the scoreboard of your car .
The appli@@ ances , which record all the miles of a motor@@ ist and trans@@ mit information to officials , are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the planning government offices to re@@ design the obsolete system of financing the main US roads .
The sector usually without interest in the planning of major a@@ xes has suddenly provoked a lively debate and heated alliances .
The liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined green groups to press for the government to use small bo@@ xes to keep track of the miles that you , and possibly the road on which you are circul@@ ating , then use the information to draft a tax bill .
The Te@@ a Party is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And , while Cong@@ res@@ sional members cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
They are looking for how , over the next decade , they can move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of motor@@ ists have already embarked on these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with a G@@ PS monitoring system , for an experimental vice .
This is absolutely essential for our nation .
‘ It is not as if we had the choice ’ , said H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ ra@@ ta , Director-General of the Sou@@ ther@@ n California Association of Go@@ ver@@ ine , which states that the state will start to record the miles travelled by each California motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the country ’ s Hi@@ gh@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund , financed with the taxes that the Americans pay to the p@@ ump , is financially .
Americans are no longer buying as much petrol as before .
C@@ ars can travel more miles with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are reluctant to increase tax , even 1 % , while petrol prices are high .
&apos;@@ The petrol tax is simply not sustainable &apos; , said Le@@ e M@@ un@@ n@@ ich , a specialist in transport policy at the University of Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
Its state has recently set up trac@@ es of 500 cars to test a system of payment for miles .
“ This is the most logical alternative in the long term , ” he said .
W@@ on@@ ks are calling for the cost of using them per kilome@@ tre .
It is not surprising that the idea of the city of the city is that it is a matter of se@@ duc@@ tive liberals , since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system as they draw up strategies to achieve the goals set out in the ambitious state laws on global warming .
But the representative of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives , Bill Bill S@@ us@@ ter , said that he also regarded him as the most viable alternative in the long term .
The free-@@ market supporters of the Re@@ a@@ sia Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay .
&quot; This is not just a tax on a large black hole , &quot; said A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , Vice-President of politics at the Re@@ a@@ sia Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits they are given .
The movement is also supported by two former US secre@@ tar@@ ies in Transport , who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to go down the path of payment .
The US Senate approved a pilot project of 90 M last year , which would have been about 10 000 cars .
But the presidency of the House killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural law@@ makers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or town .
Several states and large cities nonetheless make progress on their side .
The most determined is O@@ reg@@ on , which has mobili@@ zed 5 000 drivers to carry out the country &apos;s most important experience .
These motor@@ ists will soon pay the state for kil@@ ome@@ tric costs instead of petrol taxes .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City is considering one .
Il@@ lin@@ is is trying to test a limited number of lorries .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the US coast ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) is looking into how to implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where around 50 voluntary car drivers recently f@@ itted their car , drivers were worried that the government would be able to follow their che@@ apest and gest@@ ures .
“ The concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther , and this kind of thing are a big problem , ” said Al@@ ud@@ din K@@ han , who leads the strategic management of performance at the Trans@@ ports Department of the N@@ ev@@ ada .
That is not something that people want .
From the beginning of the trial , the N@@ ev@@ ada N@@ ev@@ ada was warning on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into a fully-@@ fledged location . ”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep people &apos;s record record and daily .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is one of the few states that are now moving to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car is running , but without knowing the place or the exact time .
If we can do that , then added K@@ han , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-@@ up of California for the name of Tr@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes on the Member States .
It sought to pene@@ tr@@ ate the emerging market in au@@ to insurance , in which drivers would pay according to their kilome@@ tre .
But the appli@@ ances that it is testing have pl@@ anted the pl@@ ann@@ ers of major a@@ xes because they do not use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , perio@@ dic@@ ally down@@ loaded .
‘ People will be more inclined to do that if you do not record their speed and do not loc@@ ate them ’ , said R@@ yan Mor@@ ris@@ on , Director-General of Tr@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
Lar@@ ge errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some Member States .
There are far cheaper means and much less intru@@ sive methods of proceeding .
In O@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers are trying to experience the experiment by offering the drivers different choices .
They can choose an aircraft with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have anything at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing aircraft to do more , rather than not enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials seek to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for par@@ king fees , provide &apos; payment for driving &apos; and create a set of data on real speed from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid congestion .
&apos;@@ The car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the advantages of the system &apos; , indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some of the transport pl@@ ann@@ ers are asking whether the whole debate on the payment of mine is not simply a huge di@@ version .
In the Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an Transport Commission Commission in the San Franc@@ is@@ co Bay area , those responsible say that Congress could very simply manage the High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund ’ s bankruptcy by increasing petrol taxes .
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol , so everyone pays their fair share .
‘ There is no need to resort to radical sur@@ ger@@ y when we simply need aspir@@ in ’ , said that the director of the legislation and of public affairs in the committee is to be found in the committee .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motor@@ ists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bo@@ we :
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an has not come to an end this year .
From The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , appeared in January , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a luxury rec@@ re@@ ation scheduled for 4 November , with a number of reports .
Four have already emerged on the To@@ le .
The announcement of a new al@@ m@@ m of David Bow@@ ie had left the whole world .
On the day of its 6@@ 6@@ th birth@@ day , 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ m@@ m would emerge in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last time , Re@@ al@@ ty , the date of 2003 ) and too few public appearances , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an showed that he could still count on him to s@@ cra@@ p the po@@ p .
A f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans
Not as a result of sur@@ prises , David Bow@@ ie had more of a turn in his ba@@ g with The N@@ ex@@ t Day .
The Th@@ in White Du@@ ke therefore planned to re@@ construct this al@@ m@@ m on 4 November .
On the occasion , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a real f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans .
This re@@ edi@@ tion , entitled The N@@ ex@@ at D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a , will be presented in the form of three dis@@ cs : the original al@@ m@@ um , the unprecedented session sessions and the bul@@ ls , and a D@@ V@@ D containing the four cli@@ ps already un@@ covered .
The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a will contain a total of ten additional ti@@ t@@ les in relation to the original al@@ m@@ m : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x@@ e edi@@ tion , five s@@ ong@@ s specifically un@@ ve@@ iled on the occasion , and two cu@@ res .
David Bow@@ ia has made the presen@@ tations of this beautiful co@@ ff@@ t in a video .
It introduces both the record and the acc@@ ess@@ ories provided with : exclusive photo@@ graph@@ s and po@@ les , a car@@ net to share its own im@@ pres@@ sions , a hand@@ -@@ back with words ...
And , above all , it gives a fore@@ taste of its new title At@@ om@@ ica , typically in the ve@@ in of The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , with very strong gu@@ ides and ro@@ bu@@ stly controlled electricity .
Already
But At@@ om@@ ica is not the only title to dis@@ close his weapons .
The In@@ forming , Li@@ ke A Ro@@ k@@ et M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , is also available on the web .
The In@@ formed is in double front : a wor@@ ris@@ ome inter@@ fe@@ ree before a light ca@@ val@@ l@@ at that is gradually slowing down to allow a bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er to take place .
On Li@@ ke A Ro@@ c@@ k@@ et M@@ an , did Bo@@ ys want to make a small reference to the Ro@@ k@@ et M@@ an of El@@ ton John , or even to High Representative ?
With this head@@ line title , the sing@@ er seems in any case to be in his or her position when he no longer has their feet on the ground .
In addition , it was much more serious .
On Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , David Bo@@ y once again refers to his str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold : would he come from another planet ?
There is a desire to leave the Earth .
At any rate , we have been am@@ used to play in cam@@ era with these ti@@ t@@ les : an informal tow@@ er , a man on a roc@@ ket , a Mar@@ ine potential ...
It conce@@ als and reveals the need for different person@@ alities , as he has done throughout his career , particularly with his charac@@ ters Z@@ i@@ gg@@ y St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ addi@@ n S@@ ane .
It is no wonder that he has a m@@ ask in his hands in the photo@@ grap@@ h of the In@@ v@@ estig@@ ation in Bo@@ y@@ age , of the Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , whose new face he embo@@ dies .
It will appear in one of their adverti@@ sements , broadcast from 10 November .
The Defense Minister , Ro@@ b Nichol@@ son , insisted that the w@@ ounded soldiers were not sum@@ mon@@ ed to the Canadian armed forces , and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civil life .
At@@ t@@ ressed by liberals and neo-@@ democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr Nichol@@ son ensured that before their release , members of the army were following a transitional plan with their superi@@ ors .
All w@@ ounded soldiers receive the appropriate care for their return to civilian life , and none of them is released before they are ready .
Cri@@ tics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured military - who do not comply with the rule of &apos; the univers@@ ality of the army &apos; to require staff to carry out a range of different tasks - to reach the 10 years ad@@ mis@@ sibility period required for pension provision .
In particular , they mentioned two cases reported by the Pres@@ se Canad@@ ians , including that of a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Corpor@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a London reser@@ vis@@ t , in On@@ tari@@ o , reached post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to be able to receive fully inde@@ xed retirement .
His case came after that of Corpor@@ al G@@ l@@ en Kir@@ res , who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before he was ready because he did not respond to the rule of univers@@ ality of the service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared , with plans and consultation meetings , but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;@@ I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said in a meeting with Pres@@ se Canadian on Wednesday .
For months I asked whether there was a way to stay , and they said no .
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has been struggling to determine which la@@ titude it can give to w@@ ounded soldiers who want to stay in ranks , but who are not fit for the fight .
Under current rules , the injured soldiers are up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deploy@@ ments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons , 19@@ 9 did not reach the service period required to obtain pension benefits .
The liberal spokes@@ person for former combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , called on Wednesday the reintegration of Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , while the neo-@@ democr@@ at J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for an immediate end to &apos; this shameful practice &apos; .
Dis@@ ney on the T@@ ru@@ th
The American media and enter@@ tainment group has decided to give priority to the t@@ ab@@ lets on its own television channels for the next round of children to come out .
The first nine episo@@ des of S@@ her@@ i@@ ff C@@ alli@@ ers Wil@@ d W@@ est will be available from 24 November on the wat@@ ch@@ dis@@ ne@@ -@@ j@@ uni@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m website or through its application for tele@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
Its global launch on the Dis@@ ney Group chains is planned until 2014 , details the communi@@ qu@@ é of its Dis@@ ney J@@ uni@@ or division .
The lively design , aimed at children aged 2-@@ 7 , tells the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the ch@@ at@@ te C@@ alli@@ e , the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of an American city in the West , where it is putting order in order with a magic l@@ as@@ o .
Every episo@@ de includes two stories of 11 minutes .
&apos;@@ Inter@@ vention with s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commented on Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , Vice-President responsible for digital products at Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , cited in the communi@@ qu@@ é .
This kind of experience between Dis@@ ney efforts to &apos; extend the life span of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important &apos; has added .
A survey published earlier by Comm@@ on Sen@@ se Me@@ di@@ a showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of the less than 2 years have already served a t@@ ab@@ let or a telephone , and 72 % of the less than eight years , respectively 10 % and 38 % two years ago .
S@@ now@@ den
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers of the US intelligence service , said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy to the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director K@@ e@@ ith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities .
The German MEP , Hans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia on Thursday , where he has the right to asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter which the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a le@@ ak and seeks to penalise political dis@@ course with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . &apos;
However , saying the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against it .
As part of the complaint lod@@ ged by the US Department of Justice , he is accused of es@@ pion@@ age and the@@ ft of state property .
Hans@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich , the German Minister for Home Affairs , said in Z@@ e@@ it On@@ line : “ If Mr S@@ now@@ den is prepared to speak to German officials , we will make sure that we make that possible . ”
Relations between the US and Germany have been severely tested following complaints that the N@@ SA had been listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .
Thomas O@@ p@@ tu@@ hot@@ n , the Member who runs the parliamentary group over@@ looking the foreign secret services , has indicated that if there is a chance to hear Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness &apos; without jeopardising and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States &apos; , we should benefit from it .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a Member of the German Ver@@ de , published a photo@@ grap@@ h with him with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
During his visit to Russia he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that , according to the lawyer of the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Mr S@@ now@@ den could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den was in Germany , he would have to be assured that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , said the honourable Member .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter that he was the subject of a &apos; serious and sustained &apos; persecution campaign which forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction to &apos; my act of political expression &apos; .
Citizens throughout the world , as well as senior officials – including the United States – found that the re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was of public uti@@ lity .
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er ’ s subscri@@ bers may have access to applications like Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter , and ultimate video service on Net@@ f@@ li@@ x demand via their television in a future that does not seem so far away .
The Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the be@@ ta version of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;@@ This will enable us to develop more us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces and more options &apos; , explained the President and head of the management of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , Lou@@ is Au@@ d@@ et , in interview .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able thus follows his competitors , such as Belgium , even though Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s subsidiary has not yet had a clear date on this new platform .
&apos;@@ We must adapt and change or resist change and fail &apos; .
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers are currently denied access .
The telec@@ oms giant Ro@@ go@@ ers has already indicated that it could offer networks if certain technical details , which were not mentioned , could be resolved .
In the United States , the popular video service says that it is in discussions with some major c@@ ables so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er also welcomed the announcement by the Har@@ per government in his T@@ ot@@ ine speech on 16 October .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force c@@ able and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay services on the map .
&apos;@@ It is about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains , it does not work &apos; , said Mr Au@@ d@@ et .
It hopes , however , that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Rad@@ io and T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations Council ( CC@@ T@@ C ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;@@ It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television &apos; , said the &apos; de Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o &apos; .
The CC@@ T@@ C has been holding consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring .
As far as the results are concerned , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o has indicated that there has been a net profit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 .
This is a retro@@ grade step compared to the net profit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million , or 83 per cent , of the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this decline by means of depreci@@ ation costs linked to new acquis@@ i@@ tions .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o acquired the Atlantic B@@ ad@@ b@@ and c@@ able in 2012 in the United States for 1.@@ 36 billion .
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal .
Last December , the Est@@ onian company also bought Pe@@ er 1 Network En@@ ter@@ prise , an Internet supplier in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver for the sum of 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s income , they grew 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter to 50@@ 4.@@ 7 million .
They are 1.@@ 8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er , was 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 % , in decline compared with the 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million , or 93 % , of the same period last year .
But Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er ’ s income has increased by 45 % to 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 customers in the fourth quarter .
However , for the 2013 financial year , the number of customers in Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ able is growing 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Au@@ d@@ and is not concerned about the number of customers changing in this way .
For me , this is not an indication of a change of trend , he has observed .
It varies from one quarter to the next with very strong competition .
H@@ horse in beef products
H@@ ep@@ al meat was found in bo@@ vine bo@@ vine bo@@ xes , sold by two small British L@@ ower L@@ ess@@ ons , announced today the food hygiene agency .
routine tests have revealed that products , produced in January in Romania and sold by the Bo@@ g@@ ans and Qu@@ ali@@ ty Sa@@ ve chains , contained the DNA of hor@@ ses of 1 to 5 % .
&apos;@@ Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the British agency .
A scandal about the presence of hor@@ ses in co@@ o@@ ked fl@@ ats broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests in Ireland .
According to European Commission reviews , France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that were supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles left four w@@ ounded , early on Friday , on road 1@@ 31 in Lan@@ audi@@ ère .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ th , a motor@@ ist who was circul@@ ating in the north , in Sain@@ t-@@ F@@ é@@ ic@@ ian de Val@@ o@@ is , lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occup@@ ants of both vehicles were injured , but they were not afraid for their lives .
The movement had returned to normal to 6@@ th , Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to pay up to $ 100 for passengers transporting hand lu@@ gg@@ age on its flights .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to start making up to $ 100 for a hand and $ 2 b@@ agg@@ age for a coffee or a so@@ da , although in its announcement on Wednesday , it indicated that passengers could take the un@@ opened can@@ e with them on the des@@ cent of the plane .
The new b@@ agg@@ age costs are the bag@@ s in the higher compar@@ tment , so the small bag@@ s in the seat will always be free .
Fron@@ tier said that it would pay $ 25 if the costs were paid in advance and $ 100 if the travellers paid only once on the do@@ or@@ step .
The Fron@@ tier spokesman , K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley indicated that the $ 100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance .
‘ We do not want to pay that price ’ , she explained .
The airlines started to make the first and second lu@@ gg@@ age recorded in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who were trying to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in hand@@ -@@ in-@@ hand lu@@ gg@@ age in higher compar@@ tments , so there was often no room for these compar@@ tments .
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers transport fewer things on board .
Mr Mal@@ ley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a question of making it clear to the clients of Fron@@ tier customers that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in higher compar@@ tments .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger qu@@ eu@@ ing up on a bo@@ arding do@@ or@@ step could carry a s@@ ack free , while the next person in the qu@@ e@@ ue could have to pay $ 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
Mr Mal@@ ley has explained that the site and registration procedures of Fron@@ tier are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they reach the door .
Fron@@ tier b@@ agg@@ age charges will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often rou@@ se on b@@ agg@@ age and other charges , but airlines love them .
They believe that the handling costs of lu@@ gg@@ age are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it .
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of b@@ agg@@ age charges as a sign that airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them did not go to b@@ agg@@ age .
S@@ pi@@ rit Air@@ lines In@@ c@@ . had applied the first b@@ agg@@ age charges three years ago , and the low-cost airline Al@@ l@@ on@@ gi@@ ant followed a little later .
The only other company that imposes such costs is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , which has declared the consul@@ tant to airlines J@@ ay S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , who is closely following the costs .
He estimated , in a report in December 2011 , that S@@ pi@@ rit ’ s hand@@ bag@@ s were $ 50 per year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former framework of Mid@@ west Air@@ lines , recently travel@@ ed to S@@ pi@@ rit and asked what it was going to find on the do@@ or@@ step at a time when passengers would discover the un@@ familiar hand charges imposed by the company .
‘ I had never seen an infringement procedure as flu@@ id in my professional career ’ , he said .
I was expecting te@@ eth and a b@@ agg@@ age bur@@ st at the door .
The plane was full , he added , &apos; the passengers are on board at the speed of clarity &apos; .
Fron@@ tier is also like S@@ pi@@ rit and charges $ 2 for a coffee , a th@@ é , a so@@ da or a fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier has indicated that passengers taking a soft or a ju@@ ice can take the can@@ e with them , and those who make coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
US Air@@ ways briefly tried to make drinks pay for drinks in 2008 , but returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large airline had followed .
The decision by Fron@@ tier to make hand@@ -@@ in-@@ hand b@@ agg@@ age charges when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to their site .
Air@@ lines pay for online tri@@ ps like Or@@ bi@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each sold ticket .
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier has gone further in this area .
In September , she began to offer only half of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it has reduced the premiums by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a Fron@@ tier trip de@@ 1 000 miles bought with an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Fron@@ tier site .
Fron@@ tier has a true cli@@ ent in his home town , Den@@ ver , but his activity is declining and it loses money .
The revenue fell by 9 % and its flight capacity fell by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company , Public Air@@ ways Hol@@ dings In@@ c .
The public has tried to redress Fron@@ tier finances by selling the airline .
N@@ SA
The National Security Agency working in the shad@@ ows said on Friday that it was a bu@@ g that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , not ha@@ c@@ kers , as some had claimed online .
&quot; N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v remained un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for a few hours this evening because of an internal error which took place during a planned update &apos; , indicated the es@@ pion@@ age agency in a declaration by em@@ ail .
The problem will be resolved this evening .
The allegations that the breakdown was due to a service denial denial of service ( D@@ S@@ D ) are false .
Ear@@ lier this evening , online ser@@ vers of ser@@ vers noted that the N@@ SA site was at least 6 p.m. , and some users still cannot access the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokes@@ person told A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the agency &apos;s sensitive internal network was not a compromise .
No classified information is in danger , explained the spokes@@ person .
At least a group of online ha@@ k@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts has claimed to be responsible for the N@@ SA ’ s breakdown with a D@@ S@@ D attack .
The D@@ S@@ D attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
Cy@@ ber tactics are not very sophisticated , and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system .
The formerly secret N@@ SA , a time called “ N@@ o Su@@ ch A@@ gen@@ y , ” has been in the spot@@ light and strongly criticised in recent months as a result of a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its vast communications surveillance programs at national and abroad – which are among the N@@ SA ’ s secret files and dis@@ closed by the former dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
This growing controversy over the agency caused much speculation that this evening &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber@@ -@@ operation .
The Del@@ ta C@@ enter now closed
The D@@ ta C@@ en@@ t-@@ V@@ ille ho@@ tel closed on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that owned the edi@@ fic@@ e sold it to promo@@ ters who will turn it into student homes .
Three hundred and fifty people were working in the ho@@ tel .
Of these , 200 have still not found new jobs .
Del@@ ta promises not to let his employees fall .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers have come to meet employees directly on the spot , and the employees have met their needs individually .
&apos;@@ This is going to continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the working relations of H@@ op@@ t@@ el@@ ta Del@@ ta , F@@ eli@@ x Ben@@ is@@ son .
The closure of the Del@@ ta comes in a highly competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that was the owner of that construction had choices to make .
Either he re@@ invested in building it to continue to operate , so there were investments of tens of millions while competition is very fierce , there are many new hot@@ els that appeared in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&apos;@@ Or either he sell it to someone else , and that is what has happened &apos; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ult , who is the holder of the Tourism Tra@@ d@@ ar C@@ ar to the A@@ W@@ A@@ M &apos;s W@@ ast@@ e Scho@@ ol .
Other Mon@@ tre@@ al hot@@ els will also be converted in the coming months , such as the C@@ rown P@@ la@@ za , which will become a residence for the elderly .
In the meantime , four ho@@ tel projects tot@@ alling nearly 600 cham@@ bers will come into being within two years .
For the CE@@ O of Ti@@ tan , &apos; Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar A@@ mi@@ ens &apos; purchase project begins with zero employed &apos; .
Having cast a f@@ ence in January for the partial recovery of the Go@@ od@@ ad@@ ar website promised to closure , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , the CE@@ O of the American T@@ yp@@ ical P@@ ty@@ ma@@ ker , is now declaring himself ready to save 3@@ 33 jobs on the 1 137 of the plant .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ burg , the Minister for productive recovery , had already announced it on Monday 21 October .
Having given up on the draft purchase of the plant in January , you are now returning .
You spoke of violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about &apos; so-called workers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; mad &apos; unions , targeting the G@@ T@@ T .
We do not understand this U@@ -@@ turn .
Is it to please Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Sa@@ ve my wife .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
If I have w@@ ounded someone with my words , I am sorry .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Is the truth ?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries is working eight hours handic@@ aps France .
In India , in China and in other countries , we are working ten to twelve hours a day .
But I do not have any prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is well located , and has sp@@ aces for enlargement .
Why does Ti@@ tan need this plant so much ?
There is no need to buy this plant .
But , with the right price and the competent workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Go@@ od@@ year had offered employees a good start , I think 100 % of employees would have accepted it .
Now let us imagine that T@@ an@@ tan is buying the closed factory in Go@@ od@@ dy@@ ar .
Therefore , T@@ an@@ tan could move machines to Poland or to any other EU country that still has its own currency .
I think Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg knows this .
He wants to keep the factory in A@@ mi@@ ens with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid jobs .
T@@ an@@ tan agrees to recru@@ it them among the 1 200 current employees of Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar .
That is why Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a commitment from T@@ an@@ tan before trying to get the C@@ G@@ T to sit down with Go@@ od@@ dy@@ ar .
The first step is that the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar should have an agreement on the starting allowance for all employees .
Therefore , there will be no more employees at the factory .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm that ?
The only number I have mentioned to the Minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four@@ -year guarantee .
But , as I told you , the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar must first agree on the starting point .
If all employees accept them , the purchase project of the factory starts with zero .
How can we provide guarantees of employment when there are no more employees at the site ?
If Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg succe@@ eds in getting the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ dy@@ e@@ ar to agree , and that Ti@@ tan is buying the factory , then we intend to remain in North North for more than four years .
The profit of B@@ om@@ mer@@ di@@ er , while the deli@@ veries and orders of aircraft
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er In@@ c , Canadian aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical and rail manufacturer , sign@@ alled a 15 % drop in its net profits on Thursday , under pressure from a drop in orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its island division .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , also did not provide flight testing data for his or her new C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft or information to know whether the plane will comply with its ambitious timetable for commercial service before September .
After the inaug@@ ur@@ ation of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago , it has been stolen only three times , and the question then arose as to whether the trial phase was on the right track .
The results did not match the forecasts and the stock prices fell by 8 % on the Tor@@ onto Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change .
Cam@@ ero@@ on Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st in the National Bank Financial Bank , low@@ ered the rating on Thursday , going from “ over@@ performance ” to “ sector performance , ” owing to the low potential for the stock market in the next quarter or two quarters .
‘ Although the decline in the supply of aircraft has been largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the transport division ’ , declared Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen on a note to customers .
We believe that B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er will register new orders for his C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft as the flight testing programme moves forward .
However , if no new order is announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
B@@ om@@ ard hopes that the family of C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft can cat@@ ap@@ ult in the lower seg@@ ment of a market today dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first trial plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and went for the first time in September after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft has been modest up to 17@@ 7 , and it seems that potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to valid@@ ate society &apos;s claims about energy efficiency and the potential for economies of the new air@@ plane .
At present , the company has recorded a total of 40@@ 3 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ to , President and head of the leadership , is convinced that B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft commercial service .
The leaders also reassured the analy@@ sts and the media on Thursday that the programme was proceeding according to the timetable .
&apos;@@ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected &apos; , said Mr Be@@ au@@ owe at a telephone conference , adding that the ground tests and the software up@@ dates were provided for during the flight time .
Each manufacturer is planning differently .
We decided to carry out a first flight and to provide for an update period , and that is what we have done .
This will happen throughout the flying programme .
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks , the rest will follow shortly afterwards , has indicated society .
Yet analy@@ sts are skep@@ tical that the first customer can fly a C@@ Ser@@ ies plane only 12 months after his inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er has indicated that she is assessing the timetable for entry and will provide new information in the coming months .
“ The slow pace of flight trials – though apparently in keeping with the internal timetable of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015 , said Mr Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
In the third quarter , on 30 September , B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net benefit fell to 14@@ 7 M , or 8 c@@ ents per action , compared to $ 17@@ 2 , or 9 c@@ ents per year , a year earlier .
The result of adjusted action has remained unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
The income has declined slightly from 4.@@ 2 to $ 4.@@ 1 trillion .
An@@ aly@@ sts expected a 10 c@@ ents of action , and $ 4.@@ 56 trillion , according to Thomas Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / E / S@@ .
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that it delivered 45 planes in the quarter , compared to 57 a year earlier .
N@@ et orders fell to 26 aircraft , compared to 83 before .
The delay in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical division was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 M@@ in to 30 September , which was unchanged compared to 31 December of the previous year .
&apos;@@ In A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing &apos; , said Mr Be@@ au@@ owe .
A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical incomes have fallen by 13 % to $ 2 trillion .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , said that the income from this division had risen by nearly 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 trillion .
The orders for the Trans@@ -@@ sports division total $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 trillion to 30 September , a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year .
The margins for the transport division have suffered from implementing problems for a few large contracts .
The leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter .
The course of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s actions , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ch@@ et@@ te , the head of the Google In@@ c Financial Direc@@ torate , would sit on the Management Board , fell from 8@@ .5 % to USD 4.@@ 83 in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazilian company Em@@ bra@@ er SA , the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and the closest competi@@ tor to B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , indicated on Thursday a 10 % drop in its quar@@ terly benefit .
Two sp@@ ra@@ e@@ olog@@ ists of 23 and 27 years were missing in a cha@@ s@@ m under the D@@ have of Cro@@ es since Thursday evening , was taught on Friday at the rescue of the Is@@ le of the Is@@ le .
They have been located on this Friday afternoon .
The two men , a tw@@ ist , in practice and the other no , went on the ground on Thursday to 9.@@ 30 p.m. in order to make a crossing of the D@@ ess of Cro@@ ats , located on the common Sain@@ t Pi@@ er@@ re-@@ de-@@ Char@@ tre@@ e .
Since then , we have had nothing new since then .

There were some 20 sec@@ res@@ ists , ten members of the French S@@ p@@ el@@ e@@ o rescue , as well as police , C@@ R@@ S and fire@@ fighters .
At the end of the afternoon this Friday , the two s@@ amples were loc@@ alised .
&apos;@@ It is another group of s@@ wel@@ e@@ olog@@ ists who , after having been exhausted but in good health in the ca@@ val@@ se , passed information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network &apos; explains the D@@ au@@ ph@@ in .

German journalists to flee Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o
The German journalists ’ union invited its members to stop using Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o in the wake of new re@@ vel@@ ations about US and British intelligence activities .
&apos;@@ The German Federation of Jour@@ n@@ alists recommends that journalists avoid the use of search engines and of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o &apos; , in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
It considers the Washington Po@@ st ’ s information to be “ outrageous , ” according to which the US National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) and the United Kingdom ’ s G@@ C@@ H@@ Q ( G@@ C@@ H@@ Q ) have collected mass information by inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating international networks that allow both firms to syn@@ chron@@ ise their ser@@ vers .
&apos;@@ Research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &apos; , added Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ ken , the President of the trade union , claiming 3@@ 8@@ ,000 members .

The plan by the Minister , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els , of &apos; re@@ connec@@ ting &apos; fi@@ xes of traffic lights in Brussels does not like everyone .
As a reminder , the Brussels Minister of Labour and Transport , on Thursday at the centre of Brussels , launched a test project to pain@@ t 16 po@@ te@@ ms of traffic lights from the region to the y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ours in Brussels .
The aim is both &apos; to increase security &apos; and &apos; the Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long term , to re@@ pain@@ t all the Brussels traffic lights at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
However , the blue chosen by the Minister is &apos; too we@@ t &apos; , according to the Brussels MEP Em@@ manu@@ el De Bo@@ ck , who speaks of the &apos; fl@@ ames &apos; of the capital and calls for the &apos; resignation &apos; of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els .
&apos;@@ Not content to spend the money on the Brussels of the Brussels and the Brussels Region &apos; s money on the f@@ rin@@ ge operations of the Brussels Region , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els , is continuing its operations on the capital of capital .
After his tax@@ -@@ man@@ e-@@ man@@ e-@@ man@@ ual tax@@ is , she finally pain@@ ted the po@@ te@@ ms of Brussels in the dark .
According to the honourable Member , there is no longer &apos; more difference of visual continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels &apos; .
Brussels deserves better than to see their money being wasted by a Minister C@@ D V@@ V , who itself carries out the N@@ V@@ A programme .
It is high time to stop the Tro@@ j@@ an horse from F@@ landers .
&apos;@@ To recall , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els was elected only with 2 2@@ 45 votes to 0.5 % of Brussels ! &apos; , concludes Mr De Bo@@ ck .

Five years ago , my father lost the world of living .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking to him now ,
I was so afraid to forget this , or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to &apos; attend &apos; .
There is no recipe , no way of working to move the wall of the in@@ visible and regain its own .
Then there are signs .
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving .
Once again , a double aw@@ ak@@ ening in the middle of the night to look at his shows that no longer leaves me on the night table .
It is the image of my s@@ mil@@ ing father who ac@@ companies me in my daily gest@@ ures .
Our mother left us after her exhausted fight against cancer .
That is at least what I thought of the day when I found his empty body , cr@@ acked down on this hospital bed to che@@ ated flags .
Likewise , his fun@@ eral was a gl@@ aci@@ al f@@ are@@ well focused around the sc@@ ant light of the cha@@ s@@ m that controlled her co@@ ff@@ in .
I thought it was a part .
L@@ it@@ tle by little , by small , bal@@ ance-@@ of-@@ bal@@ nal appearances , a little ti@@ mid , a little wi@@ el@@ ded , it quickly returned to my mind , moving as it took its place in the landscape of my thought that believed in m@@ our@@ ning .
And then it turned out to be at the heart of my own fac@@ ets that I had not yet seen , m@@ asked by my relationship with her .
I therefore learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother , but simply a woman whom I was not really aware of , a woman who embo@@ died this person , during her stay in life .
In dying , this woman had a perfect life and liber@@ ated the person I love , and here I found her , full and full .
This is the most unexpected and beautiful way forward .
It is a privilege to know that the loved people are never leaving us .
I resemb@@ le my father , &apos; in de@@ ed as well as he did &apos; .
I have always been told .
I never believed it at that time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , sick .
Here I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him .
One day he died .
For a long time , he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I was wrong ...
He spoke to me , he was constantly encouraging me , he was my body .
I saw his hands when looking at mine , I l@@ ent my body .
But it was never in@@ discre@@ et .
I have had a personal life .
It left me in@@ tim@@ ate .
It lasted for a long time and one day .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I no longer know who said that the people who died are not forgotten but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer , but I am constantly in favour of them .
Every event , every moment of my life makes me feel that I am here because I always refer to it : what would have been said ?
I always dream of them , perhaps not every ni@@ ghts but several times a week .
I often dream of the last few moments I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this moment .
I often wake up to an@@ gu@@ ish when that happens , and I feel that they are not here .
Sometimes , some dreams are directed at me and are part of my history , and indeed they continue to live and share my life .
The day before I had to know the sex of my baby , I dre@@ am@@ t that I wo@@ ke up , I was lying out , my father was waiting for me and he s@@ mil@@ ed me and was delighted that I was waiting for a small bo@@ y .
The next day , I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sle@@ ep to tell me that he was happy to share what I had .
And of course it was a small bo@@ y in my ven@@ ue .
I wanted to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell the common memory after his death .
Five years ago , my grand@@ mother died as a result of cancer .
A year ago , she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
It is the shock that his disappearance caused the young b@@ ast@@ er that I was at the time .
However , I have done my m@@ our@@ ning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , especially in times when I find myself in difficulty , or when I have to take important decisions .
To look to the Arab@@ ic and to interest me in the Middle East , to the point of making a mo@@ ck@@ ery of it in a great school , has not been , with the hin@@ d@@ sight , of an@@ od@@ ine choices .
In fact , I was often hearing it Arab in my childhood , and talking about Morocco , where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values that she has accused me are still present , so I think I can think of how she would like me to act at some point .
The same applies to my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and the righ@@ te@@ ousness of the spirit that was a beli@@ ever@@ s beli@@ ever@@ s .
From now on , I feel like a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent soul , a sal@@ v@@ ory spirit .
I see his eyes .
My mother died 19 years ago .
Mor@@ te after I spoke to the telephone .
I have gone through all the phases : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , pain , the be@@ aches that are going on on their own , anywhere , whenever , in un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited places , in@@ con@@ gr@@ uous times .
Then time has cal@@ med the sentence .
It has remained only the lack , this empty vacuum , and the need for it , to entr@@ ust me , to reassure me that it is soft .
However , it is there , a silent presence , it is there and I am looking at it .
All the morning , I see his concern about me , I see the r@@ ings that are increasing their eyes , the ri@@ p@@ ples around the li@@ ps that cigarettes are growing , the pl@@ ates that mark the front days of concern .
My mother has taken on my face and she is looking at me every morning in my mir@@ ror .
All the morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and mother of my three children died from cancer to 43 years .
Its protection is constantly being felt , nothing serious can happen .
It was his promise on his be@@ ac@@ on of pain , so little has been learned to s@@ mile , and pronoun@@ cing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I speak to him in the cru@@ x of the night when the absence is too bad , she inv@@ ites in my dreams when the mor@@ ale is a little achieved .
We feel that we are being caught and protected in difficult times , the time has come for us to realise how the or@@ che@@ str@@ a , and we are trying to stay on the path we have outlined .
If you were very keen to be a member of the House , the absence of it could not take you from heart and memories .
In some ways , loved ones become your internal energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked .
I was not able to witness his hum@@ ination and three weeks after his death , I gave birth to a small bo@@ y .
If I have my convictions at times , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision .
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me , it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , I do not know , and I always wonder what it will be about .
I do not know whether I have adopted its way of being or whether I am just like him : is this genetic ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a change of e@@ go , there was no need to speak between us .
In short , he is here on a daily basis .
I feel that he is here and that makes me happy .
It is almost 30 years since my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I had 28 years and our son six years .
The immense sentence that then inv@@ aded me has , of course , less@@ ened , but it is always close to me .
Very often he &apos; land &apos; in my dreams in such a precise way , so vi@@ vi@@ d that I am even more sad to see that this was only a dream .
On the other night , he asked me whether I was going well , I told him no , he said &apos; I am des@@ cent &apos; but with such a real voice that I wo@@ ke up to my b@@ reath , an@@ gu@@ ish and k@@ ic@@ king the lam@@ b of hor@@ ses and watching all the people who believe it will happen .
I still live in the same house , and often I feel that I am watching and I look back to see if he is not here , I know he is him and I am speaking to him .
In all the coins I feel that I am here and that makes me happy .
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and the spirit lives with me .
I have 58 years , I have always lived alone since its departure , and it is and will remain the love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am a soci@@ ally-@@ responsible job , and I am , I am glad , I am grand@@ mother , I have full friends , but my heart and soul belong to her and I am never talking about her except my son , and I am never going to the c@@ eme@@ tery .
Iraq : October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month since 2008
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008 .
This Friday , Baghdad published official figures : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month : 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers .
This publication takes place on the day that the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants help from the US .
&apos;@@ We are not saying to the world that we stand by our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , said al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki this Thursday in Washington .
And , because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved , this will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also expand .
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives ?
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
O@@ ut@@ side the building , demonstrators prote@@ sted against the Iraqi leader .
They used plac@@ ards acc@@ using him of being a murde@@ rer and calling on the US to refuse to provide aid .
The co@@ c@@ ain@@ ic lawyer who informed a drug spons@@ or of a police investigation was imprisoned in prison .
Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to the criminal l@@ ord N@@ ei@@ l S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh
The lawyer was afraid that his co@@ ver@@ t drug addiction was revealed to the great day .
He was sentenced to a prison sentence of three years by the Li@@ ver@@ pool Li@@ ving Court in Li@@ ver@@ pool .
A great defence lawyer who had informed a drug spons@@ or of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his co@@ ver@@ t drug addiction was not revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , gave sensitive information to the war@@ l@@ ord N@@ ei@@ l S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh concerning investigations into his dru@@ g@@ -related activities after having compromised because of his habit of eating co@@ c@@ ain@@ e .
The lawyer , who was known as &apos; Bas@@ h &apos; and considered by criminals as a &apos; prime issue &apos; , was arrested at home in 2011 following police listening operations directed at S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , which he represented at a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials have re@@ pai@@ red Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 years ago , by tabling three bag@@ s of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e at the home of the lawyer in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , while he was at a din@@ ner of Bar@@ re@@ au with colleagues .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ations revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of this class ’ A drugs after tests showed trac@@ es of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in its ha@@ ir , portfolio , and credit cards .
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought illegal information about the arrest of two men on the S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough account and one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e trafficking in the coun@@ ties of Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
With 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for a sum of £ 1.5 million , as well as over £ 200 000 in cash in a series of ra@@ ids .
T@@ it@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be exposed to the day .
Today , at the Li@@ ver@@ pool in Li@@ ver@@ pool , T@@ it@@ ta , who works in the cabinet of For@@ bes Solidarity , located in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , fell out of office after having been found guilty of two charges of impe@@ di@@ ment to justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He admitted the possession of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he was regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators followed the suspect and returned to the home of Di@@ t@@ ta and put drugs , pure to 60 % , under the b@@ ann@@ er of the lawyer in a black gol@@ f g@@ ang .
S@@ hor@@ tly after the submission , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta , who was at a din@@ ner at the Fo@@ ot@@ ball Par@@ k football stad@@ ium , a forum of the Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n Ro@@ tw@@ er@@ p club .
The lawyer has returned to his home , has discovered drugs and has been tele@@ ph@@ oned on nine occasions .
The court has heard that Di@@ t@@ ta is a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests have shown trac@@ es of such a class drugs in its ha@@ ir , portfolio , and credit cards .
T@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but denied co@@ c@@ ain@@ e ; he said that he had spoken about the alleged drug trafficking because he was his cli@@ ent and argued that their discussions were subject to a &apos; legal privilege &apos; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards , but they were all seized and a s@@ ample of ha@@ ir was taken .
He said during an inter@@ rog@@ ation that he had an office at home , as well as in his place of work , and that there were customers who call him home for legal matters .
But the court has heard evidence that he has been calling major players in the drug trade , some of whom he had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investig@@ ators were aware .
The prosecutor An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : &apos; If anyone is aware that the law must not be violated , it is a criminal lawyer . &apos;
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal lawyer , and of having too much involvement with individual customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug trafficking , but a drug trafficking that provides drugs to its own lawyer .
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer .
But that went far beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
He has obstruc@@ ted the police investigation as much as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not honour his profession , but did not honour him .
It has been too close to some customers , especially S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and has allowed its independence to be compromised .
T@@ it@@ ta has denied any illegal action and said : &apos; If I was a corrupt lawyer , what I am not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not have waited 15 hours , I would have done so immediately . &apos;
But after the hearing , the over@@ ar@@ ching Le@@ e Hal@@ ste@@ ad of the La@@ hi@@ sh@@ ire Policy said : &apos; Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has gone from a criminal lawyer to criminal himself as he began to buy drugs from criminal organisations . &apos;
His addiction to co@@ c@@ ain@@ e has compromised him forever and made it vulnerable to the motives of leaders of organised criminal groups who have charged him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations .
L@@ aw@@ yers should observe the most stringent rules of integrity and create a climate of trust among the public .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has betra@@ yed that confidence and tried to hide behind the virtu@@ es of his profession .
The serious and organised crime unit in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re conducted the investigation into Mr Di@@ t@@ ta , who was found guilty of the three heads of charge of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e possession and now obstruc@@ ts justice , demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminal criminals .
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after ple@@ ading guilty of complicity in hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years of drug trafficking .
On his website , Di@@ t@@ ta organised a sitting of questions / answers on himself during which he said that his dream would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his last gu@@ est at din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali and inequality would motiv@@ ate him to work .

L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es
A sho@@ oting took place at L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es international airport .
It was 10.@@ 00 in the morning when a man opened fire .
According to the local police , there are at least 2 injured .
It would be an employee working for the US Transport Security Administration ( T@@ SA ) and the author of the fire .
The incident occurred in ter@@ minal 3 , causing a wave of panic .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers and staff have been w@@ rap@@ ped up to out@@ bur@@ sts , or on tar@@ m@@ c .
Very quickly police forces have intervened , and a man suspected of being the draw@@ er was arrested on the ro@@ of of an airport par@@ king .
The airport is being evac@@ uated and air traffic is being interrupted .
The Tra@@ di@@ tional L@@ ong
Each time it is the school cli@@ en@@ te@@ le that will be targeted , an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season .
By means of five s@@ ay@@ n@@ ates imagined and interpreted by artists in the region , the stic@@ ks with a high do@@ se of hum@@ our , young people are allowed to learn the classi@@ cal s@@ cri@@ pt .
In addition to this spectac@@ le , the Kingdom &apos;s ly@@ ric@@ al art Society will return with its ly@@ ric@@ al D@@ est@@ its , a formula that is now filled with the P@@ ul@@ per@@ ia of Ch@@ em@@ ti@@ m@@ i .
Two other concer@@ ts will take place in the summer of 2014 , giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of .
In addition to this , there was the ly@@ ric@@ al Ap@@ pendi@@ x , which was held last August , with the help of the so@@ cc@@ ano col@@ or@@ i@@ ature Mari@@ e-@@ E@@ ve M@@ und@@ ers .
It was acti@@ vit@@ y-@@ benefit , along with the artistic dimension , and it helped the non-@@ profit body to produce a financial balance sheet that is as swe@@ et as an air in the m@@ ouse .
Without giving any precise figures , the President of the Management Board , Y@@ ves Ber@@ ger@@ on , took advantage of yesterday &apos;s press meeting in Ch@@ um@@ ti@@ m@@ i to be reassuring .
Despite the prec@@ ari@@ ousness of so many cultural institutions , the future is emerging , even in the long term .
We have more solid and constant support .
&apos;@@ Finance is af@@ lo@@ at and we hope to last up to the 50@@ th anniversary of the oper@@ a , a step that we will take in seven years &apos; , has commented on the adminis@@ tr@@ ator .

calls for collective redress against the S@@ wi@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ ice bro@@ thers
A new request for collective redress has been lod@@ ged against the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ Cross bro@@ thers , on sexual assa@@ ults that would have taken place this time at the Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ bit and in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the shar@@ k &apos;s testi@@ mony , identified as &apos; J@@ .@@ J@@ . &apos; , which would have been mas@@ qu@@ ished in the 195@@ 0s , first in No@@ s@@ . D@@ am@@ e-@@ De@@ -@@ N@@ ei@@ ges by his prof@@ essor , the bro@@ ther , the Fa@@ ther , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , at the Sain@@ t Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ bit , where he was used as a m@@ ouse and where his father worked as pain@@ tings .
The first resort was only three institutions , and when the regulation was announced , many people said to us : &apos; I was in that place , I can register myself &apos; , tell the lawyer Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ult , who defends the victims in both cases .
The collective redress that has just been tabled is a special feature of allowing complain@@ ants to be added to any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Sain@@ t Cross congestion .
At the moment , the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim that they have been attacked by the Sain@@ t Cross bro@@ thers .
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also stresses that the rule of Sain@@ t Cross and the St Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ bit , which is a separate entity , &apos; have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &apos; , that they &apos; have exercised a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &apos; , that they &apos; knew about the sexual abuse of the victims and have nevertheless stif@@ led them &apos; , and that they have &apos; consci@@ ously and consci@@ ously chosen to ignore the problem &apos; .
The latest accusations are based on letters drawn up by the lawyer of the Sain@@ t-@@ Cross bro@@ thers , M@@ e E@@ mi@@ l Per@@ r@@ in , in the 1990s , but also by the research into the archi@@ ves on this subject by bro@@ ther Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy , a former bro@@ ther of Sain@@ t Cross who publicly denounced the abuses .
The collective redress must first pass the stage of ad@@ mis@@ sibility in court .
Once the Court ad@@ mits ad@@ mis@@ sibility , we proceed to the second stage or the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first resort , the church of the Ho@@ ly C@@ r@@ nu@@ t had agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ ably before hearings were conducted on the substance .
Im@@ posing fire in trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the L@@ Sal@@ le region in Mon@@ tre@@ al in the night of Thursday to Friday .
Re@@ li@@ ef was called at 1.@@ 00 , on Friday , because of a fire that had declared the sub@@ soil of an Indian co@@ o@@ king restaur@@ ant on D@@ ol@@ ard , near the inter@@ section with the R@@ an@@ ana street .
The 30 fire bri@@ g@@ ade who were sent to the scene took almost an hour to get the bra@@ kes under control .
The fire was &apos; caused major damage to the building structure &apos; , indicated the head of the operations of the Mon@@ tre@@ al fire security service , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in the restaur@@ ant when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived .
There have been no injuries , but almost twenty homes , located in the first and second place of this commercial side , have had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross has been requested because the residents of one of the flat@@ s may have to be temporarily temporarily temporarily mentioned .
Many opposition to medical aid to die in Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care
The Canadian pal@@ lia@@ tives Congress , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical aid to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
This is an opportunity for several pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to calm their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few of them would like to end their days , according to a spokes@@ person for the Canadian P@@ pal@@ lia@@ tives Association , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ et@@ te .
If we were to focus on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia approach would become minimal .
The Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c S@@ pal@@ lia@@ tive S@@ care Network also rejects the draft law on medical aid to die .
If it is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ é@@ ry is concerned about the consequences for future generations .
&apos;@@ What is the meaning of life &apos; ?
The majority of the pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses will refuse to help patients to die , according to the Vice-@@ Chair of the S@@ pal@@ lia@@ tive C@@ l@@ ass House , Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e F@@ it@@ z@@ back .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ back , who is also the head of the Ma@@ thi@@ e@@ -@@ S@@ av@@ an house in G@@ ati@@ ne@@ au , believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway .
We never ask : &apos; I want to die , give me an injec@@ tion &apos; .
The Director of the S@@ T@@ U@@ C , Ri@@ k Fir@@ th , believes that the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c bill dis@@ orien@@ t@@ ates the population with regard to the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He does not believe that the On@@ tari@@ o will follow suit .
For its part , the Liberal MEP , St@@ é@@ ph@@ ania V@@ all@@ és , says that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press
&apos;@@ It is a frigh@@ tening country and it is legitimate to ask the question : what will prevent Parliament from wi@@ ping out the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? &apos; , said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and calling for it to be declared un@@ constitutional .
“ This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and very p@@ uni@@ tive , and we reject it , ” explained C@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ au , the Director-General of Capital Group – the owner of Cap@@ it@@ tal@@ F@@ M , one of the most respected independent radio stations and Internet sites in Kenya .
He said that the new media court will always be one-sided because it is an extension of the government , and the restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
‘ I hope that the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the Members of Parliament ’ .
According to the newspaper The Sta@@ r , the new bill will allow the government to have &quot; media media &quot; . The Stand@@ ard , for its part , said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &quot; had suffered a hard blow &quot; and used the bill as &quot; d@@ rac@@ onian . &quot;
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the West@@ g@@ ate trade centre last September .
The Ken@@ yan media ar@@ oused anger by the authorities by dissem@@ inating images of video cam@@ er@@ as on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were supposedly the luxury commercial centre .
The head of the police , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ y@@ o , responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them , even though the conven@@ ing was withdrawn as a result of an end to the media .
Under the new draft law , the media can be pun@@ ishable by fines of up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &apos; radi@@ ated &apos; or no official press acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the goods of a offen@@ der if it has not paid its fine .
According to the D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , “ even one fine is enough to paraly@@ se most F@@ M stations . ”
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya ’ s “ anim@@ ated blo@@ go@@ sphere . ”
By reducing the media silence , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
“ No one will ever know , ” wrote Mu@@ tu@@ ma Ma@@ thi@@ u , a journalist at The N@@ ation , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of control in public life .
“ Li@@ ving to themselves , politicians would put the country bankrupt , and we would get back to hun@@ t and co@@ ol . ”
Ken@@ yan legislators have been the target of popular anger in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the cuts made by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mi@@ gh@@ ty wages of around 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month tax@@ -free , which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmac@@ ists
L@@ av@@ al ’ s departure from almost 10 pharmac@@ ists at the Social Health and Services Centre ( S@@ S@@ S ) in L@@ av@@ al caused a whole e@@ el at the head of the Ci@@ te@@ -@@ de Health Ho@@ sp@@ ital , in 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
As a result of multiple retirement , maternity leave or departure leave , the pharm@@ acy department has found itself to be highly defici@@ ent in staff .
There was almost 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , along the head of the department , G@@ illi@@ an Be@@ au@@ d@@ et .
However , the S@@ CA@@ S@@ S decided not to employ independent labour , which can cost up to three times as much as a full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist .
There was no use of the breakdown , explained Mrs Be@@ au@@ d@@ et .
We have stream@@ lined or reduced some of our activities within the framework of the pat@@ ch@@ work , the time that matters .
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young people &#91; residents in pharm@@ acies &#93; to come and stay here .
There is a competition of circumstances which has led to a bad situation last year .
improvement
After this ar@@ du@@ ous period , the year 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 will be much easier for the S@@ S@@ S pharm@@ acy department .
Already three pharmac@@ ists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmac@@ ists have been hi@@ red in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit , because the four pupils who are now in residence in L@@ av@@ al have also decided to remain at the employment of the S@@ S@@ S .
Now , it is much better , has highlighted the pharmac@@ ist .
By the end of the financial year we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity returns .
So this will be closed last year .
L@@ ess
However , the situation remains delicate .
Several factors , such as the shortage of hospital pharmac@@ ists or the predomin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because there is a young middle , and many young women are employed , so with pregnan@@ cies , we almost always have three maternity leave when it goes well , she added .
In the last year , much more has been done and there is no pharmac@@ ists who are available to replace them , so it was more difficult .
The 22 years does not start his career in the cinema by the back door .
The ma@@ ker L@@ ars von T@@ ri@@ er chose him to emb@@ ody Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg young in N@@ y@@ pe@@ hom@@ i@@ a@@ c , his next film .
This porno@@ graphic drama is gr@@ ounded , in eight chapters that will emerge in two parts ( 1 and 8 January 2014 ) , the ero@@ tic memories of a qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ gen@@ ic qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ gen@@ aire to sex since its ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence .
The resemb@@ l@@ ance of Sta@@ c@@ y Martin with his el@@ dest is striking : a sil@@ ver silence , a di@@ ap@@ it@@ ology and French origins .
Not to mention a certain sense of risk : the one that had not hesit@@ ated to put on ice paper is going to be seen in much more sulphur situations on a large scre@@ en .
An extr@@ act from N@@ y@@ pe@@ hom@@ an@@ a@@ c has raised the temperature on the To@@ le : Sta@@ y Martin is on the bed and in full ex@@ ac@@ tment with Shi@@ a La@@ Be@@ ou@@ f .
If the provoc@@ ative film has asked its players to put their own house in order , it has resor@@ ted to X professionals for the most o@@ dious sex scenes , before mer@@ ging all the bodies num@@ er@@ ically : above the bel@@ t , it is the star ; it is the star .
From B@@ j@@ ör@@ k to Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg , via Nic@@ o@@ le K@@ id@@ man , L@@ ars von T@@ ri@@ er is accustomed to pushing his ac@@ complic@@ es in their latest back@@ l@@ ashes , always for the better .
Sta@@ y Martin has not finished talking about it .
A N@@ ar@@ go@@ -@@ evac@@ uated N@@ R@@ R room on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening , the first session of a film was suspended in N@@ ar@@ good N@@ G@@ R , as a precautionary measure , as a result of pi@@ g@@ lets at the thro@@ at of the spec@@ t@@ ators .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , the director of the establishment went to evac@@ u@@ ate the room and warned the fire@@ men for a suspect sm@@ ell .
There are about 70 people out of the sitting .
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not been given .
Is there a jo@@ ke in the te@@ ar case ?
Or an un@@ intended incident ?
Still , the cinema leadership has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers at the bottom .
The room has been postponed and everything has gone into order .
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and customers can regain the pleasure of the images .
On the scre@@ en alone .
It is trying to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls
Taking advantage of the H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en day , a woman tried to bring two kil@@ os of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into the country hidden in tanks , on Thursday morning at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ tain airport .
It was when we looked at the b@@ agg@@ age of the smugg@@ lers that drugs could be detected .
co@@ c@@ ain@@ e had been distributed in three c@@ ad@@ ill@@ as which were previously de@@ ported .
Drugs were then transported to the Office of the Ro@@ yal G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie of Canada ( G@@ R@@ C ) which took over in this investigation .
The Canada border services agency ( SA@@ F@@ C ) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
It was part of the investigation , indicated J@@ acqu@@ e@@ ine Rob@@ ary , the SA@@ F@@ C spokesman .
What I can tell you is that it came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border agents at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ tain airport have carried out 17@@ 3 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 se@@ iz@@ ures of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , the border service agents in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region made a total of 16@@ 53 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs .
Air aviation
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A ship@@ ment of S@@ -@@ air missiles SA@@ -@@ 8 would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new aviation ra@@ id in Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz ) has not been confirmed either by Israel or Syria .
The ra@@ id took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an an@@ onymous American official who confirmed to C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack , aimed at this time , for solar missiles Y@@ ak@@ h@@ have , delivered by Russia in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Israeli officials did not hide their irrit@@ ation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine
The credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora low@@ ered the credit rating of Ukraine on Friday , challenging the capacity of the former Soviet Republic , in recession for more than a year , to meet its financial obligations .
The note of the country ’ s government debt is going to &apos; B@@ - &apos; , falling into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative perspective , and S &amp; P sees at least one chance in three that it will be reduced by a year .
“ It is becoming less and less likely that the government ’ s strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs , explain the US agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine ’ s foreign-@@ exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 , and that the trend will continue .
This complic@@ ates the re@@ payment of appropriations abroad .
These reserves , to which the authorities resort mas@@ sively to support the local currency , the h@@ ry@@ v@@ nia , collap@@ sing , the agency is increasingly likely to de@@ value , thereby inf@@ l@@ ating its external debt .
Ki@@ ev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia , which acc@@ uses it of not paying a bill of $ 8@@ 82 million .
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power at a time of severe tension with its Russian neighbour , which is fu@@ rious about Ki@@ ev signing an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had been in the fifth quarter of a year of contr@@ action between July and September .
Its debt , which is still relatively modest , has so@@ ared in recent years , and S &amp; P estimates it to 3@@ 3.5 % of GDP , with less than 10 % before the 2008-@@ 2009 crisis .
The country , in the budget deficit , has for months been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund , which gave it a credit of USD 15@@ .@@ 3 billion in 2010 , and for the time being only EUR 3.@@ 4 billion .
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tran@@ che until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , notably by increasing gas prices to the population .
After a new failed mission in the country , the IMF saw this week that &quot; large external financing needs &quot; were &quot; a vulnerability &quot; , while at the same time raising &quot; signs of economic improvement . &quot;
However , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r J@@ ol@@ oud , the Centre for Political Stu@@ dies , &apos; we cannot expect a short-term improvement &apos; .
&apos;@@ There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-@@ election year &apos; , with the presidential elections scheduled for 2015 , is the expert , inter@@ viewed at the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
In addition , there is the &apos; uncertainty &apos; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which Brussels is conditional on the release of the opposition Yu@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
&apos;@@ St@@ reng@@ th@@ ening the agreement would be positive for long-term trade , but there may be negative short@@ - and medium-term negative consequences related to the reaction of Russia &apos; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &apos; trade restrictions &apos; from Moscow .
Russia , which represents a quarter of Ukraine &apos;s exports , has warned that , in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Ki@@ ev , it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods .
America ’ s Green Paper
P@@ u@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m have said Friday that they have not received any objections from the US authorities to their merger , moving closer to the creation of the first world advertising agency .
The merger does indeed bring the second world agency , O@@ m@@ n@@ co@@ m , and the third , P@@ u@@ si@@ ci@@ is .
&apos;@@ O@@ m@@ nic@@ co@@ m Group and Public Group have today announced the expiry of the deadline for examination of the previously announced merger of P@@ u@@ lic@@ ci@@ as Group and O@@ m@@ nic@@ co@@ m , provided for by the Har@@ t-@@ Scot@@ t-@@ Ro@@ d@@ ino An@@ dean Act of 197@@ 6 , as amended &apos; , announcing the two groups in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
They specify that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the deadline for the UK H@@ S@@ R examination period and the authorisation decisions issued in other juris@@ dic@@ tions meet several of the conditions required for the operation of the operation .
&apos;@@ merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and approving the shareholders of both groups &apos; .
The Congolese army
The Congolese army ( F@@ ARC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to ro@@ b the rebels from M@@ 23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u bordering Rwanda and Uganda .
M@@ 23 seems to be on the ver@@ ge of being beaten after being driven away from loc@@ alities in the north-@@ east of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) that he has controlled since the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insur@@ gency .
&apos;@@ We shall continue with M@@ 23 and carry it out wherever it is hiding because it is criminals &apos; , told Re@@ u@@ ters Col@@ on@@ el O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokes@@ person for the F@@ ARC .
We must not allow them to re@@ organise themselves because they have been mar@@ ching the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace back .
Those responsible for M@@ 23 have explained that they have evac@@ uated the loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure and Ber@@ tr@@ d B@@ is@@ sim@@ wa , the political leader of the re@@ bel@@ lion , said on the R@@ FI that these military set@@ backs would not alter his demands for peace talks .
The latter , according to the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , took on Wednesday in K@@ amp@@ ala between the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 .
S@@ hor@@ t@@ ages are reported in the h@@ ills that dominate B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the last loc@@ ality in the hands of the insur@@ gents to be dropped this week , as well as around R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a h@@ ill in which the re@@ bel@@ lion of M@@ 23 came to light in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , ma@@ ster@@ y of North Ki@@ v@@ u province , prof@@ iting from the flight of the government gar@@ ris@@ on and the p@@ assi@@ vity of the Mon@@ us@@ co peace@@ keepers .
The fall of G@@ om@@ a led to the United Nations Mission in the DR@@ C , the world &apos;s largest in terms of staffing , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention bri@@ g@@ ade composed of South African , Mal@@ ay and T@@ anz@@ anian soldiers .
For its part , the F@@ ARC headquarters has been res@@ hu@@ ff@@ led , and the army has moved on to the offensive against M@@ 23 , changing the course of war .
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;@@ The M@@ 23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predicted a Congolese business expert , J@@ ose Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Si@@ ast@@ a .
That would be historic – it would be the first time that the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa managed to fight a major insur@@ gency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group ally in Rwanda would be in the east of the DR@@ C .
UN experts accuse Rwanda , which is fier@@ cely den@@ i@@ fying it , of milit@@ arily supporting M@@ 23 , which was originally formed by former Congolese military soldiers .
British diplomacy , Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , invited Rw@@ and@@ an President Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to show restraint , announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office .
Last week K@@ ig@@ ali referred to the possibility of military re@@ pris@@ als following the sh@@ ell@@ s in Rwanda .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana inv@@ aded the streets of the bour@@ g@@ ade to welcome the entry of the F@@ ARC soldiers .
&apos;@@ We have lived a year with M@@ 23 and we seemed un@@ imagin@@ able to be released by the army one day &apos; , testi@@ fies to a person in this neighbouring town of Uganda .
&apos;@@ We lived in terror ( of M@@ 23 ) , we are tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tised &apos; , added that man .
The tests carried out by the P@@ ast@@ er Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the cor@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ us were negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &apos; the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date &apos; .
M@@ od@@ i , this 43 year-old patient had been suspected of being reached , after returning from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed 50 deaths .
The second American oil company , Ch@@ ev@@ ron , reported on Friday a drop in its quar@@ terly benefit due to the fall in its refin@@ ing margins , while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining behind the group &apos;s objectives .
Its net benefit in the third quarter has fallen to $ 4.@@ 95 billion , or $ 2.@@ 57 per action , compared to $ 5.@@ 25 billion , or $ 2.@@ 69 per year .
The analy@@ sts asked by Re@@ u@@ ters aver@@ aged an average of $ 2.@@ 71 .
The group has produced 2.@@ 59 million bar@@ rel@@ s of oil equivalent per day in the quarter , rising compared to 2.@@ 52 million b@@ ones produced a year ago .
The company is aiming at 2.@@ 65 million b@@ ones for this year , with a 25 % growth in production expected by 201@@ 7 .
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas projects in Australia .
Due to the cost of these projects , annual investment spending has increased by $ 7 billion in two years and is expected to reach $ 3@@ 6.@@ 7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of down@@ stream activities ( including refin@@ ing and chemical production ) fell from 45 % to $ 3@@ 80 million .
This reduction in refin@@ ing margins affects the whole sector .
As a result , Ch@@ ev@@ ron ’ s main competi@@ tor , Ex@@ xon Mob@@ il , reported on Thursday of a net net benefit , despite rising gas and oil production .
F@@ rei@@ ght of school@@ lin@@ ers : the complaint deemed admissible
The College of S@@ her@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( S@@ R@@ R@@ S ) has been demanding the costs of $ 150 per student from the early school year ( up to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for school pupils to two homes , a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so .
Before the changes to the last budget , no financial contribution was made .
&apos;@@ There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested &apos; , explains Mrs L@@ ef@@ in .
According to her , S@@ CA@@ R@@ S was invited to mediation , and she asked for another time to reflect on it .
&apos;@@ It is always better to talk about it , to talk and to find solutions &apos; , says Mrs L@@ ef@@ in .
The academic Commission of the College of S@@ her@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( CS@@ R@@ S ) did not wish to comment .
The organisation has only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint .
Im@@ bro@@ g@@ li@@ o about the closure of the topical and urgent debate
In the face of the fron@@ t@@ loading for several months by a number of staff and several trade unions , including the G@@ T@@ T , the Minister for Health , Mar@@ is@@ ol T@@ our@@ o , decided on 10 July to &apos; dis@@ rupt the timetable for the implementation of the project , and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which cannot take place on 4 November &apos; .
An official request is made &apos; to do not run any risk to the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &apos; , but which was also intended not to hinder the election campaign in a few months &apos; time from the municipalities .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should nonetheless be effective on that date .
Even if , in the A@@ PH@@ P , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As of 4 November , the fire bri@@ g@@ ade who held around a quarter of the 40 000 annual pass@@ ages for the emergencies of the H@@ end@@ el@@ -@@ God will all have received a sign of taking the 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of inter@@ na@@ tives .
In the H@@ end@@ el@@ -@@ God , the internal ur@@ gencies of ur@@ gencies will leave on Monday to five internal medicine .
As for the transfer of the be@@ ds of internal medicine , it is scheduled for this month .
&apos;@@ The reception service of the H@@ end@@ el@@ -@@ God emergencies must be closed in the shor@@ test possible time , and for us it is 4 November &apos; , to ensure that the chairman of the A@@ P@@ M &apos;s Committee on Med@@ ical Medic@@ inal Affairs ( EM@@ S ) , which supports the management project , is un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable .
&apos;@@ On 4 November , there will be no more patients brought by the fire bri@@ g@@ ades , only people coming from their own means &apos; , confirms Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical officer of the new H@@ end@@ el@@ -@@ God .
&apos;@@ But we will continue to welcome patients as a matter of urgency &apos; , but he is saying that there is a permanent presence of M@@ U@@ R vehicles there in order to transfer serious cases .
Sen@@ ior j@@ uni@@ or doctors will remain on the ground .
But it is up to the AR@@ S to decide the closure of the emergency service .
&apos;@@ Things are gradually being done &apos; , answers Nicol@@ as Pe@@ j@@ u , the spokes@@ person for the AR@@ S for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in service terms . &apos;
&apos;@@ The Minister li@@ ed to us or li@@ ed to him &apos; , deplo@@ res the Ukrainian doctor , Mrs Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek .
As a leader of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R leader at the beginning of July for leading the way against the re@@ organisation project , he is defined as an &apos; ear@@ ly-@@ warning &apos; against a &apos; cy@@ n@@ ic &apos; decision taken by the &apos; medi@@ a-@@ administrative &apos; techno@@ structure .
&apos;@@ They are in the process of v@@ ying and suff@@ oc@@ ating ur@@ gencies that were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &apos; , he considers .
For him , &apos; if the other Paris emergencies could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &apos; .
However , they are regularly eng@@ ul@@ fed .
For example , there are sometimes nine waiting hours for the emergencies of L@@ ari@@ b@@ is@@ i@@ ère .
In the AR@@ S , it is argued that 30 &apos; dis@@ pat@@ ched &apos; patients on several sites are not in danger of representing an &apos; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &apos; in other emergency services , whose human resources have also been strengthened .
In both the AR@@ S and the A@@ PH@@ P , we are defending the &apos; new hospital model &apos; which has already been launched since 7 October and which should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , liberal practi@@ tioners should also be involved in the establishment of a &apos; permanent healthcare &apos; .
&apos;@@ Where are we going to be asked if people are asked to diagno@@ se themselves &apos; , the question is , is G@@ ér@@ in Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek , who &apos; the concept of a serious emergency &apos; is &apos; dangerous &apos; and is a &apos; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &apos; ?
This is going to happen as for the level of maternity .
People are not mad , they will go where there is the best offer of care .
If the Minister does not take action by Monday , we are going to change the po@@ et , protect Chris@@ top@@ her P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , doctor doctor and member of the S@@ G@@ T .
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list .
In N@@ ath@@ ia Ko@@ sci@@ us@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ oriz@@ et &apos;s team , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , U@@ M@@ P coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in Paris and elected from the 4@@ th r@@ ank , it is clear that &apos; even if the Paris P@@ M@@ P was in favour of maintaining ur@@ gencies in H@@ é@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God , it would be technically and financially impossible to re@@ open them if you are responsible &apos; .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the PS candidate , again reminded France on Monday morning that she was in favour of a moratorium so that there is no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark its net disagreement , emphasises B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , its spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of the Ho@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God has its legitimacy in substance , we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to put an end to the ta@@ pping on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicating an American official on Thursday .
This decision is part of the White House ’ s attempt to take up the matter in the case of N@@ SA ’ s ta@@ pping after the re@@ vel@@ ations made by former analy@@ st Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , a refugee in Russia .
This is the first time that the IMF and World Bank surveillance of the World Bank has been mentioned since the start of the scandal .
Inter@@ ro@@ lled on the subject , a US administration official replied : &quot; The US does not carry out electronic surveillance of the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &quot; .
As a result of an@@ onym@@ ity , this official did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past .
Another official told him that Barack Obama has given an order to stop these practices in the past weeks .
This in@@ struction was given at the same time as that ending the ta@@ pping of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , the United Nations Int@@ elli@@ gence Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday , but allowed them to continue .
The committee introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new targets for combating poverty
The United Nations will now set to work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( M@@ DGs ) , which were set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world .
Austr@@ ali@@ an diplomats have played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” aimed at replacing the M@@ DGs , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began on the eve of Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They were in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to “ overcome national interests . ”
‘ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process for establishing universal sustainable development goals ( O@@ D@@ D ) , he added .
These O@@ D@@ D@@ s will be based on progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the M@@ DGs .
The security of Mozambique is growing at the same time as there are conflicts between powerful figures .
On the feet of the S@@ cus@@ a M@@ ach@@ el stat@@ ue , the foun@@ der President of Mozambique , in to@@ ying them , thousands of people gathered in the centre of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to for peaceful slog@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
&apos;@@ We want peace to return ; we want stability &apos; , said V@@ an@@ ess@@ a de Sou@@ sa , Director-General of an Investment Society .
In@@ qu@@ is@@ te for the future of his country , she has exchanged her working clo@@ thes against a te@@ e-@@ shir@@ t with the mention of &apos; We want security &apos; in Portuguese before joining the crow@@ ded crow@@ d in the place of Independence of the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there has been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and the Ren@@ o , the worst con@@ sign@@ ments since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago .
The Ren@@ o was once a famous rebel movement , supported initially by R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia ruled by wh@@ ites and then South Africa ’ s apar@@ theid government as part of efforts to destabili@@ ze the country ’ s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
An@@ aly@@ sts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy , as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-@@ west could attract more than $ 50 M@@ DGs in the next few years from companies like Rio T@@ into , Brazil , Italy , Italy , and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko of the United States .
The F@@ ili@@ m@@ o , the ruling party , and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and the Ren@@ o , are shifting responsibility for tensions .
The Ren@@ o says that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , a traditional bas@@ tion of the Ren@@ o , on 17 October .
The assa@@ ults on the former rebels then de@@ generated when government forces attacked the foundations of the Ren@@ o and tried to kill A@@ f@@ on@@ so D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the leader of the group , and Fer@@ nan@@ do Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , the spokesman for the Ren@@ o , according to the Financial Times .
The government is making it responsible for trigg@@ ering conflicts and acc@@ using it of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to minimise concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za said on Wednesday to the A@@ F@@ P , the French press agency , that Mr D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama regarded himself as a &apos; los@@ er &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions in government &apos; .
The F@@ ili@@ m@@ o and the Ren@@ o insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern was growing after Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that the Ren@@ o is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .
He told the F@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the F@@ ili@@ m@@ o .
“ We want to resume the negotiations , but with the utmost seriousness , ” Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
Pre@@ vious discussions between the parties have failed to ease the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year .
“ They are two great men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) , who do not stop arguing , ” explained Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ ann@@ on , a conf@@ er of Mozambique ’ s open and specialist university .
None of them knows well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
The Ren@@ o , which is in favour of electoral reform , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a trea@@ sure of war on the part of the government .
The share of the R@@ ene@@ w@@ ed votes has been falling since 1992 , while a new party , the Mozambique Democratic Movement ( M@@ D@@ M ) , which was created by a former Ren@@ o member , should obtain more votes in the elections .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&apos;@@ He does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency &apos; , said Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a .
We do not know exactly what the Ren@@ o &apos;s capacity is , but it has led to sha@@ ky attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-@@ south motor@@ way route .
Most of the con@@ sign@@ ments took place in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , which is located several hundred kilometres in the north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where Be@@ ira is located , where mining companies , including Rio T@@ into and V@@ ale , export coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Ren@@ o threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was somewhat ti@@ mid when he asked whether the Ren@@ o would return to this threat .
The Ren@@ o wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , ” Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
In@@ stability has strengthened the fru@@ stra@@ tions of the government , dec@@ la@@ res Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , Director of Medic@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media society , and many people are also concerned about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
“ People believe that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the President , and that it is up to him to find solutions to the problems , ” he explained .
Om@@ ar S@@ ul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstration , said that people only wanted stability .
“ No one ca@@ res about the Ren@@ o or the F@@ ili@@ m@@ o , they just want to return to peace , they want free access to the roads , ” he added .
We should be teaching the my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds of children as &apos; lifestyle models &apos; , says the author .
T@@ ho@@ r ’ s L@@ é@@ rence could show that “ the brutal force does not carry the weight of sub@@ tle ru@@ ins , ” while the Ar@@ th@@ ur@@ ans reveal the importance of having a dream .
To say that many my@@ ths would be “ far too violent , far too scandalous , and in some cases far too obscure to be taught at school , ” Cro@@ sa@@ y@@ -@@ Holland advocated “ careful selection ” of works adapted to age .
“ I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
I have been advocating this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “ openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic ” means that children “ completely cross ” , with messages being “ sub@@ li@@ ed ” in pleasant stories .
Cro@@ at Holland , which transl@@ ates Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon and wrote The Pen@@ gu@@ in Bo@@ ok of Nor@@ se My@@ th@@ s and British Fo@@ k T@@ ales , said : “ You may have good intentions , but you want to keep them out of sight . ”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writ@@ er who writ@@ es for adults and an adult writ@@ er who writ@@ es for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything should be simplified or end well , but there is an un@@ born sense of good and evil .
And it must be sub@@ li@@ ed ; revealed through history rather than declared .
The basis for what is being demonstrated and not said .
A figh@@ ter of the Hamas armed branch was killed this evening and another w@@ ounded by an Israeli sho@@ ot in the Gaza Strip , learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a sh@@ ell@@ s from an Israeli Israeli arm@@ chair .
N@@ SA : The US has gone too far .
The US has sometimes gone &apos; too far &apos; in sp@@ ying , recognised Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in this first Washington admission to Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the US and its European allies , this is the first time that a US government official explicitly ad@@ mits controversial practices in the N@@ SA inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;@@ In some cases , I conc@@ ede to you , as the President has done , some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to make sure that this does not happen in the future &apos; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London that he attended from Washington on Thursday 31 October by video .
In his speech back , in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , the head of US diplomacy gave a great deal of justification to intelligence and information collection practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ ting the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry ensured that the US authorities had since stri@@ pped numerous terrorist attacks , thanks to communications inter@@ c@@ eption and information collection .
&apos;@@ We have made it impossible for aircraft to fall , for buildings to explo@@ de and for people to be murdered , because we were able to be informed in advance of these projects &apos; , argued the bos@@ s of American diplomacy .
And , as John Ker@@ ry said to Europeans , &apos; I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been mis@@ led &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;@@ And yes , in some cases , it went too far too far &apos; , still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured us on Thursday evening that President Obama was &apos; resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that nobody feels dec@@ eived &apos; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to so@@ ar this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
The newspaper , which quot@@ es documents from the former consul@@ tant of the N@@ SA Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , states that the programme known as &apos; M@@ US@@ C@@ U@@ LA@@ R &apos; , and led with the British counterpart of the N@@ SA , G@@ C@@ H@@ Q , allows these two agencies to recover data from the op@@ tical fi@@ bre used by Internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , some 18@@ 1 million elements were collected in the last month of January , ranging from me@@ als to e-@@ ma@@ ils , elements of text or audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ cep@@ tions would take place outside the US .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google have denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , and Italy have revealed that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted a massive inter@@ cep@@ t of data and communications from US allies and leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states , while lea@@ ks in the US press claimed that the US President was not aware of such listened , Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
By contrast , the bos@@ s of the powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ e@@ ith Alexander , denied him that his intelligence agency cap@@ tured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that would have taken up these communications before providing them with the N@@ SA .
This would be about &apos; military operations &apos; in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the United States , and that would definitely not be in Europe , and said General Alexander .
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia has convened the Austr@@ ali@@ an Ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international es@@ pion@@ age network that has also caused China to be heard .
The Paris Sain@@ t Ge@@ g will receive L@@ ori@@ ent on Friday without his master asset , the Swed@@ e Z@@ la@@ tan I@@ bra@@ h@@ im@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , announ@@ ces the League of League in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
The P@@ S@@ G , the leader of the cham@@ pion@@ ship in Mon@@ ac@@ o with the difference of purpose , spread the list of players who were detained for this 12@@ th day match , without the attack of 32 years .
The communi@@ qu@@ é simply says that he is &apos; injured &apos; , without specifying the nature of the injury .
However , he was suffering from an inf@@ lam@@ ation of the left of the left when he returned , at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony
The Fa@@ ther &apos;s cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um organis@@ es , at 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the de@@ mar@@ c@@ ated de@@ mar@@ ches in his establishment during the year .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , a Socialist candidate in the Paris City , must attend , and then , at a press conference , she will explain her proposals for fun@@ eral .
To follow the ceremony , c@@ lic@@ king above .
For their own dar@@ k@@ ness , more and more French people choose cre@@ am , rather than hum@@ ination : 53 % , according to an I@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people , instead of 47 % .
But the opposite is the case : the French prefer in@@ hum@@ ation ( 53 % versus 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book , the Mor@@ t in the ashes , Dam@@ an@@ te Le Gu@@ ay , the philosop@@ her and vice-@@ chairman of the National Committee of E@@ th@@ n@@ ic E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &apos; violence &apos; of the creation , for the survi@@ v@@ ors .
There is , with the cre@@ ed , &apos; violence against the loved body &apos; , which is going to be &apos; reduced to a lot of ash &apos; in a very short time , not after a process of dec@@ ay , which &apos; would accompany the phases of m@@ our@@ ning &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which is based on the &apos; er@@ asing of the sing@@ ular and distinc@@ tive signs &apos; reduced to the &apos; an@@ onym@@ ity &apos; of the ash .
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Pro@@ te@@ stant countries ?
&apos;@@ Because the creation is a new fact &apos; , Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ é@@ ri@@ que B@@ ac@@ é , chair@@ woman of the th@@ an@@ at@@ ology Society and the Bo@@ ok of Bo@@ ok of Bo@@ ok Ap@@ pe@@ al .
It has only been tolerated since 196@@ 3 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to ap@@ portion it .
To call for the creation is for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mic@@ ho@@ d-@@ N@@ ér@@ ard , Director General of the fun@@ eral Services of the City of Paris , to provide for the de@@ func@@ t of a ceremony as worthy as the one he would be entitled to .
The I@@ p@@ so@@ s annual survey shows a strong commitment to organising the ceremony .
77 % of the French want one , for their loved ones , be religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of those who have chosen a creat@@ or want a ceremony .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s want it .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ ums have adapted to this development in society .
&apos;@@ For ten years , they have been trying to avoid the violence of a wait for families , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the surrender of the ash &apos; , observed Mr Mic@@ ho@@ d-@@ N@@ ér@@ ard .
70 % of the institutions now offer cere@@ mon@@ ial ma@@ sters , who carry out , in the presence of the body , the following rit@@ ual : to host the assembly , to name the de@@ func@@ t , to link it to others , to talk about it , to give meaning to its death and to organise the f@@ are@@ well .
This is the case with the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the L@@ ate L@@ as@@ c@@ ise , since 1998 .
The ma@@ sters of ceremony are often people who have re@@ converted .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that the Fa@@ ther &apos;s cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um has been organising , since 2010 , the day of the T@@ ous@@ ain@@ t , several cere@@ monies of memory , secular and non-@@ religious , to which he inv@@ ites the families of the people who have been set up in the year .
For the second con@@ secu@@ tive year , one of these cere@@ monies is passed on to those who cannot travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um has allowed us to take it up .
In the S@@ ey@@ ne , for reasons of ra@@ ids
At the beginning of the week , a family left its a@@ partment on the ground of the F@@ ru@@ ti@@ or D@@ 2 building , because of the presence of r@@ ats .
In view of the urgency of the situation , the Director of the South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at Office , the director of the South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at office , has proposed , exceptionally and temporarily , that the couple and three children be re@@ located in a T@@ 4 .
Yet the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons &apos; and the situation is blocked .
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions , estimates Jo@@ l Can@@ ap@@ a , the head of the office .
There have always been r@@ ats , there has always been in the cities .
The corpor@@ ation company is carrying out two pass@@ ages per year and , in addition , we are dealing with every request from the inhabitants .
We have made 64 speeches since the end of last winter .
The neigh@@ bor@@ hood is not left behind , and the ra@@ ys do not sp@@ ill over into the city .
For reasons of the protection of the environment and public health , the proceeds of den@@ sity are four times less efficient than in the past , certainly , but for two r@@ ats we are not going to kill a go@@ ose .
&apos;@@ We did not get the r@@ ats at home &apos; , defend the father of the family who left his house to settle for the ho@@ tel .
We are soon without a s@@ lack and we are waiting for a new housing , at the same tariff as the old one .
The To@@ k@@ yo Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change
The To@@ k@@ yo Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics .
The Co@@ te has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen , which is detrimental to exporting values and the warning about its annual outcome launched by S@@ ony on Thursday .
The Ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i index lost 12@@ 6.@@ 37 points ( 0.@@ 88 % ) to 14 201@@ .@@ 57 and T@@ op@@ i@@ x yiel@@ ded 1@@ 1.@@ 23 points ( 0.@@ 94 % ) to 1 18@@ 3.@@ 03 .
S@@ ony fell by more than 11 % to 1 6@@ 68 .
A house pre@@ y
A fire that started on Friday l@@ un@@ ch@@ time in the Qu@@ een Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c was quickly controlled .
More than 30 fire@@ fighters were sent to 9 from the He@@ br@@ ert street .
The fl@@ ames have declared themselves in a home of three houses in four floor areas behind the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c court .
All ten@@ ants were absent from the fire .
The fire was ma@@ pped out an hour after the arrival of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , many of whom were speaking .
As soon as our first fire@@ fighters arrived , they really saw the apparent smoke .
&apos;@@ So the al@@ arms have succeeded , because it took the building to attack the building , because it was buildings col@@ oured here &apos; , explained France , the spokesman for the fi@@ re-@@ fighters in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire .
Ben Green@@ man
It might be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand@@ -@@ up in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the de@@ vice of the v@@ ou@@ d@@ le Fr@@ ank F@@ ay , who held the role of ceremony leader in the Pal@@ ace The@@ at@@ or , on Bro@@ ad@@ way , began to tell the public directly about the tone of the convers@@ ation .
F@@ ay ’ s innovation has continued over the years , until the New York F@@ es@@ ti@@ ly F@@ es@@ ti@@ val has been resumed more recently .
C@@ reat@@ ed and over@@ seen by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ sch , the foun@@ der of the Car@@ ol@@ ines standard club , the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectac@@ les presented in small clubs and large theat@@ res .
“ Most of the heads of post@@ er have emerged in Car@@ ol@@ ines , and have had great success , until they become too famous to play in a club , ” said H@@ ir@@ sch .
We have created this f@@ es@@ ti@@ val with the aim of continuing to work with them .
This year &apos;s event will see the participation of W@@ anda Sy@@ k@@ es , K@@ ath@@ y G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in and Bill Mah@@ er and the presentation of &apos; Stan@@ d U@@ p for Her@@ es &apos; , a evening of com@@ edy and music to the former combat@@ ants , who are organised in the Mad@@ ison Square Gar@@ den , to whom , among others , B@@ ru@@ ce S@@ pre@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , Ro@@ ger Wa@@ ters and Bill C@@ os@@ by .
The f@@ es@@ ti@@ val has grown , as has the world of the com@@ edi@@ ve .
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s f@@ es@@ ti@@ val have gone through non-@@ traditional cir@@ cu@@ its , for example by showing spectac@@ les on small television channels , such as Com@@ ed@@ y Central , F@@ X and S@@ pi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ ro@@ l@@ l appeared on the front of the scene in a t@@ as@@ co@@ m on a c@@ able chain ( “ The League ” on the subject of the jo@@ y@@ fully l@@ ac@@ y F@@ X@@ X fant@@ asy ) and now has his own spectac@@ le of sk@@ et@@ ch@@ s on Central Central .
Jen@@ y S@@ la@@ te took part in the “ S@@ ura Ni@@ gh@@ t Li@@ ve ” programme and was part of the “ Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation ” series , but she is more known for his series of vi@@ br@@ al vide@@ os “ Mar@@ c@@ el the S@@ hell with S@@ ho@@ es . ”
K@@ ro@@ l@@ l and S@@ la@@ te , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans to the sing@@ ular vote ( the sur@@ real pessimis@@ m An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k , the ir@@ ony of racial justice in the United K@@ am@@ u Bel@@ l ) , are pur@@ ses of the decentr@@ alized world of the American com@@ edy .
One of the main attr@@ actions of the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val this year will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg discussing with Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg began as a stand@@ -@@ up com@@ edy , but he has become a film and television film ma@@ ker , as well as an u@@ no@@ fficial histor@@ ian of the com@@ edi@@ e .
Between 2005 and 2007 , he en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated a T@@ V L@@ and program that called “ S@@ it D@@ ow@@ n Com@@ ed@@ y ” David Ste@@ in@@ berg .
The meeting takes place at the Ho@@ tel de V@@ ille in the centre of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ The city is definitively in the com@@ ic DNA of all the work of Lar@@ ry , ” said Ste@@ in@@ berg .
He told me that , when he was here , sometimes he des@@ cen@@ ded into a ru@@ il between two buildings and said , if I lose all my money , perhaps I will live here .
Oil prices
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday , while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that China ’ s energy-@@ intensive manufacturing sector is being strengthened .
The price of the US benchmark for delivery in December fell from 14 c@@ ents to $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 per bar@@ rel in Europe in electronic exchange on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Ex@@ change ( N@@ Y@@ ME@@ X ) .
The contract lost 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it with a 5.@@ 8 % drop in October .
The abund@@ ant supply of crude oil has been on the price in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy indicated on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China ’ s economic recovery could continue to grow after growth rose to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the last quarter .
G@@ ross B@@ rent , a reference to international crude oil already used by US refin@@ eries , has lost 26 c@@ ents to fall to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 per bar@@ rel on International Ex@@ change Ex@@ change in London .
L@@ im@@ iting the right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as
A Federal Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al restored certain restrictions on the voluntary termination of pregnancy which had been blocked by a first-@@ instance judge this week .
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that state and calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The ruling by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that doctors who will be practi@@ sing I@@ V@@ G will have to have an &apos; admission privilege &apos; to local hospitals .
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , under his status as a care@@ ta@@ ker member of a hospital , to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates of the I@@ V@@ G argue that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of one third of state clin@@ ics , because these clin@@ ics have failed to obtain this &quot; admission privilege &quot; for their practi@@ tioners .
In total , it would be about 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments .
On Monday , a judge of first instance estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions on the admission privilege were un@@ constitutional .
But the At@@ tor@@ ney General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican , Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who is the govern@@ or of govern@@ or , asked the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to cancel the first-@@ instance judgment that blocked law enforcement .
A plenary session on this issue is scheduled for January .
The New Sta@@ r succeeded in a return in force , side by side , with 1.3 million view@@ ers behind their television post , or 5.@@ 6 % of audience .
But was the spectac@@ le at the meeting ?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves to the hearings of this 10@@ th season , to face the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ e , the S@@ inc@@ er , the per@@ former of An@@ dr@@ é Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
Many were disappointed by the exc@@ itement to return to their fav@@ our@@ ite agenda .
But why so much disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As every year , the first broad@@ casts of hearing include a broad choice of we@@ eds , for the better and sometimes for the worse .
Yet , on T@@ wit@@ ter , we want spectac@@ le , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fortunately , some of them have found them .
Many of them have tried the New Sta@@ r , and sometimes even went to the end .
Beh@@ ind the television scre@@ ens , there is still a successful s@@ ong vo@@ ter , season after season .
Others have just the ambition to lau@@ gh .
The Court blocked a decision on the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D &apos;s control and search policy
A Federal Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al blocked a judge ’ s decision on Thursday demanding changes in the control and search programme of the New York Police Department and drew it up .
The US Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) has indicated that Jud@@ ge S@@ hi@@ ra Sch@@ ee@@ lin &apos;s decision was suspended until the city &apos;s appeal was taken .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and inter@@ rog@@ ate citizens .
The city has appe@@ aled to its conclusions and corrective orders , including a decision to allocate a contro@@ ller to help the police department change its policy and the associated training programme .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al heard the arguments on the request for suspension on Tuesday .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al has stated that the judge should be drawn from the dossier because it infring@@ ed the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of a biased approach , partly because of a series of discussions on the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court &apos;s criticisms .
The judge ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mis@@ ta@@ k@@ enly targeting black men and women in their control and search programmes .
It has appointed an external contro@@ ller to supervise the changes , including the reform of policies , training and supervision , and it has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cam@@ er@@ as on the body in areas where the greatest number of checks are carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the city &apos;s appeal should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The control and search tactics have been criticised by many defenders of civil rights .
This system of control and sear@@ ches has been in place for decades in some form , but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ berg , in order to achieve its highest historical level in 2011 with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls that mainly related to black and white men .
Ju@@ dic@@ ial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Those who advocate changes in the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D ’ s control and search programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices , make it possible to have more effective and tru@@ sting police forces , and to change the way in which police departments use policy .
Op@@ ponents say that these changes would undermine the mor@@ ale of the police without reducing crime , would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police forces were severely reduced over the last decade .
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but that it reformed the way in which the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its controls .
The ten@@ ants have to vote , because each of them pays on average $ 100 a month on the price of housing that goes to the V@@ ille .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ ,000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des that amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes .
In voting , we are sending a clear message .
We need to change things to the V@@ ille .
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay fire@@ works to $ 100 000 , land of $ 4 to 5 million , if ...
G@@ o to vote , that is the best way to speak and say that it is enough .
E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e
S@@ hor@@ ted in the 500 m@@ 2 of el@@ y@@ se@@ an k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens as committed after working in embassies , the co@@ ok has clim@@ bed all the lad@@ der to the head , nine years ago .
He served six French presidents , from Ge@@ org@@ es P@@ om@@ pid@@ ou to Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de to Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , including in their holiday places , and fed an inc@@ al@@ cul@@ able number of large parts of the world in a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ an@@ onym@@ ity that he is only now facing , at the age of 60 .
The man with open face , un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited , and intellectual , born on 24 October 195@@ 3 at the Fer@@ te@@ -@@ Sain@@ t Au@@ bi@@ n , is the holder of a P@@ R .
His mother was co@@ o@@ king herself in a cast@@ le of S@@ olo@@ gna .
&apos;@@ I have gone from a cast@@ le to the other ! &apos; , ir@@ on@@ ise Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ gel , who is familiar not only with the bi@@ kes of the six presidents for whom he has officer , but also from their wi@@ ves and some of their gu@@ ests .
&apos;@@ It is always the head of the state or his or her compan@@ ion or wife who choo@@ ses the men@@ u &apos; .
&apos;@@ Mrs Chirac was a little more involved , she came directly into k@@ it@@ ch@@ en &apos; , to the point that she banned women in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e k@@ ills !
B@@ eli@@ eving the heads of state with relative indifference to land fe@@ eds , &apos; they are all gre@@ edy &apos; , denoun@@ ces Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ res &apos; kind of words .
Jacques Chirac certainly had &apos; a slightly more developed appe@@ ti@@ te &apos; .
But , with Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , who had removed che@@ ese , the be@@ ds were empty !
As for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de , who has restored che@@ ese , &apos; it is someone who likes to eat &apos; and &apos; there is little that he does not like &apos; .
The current head of state , who reg@@ ain@@ ed the kil@@ os lost before the presidential campaign , has “ no demand for specific arrangements . ”
Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ ts also re@@ members the pressure on his shoulders , particularly at the state din@@ ner in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e , which is to be used &apos; between 200 and 250 people in an hour &apos; .
The night before is almost white .
These people would not understand if there were mistakes .
The former head of the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e k@@ it@@ ch@@ en , who took a glass on Tuesday evening with his team , family , and friends , with a ch@@ or@@ us at heart , Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de came to welcome me .
He said praise .
&quot; The human side has emerged , &quot; he says .
The leader will be replaced by his deputy , Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me G@@ om@@ z , 35 years old , who has been in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e for the seven@@ teen years .
In a house built in 18@@ 50 in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c
An historic house built in 18@@ 50 was the pre@@ y of fl@@ ames in the Qu@@ een Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c on Friday l@@ un@@ ch@@ time .
The four housing buildings on the 15 of the He@@ br@@ ert street were the subject of three al@@ arms at the fire service .
The fire has been declared before , but it has been on the three shel@@ ves of the building .
France , the spokesman for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c Protection Service , has made it clear that the rapid intervention of the fire bri@@ g@@ ades has prevented the spread of fl@@ ames to ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where buildings are built in a closer fashion .
The bur@@ ned house had four homes , but no ten@@ ants were at the scene at the time of the fire .
The damage has been limited , even if water has caused damage .
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin , but the undermine of a criminal act has been removed by the down@@ side .
Wall Street
Martin S@@ c@@ or@@ ese leaves a few images of his next film , whose head@@ line , that of an ambitious New York bro@@ ker , is embo@@ died by Leonardo Di@@ Cas@@ pri@@ o .
For@@ get to be reasonable and leave your notes .
Leonardo Di@@ g@@ pri@@ o is going to see you in his role as a l@@ unch tr@@ ick .
Martin S@@ c@@ or@@ ese is telling us the real story of a &apos; L@@ ong Is@@ land L@@ ong Is@@ land &apos; , which refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a huge corruption case on Wall Street .
In the 1980 ’ s , J@@ ord@@ an Bel@@ for@@ t was a s@@ na@@ p that will make him a rich , rich man .
The opportunity to follow its un@@ believ@@ able rise , but also the st@@ agg@@ ering fall .
Without limits , the man is en@@ countering f@@ es@@ tivities , women and drugs .
S@@ ucc@@ ess and excesses of all kinds are the words of this ins@@ ane history .
The S@@ c@@ or@@ es@@ e-@@ Di@@ di@@ pri@@ o couple seems to have found the magic of the magic of the magic in S@@ hu@@ t@@ ter Is@@ land .
The way out of the new S@@ c@@ or@@ ese has been delayed because of its too long mon@@ ster .
It would appear that the film la@@ sts at 2.@@ 45 p.m.
In the Chamber on 25 December , he will be able to play a fair part in the co@@ aches race .
The C@@ ou@@ l@@ on used the telephone piracy to check a tu@@ mul@@ t .
The former ed@@ itor of Ne@@ ws of the World An@@ dy C@@ ou@@ l@@ son would have used “ Internet piracy , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a bi@@ don tu@@ mul@@ t on a link involving the then Interior Minister , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
The Prosecutor An@@ drew E@@ d@@ is Q@@ C told the tribunal of the O@@ ld B@@ ai@@ ley that Ne@@ ws of the World heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ an@@ na@@ h P@@ w@@ l@@ by , his “ fine special advis@@ er . ”
It was pointed out to the court that the newspaper responsible for G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ c@@ aire , a private de@@ vice , ha@@ c@@ ked into P@@ w@@ le@@ by &apos;s voice box and &apos; constantly pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing him in his own do@@ or@@ step &apos; , but C@@ ou@@ l@@ son also called it and left voice messages .
‘ The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ ou@@ il@@ son , who is now the ed@@ itor of No@@ t@@ W , is not the kind of man to stay in front of people ’ s house in the hope of sur@@ prises , it is the kind of man to love the history of the people to see what they say , Mr E@@ d@@ is said .
He said that No@@ t@@ W used three ways to investigate the subjects : telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation .
The ed@@ itor is personally involved in the third .
It is obvious that he is aware of the second , supervision , that cannot be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is he aware of the piracy ?
He says otherwise , but we say &apos; of course if &apos; .
The rumours about a link involving C@@ lar@@ ke were first taken up by the N@@ ot@@ t@@ ong C@@ ase office when a source , having a sexual attr@@ acti@@ veness to M@@ iss P@@ ow@@ by , said that she had been told : &apos; Let us not lose time with her , she is with Charles . &apos;
A g@@ ang , on which pir@@ ated voice messages were made on his phone at least three times , was seized at the house of Mul@@ c@@ aire in August 2006 .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ators have also found se@@ iz@@ ures on the computer of the private de@@ vice that concerned M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by and her con@@ scienti@@ ous s@@ ister in a “ Pro@@ ject ” dossier .
During the period when the de@@ vice investigated it , M@@ iss P@@ w@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls in which they were asked to information on her , added Mr Ed@@ is .
In the meantime , the former , N@@ ev@@ ille Th@@ ur@@ l@@ b@@ ec@@ k , and the former def@@ end@@ ant James We@@ a@@ er@@ up over@@ saw the monitoring of the L@@ ille P@@ ow@@ by &apos;s che@@ apest facts and gest@@ ures .
In a vote on 18 June 2005 , Mr C@@ ou@@ yet said : &apos; I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow , which I would really like to talk about in Charles . &apos;
Mr Ed@@ it said that the involvement of C@@ ou@@ l@@ son in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as the former Minister for Home Affairs David Bl@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury was heard on Thursday that C@@ ou@@ l@@ son faced Mr B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t with regard to a link with a married woman when he was a co-@@ defen@@ der of the co-@@ defend Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ ou@@ on and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny that they con@@ spi@@ red with others to pir@@ ate tele@@ phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Mul@@ c@@ aire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ b@@ ec@@ k and We@@ a@@ ther@@ p admitted that they had carried out telephone piracy .
Barack Obama ’ s Prime Minister
On Friday , 1 November 2013 , the US President had to receive Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , seeking help from the US to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities .
9@@ 64 people died in the violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN is doing even more with 9@@ 79 dead and 1 9@@ 02 injured .
This violence is increasingly mur@@ der@@ ous , despite increased security measures and extensive military operations launched for months by the government of N@@ our@@ i Al M@@ ali@@ ki , dominated by the Shia .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people were killed .
Ab@@ out two years after the withdrawal of US troops , the level of violence is causing fear of a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation while neighbouring Syria is in a civil war .
The bombs are h@@ itting markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ erals .
Men are slaughtered on the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s that he is politically margin@@ alized and the target of unjust arrests , has encouraged this outbreak of violence .
On Friday , further violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars in the north of Baghdad .
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( EI@@ I@@ L ) , a group aff@@ ili@@ ated to al-@@ Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , also involved in the civil war in Syria .
N@@ our@@ i Al M@@ ali@@ ki wants a &quot; global war &quot; against al-@@ Qaeda .
The violence is at the heart of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i Al M@@ ali@@ ki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the US President , elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country , gave an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington , N@@ our@@ i Al M@@ ali@@ ki has multi@@ plied meetings with the executive , and the elected representatives of Congress .
On Thursday , he argued for the international community to conduct a &quot; Third World War &quot; against al-@@ Qaeda .
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic Sen@@ ators .
But the latter also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a Shia , for giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his “ sec@@ tarian and authoritarian politics . ”
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki that “ Iran ’ s per@@ nic@@ ious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . ”
Beijing acc@@ uses an U@@ igh@@ ur group of the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men attack
The head of Chinese internal security accused a group of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur separati@@ sts on Friday of being behind the bomb attack that killed five people in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the Beijing Centre on Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V , has sh@@ ou@@ ted on the crow@@ d that was on the famous Chinese capital , a symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression that took place in 1989 , and took on its three passengers and two people .
M@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the political office responsible for internal security issues , accused the Islamic movement in Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan of being the instig@@ ator of this attack .
Many U@@ igh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ speaking minority in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese province East Tur@@ ke@@ stan .
For the Chinese Government , this movement is responsible for the frequent erup@@ tion of violence that is taking place there by demands for independence .
&apos;@@ The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organised and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &apos; , said M@@ g to the Mon@@ go@@ -@@ k@@ ong@@ e P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x TV channel .
&apos;@@ The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan &apos; , he added , his words were taken up by the new China agency .
The Chinese police identified the vehicle driver whose name suggests that he is of U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur origin and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained con@@ sign@@ ments of petrol and a flag with Or@@ thodox religious en@@ tries .
The incident caused 42 injured .
The Islamic movement in Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan is seen as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on contrac@@ eption , divorce and homosexu@@ ality
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has undertaken to conduct a major survey around the world about how the par@@ c@@ els manage sensitive issues such as contrac@@ eption , divorce , and sa@@ me-@@ sex couples .
The poll asks the participants how pri@@ ests care for gay couples and their children , and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by marriage links .
The poll was sent in mid-@@ October to every national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , with the signal of getting as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important gathering on the family which the Pope is planning next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Ca@@ thol@@ ics Re@@ port , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokes@@ person for the Conference of Catholic B@@ ish@@ ops in the United States confirmed that the document was auth@@ enti@@ c and that every b@@ is@@ ho@@ p would decide the right way to think about the par@@ o@@ si@@ ans .
In the UK , b@@ ish@@ ops published the Internet poll by asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .
DR@@ C
The in@@ trac@@ table of M@@ 23 , some hundreds of combat@@ ants , was s@@ atur@@ ated almost 2000 metres of al@@ titude on the farm h@@ ills of Chancellor , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bubbles , near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ om@@ a , two loc@@ alities located around 80 km to the north of G@@ om@@ a , the capital of North Ki@@ v@@ u province .
&apos;@@ It has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continues in spite of the night &apos; , told the A@@ F@@ P an inhabit@@ ant of J@@ om@@ a , joined by the telephone at 12.@@ 30 p.m. and according to whom a gir@@ l was injured in the morning .
&apos;@@ The intensity of clashes has fallen a little &apos; , he added , &apos; it seems that the DR@@ C &apos;s F@@ ARC For@@ ces have pushed the rebels back a bit &apos; .
According to this witnesses wishing to remain an@@ onymous , the soldiers had “ spent the night ” in J@@ om@@ b@@ a before moving to the front for an “ Oper@@ ation Oper@@ ation . ”
There was a great deal of talk behind him , which was fed up with small arms .
From B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the political fi@@ ef@@ dom@@ s , and the last place of the re@@ bel@@ lion that fell on Wednesday , a journalist of the A@@ F@@ P could hear heavy weapons de@@ ton@@ ations .
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the stabili@@ zation of the DR@@ C , the fighting went &apos; in a final phase &apos; , with the F@@ ARC &apos; en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ating the positions of the M@@ 23 resid@@ ue to de@@ part them &apos; .
Since the resumption , on Friday , of clashes between the Movement of 23 Mar@@ s ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , the Mon@@ us@@ co does not participate directly in the fighting , but it provides the government troops with decisive support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , dozens of soldiers , who are well supplied with am@@ muni@@ tion , were heading for the front line .

Ear@@ lier on , on the road to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , post border with Uganda , of the military ai@@ ded by civilians was carrying out a multi@@ fac@@ eted roc@@ ket launch on a new F@@ ARC tr@@ uck , which would have to take over the M@@ 23 positions on the h@@ ills .
The Congolese President , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , called on the rebels again on Wednesday evening to &apos; demo@@ bil@@ ise voluntarily &apos; or to be dis@@ armed &apos; by force &apos; , but has left the K@@ amp@@ ala Process open , where Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been discussing it since December without any results at present .
On the ground , the M@@ 23 political leaders are hoping to reach an agreement .
&apos;@@ We have finished the talks , only the Ug@@ and@@ an mediation to organise the signature &apos; , said Ro@@ ger Lu@@ um@@ b@@ a , Vice-President of the M@@ 23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
M@@ 23 was born of a ma@@ ster@@ y in April 2012 of former rebels , mostly tu@@ t@@ si , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ali and K@@ amp@@ ala refu@@ te .
North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ soil is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mineral resources .
In B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where there were around 5@@ ,000 people between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the return movement to the DR@@ C which started in the morning reversed in the middle of the day .
&apos;@@ This morning we went back to our fields , but the military told us to re@@ plic@@ ate &apos; , told the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ u@@ i , surrounded by its nine children , including a baby on the back .
It seems as if the sho@@ ts are getting closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of inhabitants crossed the border , some with a mat@@ ching match , to spend the night in Uganda .
The mu@@ si@@ cal Coun@@ ty
C@@ l@@ assi@@ fied , sophisticated , popular , in English or in French , the produc@@ ted and d@@ an@@ ced produc@@ tions take their flight .
After Bro@@ ad@@ ay and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It is a revolution : French mu@@ si@@ cal is affir@@ med as a kind of success .
In the L@@ ong D@@ ame of Paris from Paris to Mo@@ z@@ art the ro@@ ck oper@@ a , most of the attempts would be made in ridic@@ ule .
And success stories such as Cab@@ ar@@ et or the M@@ is@@ tices were a myster@@ y to the myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ lin in Ch@@ el@@ t@@ el@@ et and St@@ age - En@@ ter@@ t@@ as in Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or has changed the situation .
Today , both scenes are cop@@ ing with securities as a success story .
The first , this Christmas , takes up its excellent M@@ ary F@@ air Lad@@ y and announ@@ ces the global creation of &apos; an American in Paris &apos; .
In Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or , &apos; B@@ on and B@@ ast &apos; may well be one of the success stories of the season .
On the other scenes , mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les such as &apos; 17@@ 89 &apos; , &apos; the Bas@@ til@@ le am@@ bassadors &apos; and the small mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ res such as &apos; Pro@@ co &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are based on success and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , author of the reference book &apos; History of mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ res &apos; and conf@@ er on the Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ et Th@@ ec@@ k , analyses the reasons for the success that has been achieved so hard .
How do French mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ res develop ?
The supply has multi@@ plied .
First of all , there are the &apos; mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les &apos; which change at the mercy of producers ...
Some use them - beautiful images of images and a real story as in 17@@ 89 , the Basque A@@ man@@ ts .
Others are making a leap of 15 years on the pretext that we can serve almost - whatever you have to say - Po@@ k@@ or@@ a at the head of post@@ er .
After that we have the mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ tions with the s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ous produc@@ tions of Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ u which are bringing us back to the golden age of Bro@@ ad@@ ay and finding the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ he@@ im , the largest - living com@@ pos@@ er .
It is a popul@@ arly popul@@ ar@@ ary that popul@@ ates Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ des of variety by adapting them in French .
The independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough .
However , projects under way like &apos; R@@ t &apos; , &apos; The B@@ ai@@ er of Women ar@@ ai@@ ded &apos; or &apos; The Spring of the spring &apos; have difficulty being funded .
Do we have enough artists capable of being able to play and d@@ ance ?
In Paris , when there are eight music spectac@@ les in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , the cra@@ dle of the mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ve is very different .
Young people are trained in many schools .
There are many jobs between the regional theat@@ res , tourist , Bro@@ ad@@ ay , B@@ ro@@ ad@@ ay ...
The breeding ground is as high as the number of posts to be filled .
Why is the tourist in the province so successful ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor relative of culture in France .
Fe@@ w pieces of theat@@ re go on and it is often the case of a b@@ ou@@ le@@ ver for adults and not young adults .
There is a lack of mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les .
It is the same young people who like reality and what it produces as ep@@ hem@@ eral st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful young men ( often tal@@ ented ) at the top of a mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ le is an assurance that these young girls , and often their entire family , will become bo@@ gged down .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these spectac@@ les are sk@@ il@@ fully held by professionals who answer questions .
These spectac@@ les are very much expected when they arrive in a province of the province .
The Ma@@ y@@ on@@ na@@ ise has grown in Paris and disgu@@ ised by prov@@ in@@ cial prov@@ inci@@ als .

A serious injured in an accident with a shadow driver on Brussels Brussels
A road accident caused a serious w@@ ounded , on Friday morning at 5.@@ 30 p.m. , on the internal Brussels r@@ inging to the he@@ ight of H@@ o@@ il@@ a@@ art , to W@@ ater@@ lo@@ o .
The car of a driver has been caught by a shadow driver who is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
The movement was closed down to 9.@@ 00 a.m. in the case of the accident , the time that the road has been cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
However , this situation has not led to traffic j@@ ams , because the accident took place at the he@@ ight of the H@@ o@@ il@@ a@@ art exit .
It has therefore been possible to move away from the exit / entry .
A seriously injured child in Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris
A fi@@ ve-@@ year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on an attr@@ action at Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris .
Its vital prog@@ no@@ sis is no longer committed , but it is still hosp@@ it@@ alised .
At the time of the fall , the bo@@ y was with his father on a ship of the &apos; Pi@@ als of the Caribbean &apos; .
It has been closed up to new order .
The S@@ DR@@ s
Children are playing on a carbon bl@@ und@@ er that belong@@ ed to the rebels in M@@ 23 , in K@@ im@@ m@@ m@@ ba , on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DR@@ C .
On Friday , the Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the latest bas@@ tions of the M@@ 23 rebels near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana in the east of the DR@@ C .
The aim is to remove the M@@ 23 of the h@@ ills that over@@ shadow B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Yesterday , we took the h@@ ill in Bu@@ in@@ a , which over@@ shad@@ ows that of M@@ bubbles .
Today , M@@ bu@@ z@@ i should fall .

Chancellor of the Council . - ( FR ) S@@ Chancellor of the Chan@@ nel is not very strategic , and has indicated the A@@ F@@ P the Govern@@ or of North Ki@@ v@@ u , Ju@@ link P@@ lu@@ k@@ u .
Mr P@@ lu@@ k@@ u plans to go to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana on Saturday .
The country ’ s political leadership and the final place of the re@@ bel@@ lion are located on the Ug@@ and@@ an border , about 80 km to the north of G@@ om@@ a .
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Ar@@ med For@@ ces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday .
Since then , a few hundred ir@@ rig@@ ables of M@@ 23 have been s@@ atur@@ ated to almost 2@@ ,000 metres of al@@ titude on the farm h@@ ills of Chancellor Chan@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bubbles , near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and the neighbouring town of J@@ om@@ a .
In J@@ om@@ b@@ a , a person who reported that he was fighting all the time on Thursday throughout the day , said that the situation was &apos; calm since this morning &apos; .
According to him , a woman and her child were killed by the fighting on the eve and were buried .
A gir@@ l has been injured , and three other people have been injured , including an uprising , evac@@ uated by the F@@ ARC , added this witness quoted by the A@@ F@@ P .
Since the resumption of the fighting between the F@@ ARC and rebels on 25 October , the two war@@ ring parties have not given any assessment of the loss of life .
N@@ SA ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations increase the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance
By a beautiful day of late August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter over@@ flying the British Con@@ st@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , Germany ’ s financial capital .
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the German National intelligence agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the American out@@ post , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explain that the B@@ f@@ V was hoping to identify the presence of listening an@@ ten@@ tes and that the operation provoked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James C@@ l@@ assi@@ r , the US intelligence director , again insisted in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “ fly the industrial secre@@ ts of foreign companies on account of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ”
But , since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , who has become whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lowers , has begun to un@@ cover his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble trea@@ sure of information about the secre@@ ts of US surveillance , European governments and business leaders no longer know whether the director should be thinking .
Re@@ ports , according to which the US National Security Agency sp@@ y Brazilian oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in the C@@ oul@@ d , notably Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have more than ever ar@@ oused the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance .
The re@@ vel@@ ation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s tele@@ phones had been pir@@ ated , perhaps even for a decade , was the drop in the ocean that b@@ ore the ca@@ p .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then business leaders are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent .
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest .
“ Germany must wake up , ” dec@@ la@@ res O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ ü@@ n , President of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , representing German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the US is such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to a survey published in July by the board of advice .
However , in all the documents revealed by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there is no evidence to date that the United States has passed industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Business leaders are sceptical about this .
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only turn a blind eye and reopen them slowly ...
&apos;@@ This is not the right way to do &apos; , says H@@ ass@@ o Pl@@ at@@ ner , the chairman of the German company software company , SA@@ P .
If we want a strong European IT industry , then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , coal to cars and farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistic@@ ation of US es@@ pion@@ age agencies exposed by S@@ now@@ den ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations were a shock to some firms that thought that China was the biggest in terms of surveillance .
A major change is taking place in the cl@@ oud computer , as European officials have become aware that data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to an investigation carried out by the Cap@@ itals Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-@@ American members have abandoned their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cl@@ ou@@ ds following the re@@ vel@@ ations about the US program of data expl@@ oration .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &apos; Our customers are asking us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago : where my data are kept , and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction ?
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to fly their most precious secre@@ ts and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is not surprising that there is economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There have always been .
&apos;@@ This has been a recur@@ ring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion &apos; , says Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck , Director-General of the P@@ AS@@ F chemicals company .
The Americans are sp@@ ying on us in commercial and industrial terms just as we sp@@ y on them , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
Business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place , if that leaves the advantage of an ad@@ versary .
Bi@@ g companies have long been mar@@ ching the message that it is at least un@@ wise to rec@@ ou@@ p a free U@@ S@@ B key in a professional room or leave a mobile computer without supervision in a ho@@ tel room .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ack@@ enberg , a member of the Management Board of the Au@@ di car manufacturer , says that the collection of mobile phones before the Council meetings , so that they cannot be used as a distance listening equipment , has been common practice for years .
Germany ’ s B@@ f@@ V advis@@ es its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones paid when travelling abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies .
The mobile phones paid are then thrown out .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and supervision .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
‘ SMEs often lack experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access ’ , warn the B@@ f@@ V in a report .
The United States is al@@ er@@ ting their own companies to economic es@@ pion@@ age activities carried out by other countries .
The United States National Int@@ elli@@ gence ( N@@ I@@ E ) , carried out in February by the United States , mentioned France , as did Russia and Israel , guilty of having carried out economic intelligence acts , behind China , according to The Washington Po@@ st .
A member of a re@@ now@@ ned German company believed that , when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , “ the French are the worst . ”
Ber@@ n@@ ard Su@@ for@@ cin@@ i , a former French intelligence director , the D@@ C@@ R@@ I , said in an interview this month : “ The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , sp@@ y their allies . ”
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia who died in unusual circumstances
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia , whose body was found in a ru@@ ined car@@ pet in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se of his school , think that their son was murdered , declared the family lawyer on Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , from Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on 11 January caught up in a car@@ pet that was backed up behind the gy@@ m@@ na@@ w@@ s ’ gra@@ des of his school .
The S@@ her@@ i@@ ff ’ s investig@@ ative investig@@ ators concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son died in un@@ sol@@ ic@@ ited circumstances , but the family of the 1@@ 7-@@ year-old bo@@ y disputes these conclusions .
“ They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered , ” said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ m@@ p , the lawyer representing Ken@@ ne@@ th and J@@ ac@@ ol@@ y@@ n Joh@@ n@@ son , on Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
They never thought that he was dead as indicated in the S@@ her@@ i@@ ff Con@@ clu@@ sions .
“ They believe that this de@@ fies logic , physi@@ cs and common sense , ” added C@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered solely to cover the people responsible for the death of their son .
“ They sent their son to school with a car@@ te and they were handed to a mor@@ tal ba@@ g , ” he added .
The US Public Prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore said on Thursday that he had an official investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , pointing out that a number of important issues remained un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
He spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I shall follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My aim is to discover the truth .
‘ I consider that there is a sufficient basis ’ to open an official investigation , he said .
Mo@@ ore told journalists that the first au@@ top@@ sy indicated that Joh@@ n@@ son was dec@@ eived by “ posi@@ tional suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
However , a second authority has identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
‘ A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation ’ , he indicated .
Mo@@ ore added that if he un@@ covered elements of a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , he would ask the F@@ B@@ I to conduct it .
The representative of the S@@ her@@ i@@ ff of L@@ ow@@ oun@@ ds Coun@@ ty was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him on Thursday .
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video record@@ ings that the investig@@ ators had examined .
The parents of the teen@@ ag@@ er said that they hoped that video images would contain evidence of the circumstances of his death .
The CD@@ C publ@@ ishes advice on child aller@@ gies to schools
On Wednesday , the US Centre for Dis@@ ease Prevention and Control published a series of directives indicating how to deal with children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publ@@ ishes , since the number of children in school age with food aller@@ gies has so@@ ared .
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from a food all@@ ergy .
The CD@@ C found that the pre@@ valence of food aller@@ gies in the child rose by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the prof@@ ess@@ oral body and staff to child aller@@ gies and how to deal with them in the event of aller@@ gic reactions .
It also recommends that schools should have a h@@ all@@ mark stock – E@@ pi@@ p@@ en ’ s self-@@ injec@@ tor being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially leth@@ al an@@ ap@@ la@@ x@@ ia .
The legislative assemb@@ lies of the States have recently updated the regulations to enable schools to have more easily in stock .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children with an aller@@ gic reaction .
Children can say , &apos; I have the impression that something like the language &apos; , &apos; I have the impression of having a ha@@ ir on the language &apos; or &apos; I have pi@@ pes on language &apos; .
The N@@ SA case highlights the complete absence of a debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which is on a col@@ lis@@ ion basis in public when conven@@ ing the US ambassador on 21 October , and on the other banning the over@@ flying of the territory by Bolivia &apos;s presidential plane , on the basis of the rum@@ our of the presence on board Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de phone to Barack Obama , or when Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent Fab@@ i@@ us told the US ambassador , they respond to a real discovery , which is the extent of US surveillance of all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the Mon@@ de col@@ um@@ ns a few weeks away from the reproduction of the US diplomatic correspon@@ dence and , on the other hand , a condemnation of the ta@@ pping of the Qu@@ ai de Or@@ sa@@ y by the N@@ SA ?
Is it not a vague hypocrisy on your part ?
The journ@@ alistic approach is not a moral posi@@ tioning , but the search for interest and the relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks lift the ve@@ il over US diplomacy &apos;s analysis of political and other issues around the world , we consider that , in view of American power , this is an important light .
When we describe US inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is in no way to be indign@@ ant about this practice , it is to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the N@@ SA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The establishment of very powerful inter@@ c@@ eption technology in the last ten years by the US , but also by France , has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Moreover , in this area , France and the United States , among other things , have put in place cooperation procedures and almost daily exchange of information and are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal areas in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sha@@ h was reported to the French with the resources of the N@@ SA .
France can be led , for example , to pass whole blocks of data on the Sa@@ hel region to American services , and , as has already been said , the Americans can provide information to the French on other parts of the world .
So the underlying question behind this N@@ SA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have inter@@ c@@ eption tools , but the question of the complete absence of prior debate , particularly in the Parlia@@ ments , about the justification for such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be the@@ irs , and ultimately the issue of infringements of freedoms .
What is the real risk of the US ?
It is not clear how they can be punished .
The American risk may be two@@ fold .
The first is when their allies – and this was the case recently – learn that their leaders , sometimes at the top of their governments , have been monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have been stra@@ ined .
Another effect may be more economic : more and more European or South American companies are reluctant , in the light of the re@@ vel@@ ations , to entr@@ ust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws , and thus to the control of N@@ SA .
The final point is that the vast media re@@ vel@@ ations committed by media around the world , helping to start a debate on intelligence monitoring practices until then , could push legislators , including the US , to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services .
The Pa@@ rents of S@@ ex@@ ual Children
Germany became the first European nation to recognise a third sex for inf@@ ants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
The male or female sex of the new born will no longer be attributed to birth in a rigid way .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children , allowing them to include an &apos; indefin@@ ite &apos; or &apos; un@@ specified &apos; sex on its birth certificate .
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could take ha@@ sty decisions on a sur@@ ger@@ y of sexual re@@ as@@ sign@@ ment for their inf@@ ants , and to combat discrimination against people who are sex@@ ually motivated .
According to the B@@ BC , an inter@@ viewed person would have said years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work that doctors , con@@ tu@@ si@@ ties and bal@@ lo@@ ons have created .
It is estimated that a child on 2 000 born every year is neither a bo@@ y nor a daughter .
They are inter@@ viewed , the inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality that forms part of the six@@ ty of the six@@ ty diseases diagno@@ sed as a disorder of sexual development , a generic term design@@ ating people with ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es or inf@@ l@@ ants ( o@@ vine or female ) or ab@@ normally developed sexual organs .
Di@@ ana S@@ imp@@ son could have been sex@@ ually sex@@ u@@ alized .
S@@ ex@@ ual identification is still not fully understood , but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined it is better to use the best information available to at@@ tribute it , then to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a sur@@ gical act , if necessary .
D@@ r@@ . J@@ ack D@@ res@@ her , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and expert on sexual identification , said that the new German law “ appears to be a good idea . ”
S@@ ex@@ ual children pose an ethical dilemma .
‘ Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a sur@@ gical act , but that is not the case with most children ’ , he added .
S@@ ex@@ ual as@@ sign@@ ment can be made without operation , and we can see how identity develops .
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise .
No one can answer the question as to why this is happening .
It is like the myster@@ y surrounding homosexual people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the people who are inter@@ viewed as different from trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender persons , since their status is not linked to gender , but rather to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively that of a man or just that of a woman , but generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other .
These characteristics can be manife@@ sted themselves in secondary sexual characteristics ( such as mus@@ cul@@ ar mass , p@@ ilo@@ ting , pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um , and stat@@ ure ) , primary sexual characteristics ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es and hormones .
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by sexual and gender people in employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudices .
Non-@@ compli@@ ant young boys now have camps that are specifically intended for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male , female or “ third sex ” sex on their official documents .
In June , an Austr@@ ali@@ an Austr@@ ali@@ an , Nor@@ ri@@ e May@@ -@@ W@@ el@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been recognised “ neutral ” after winning his appeal trial that allows him to keep a “ un@@ specified ” sex for life .
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are always controversial , according to a broadcast broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of legislators in this deeply Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .
The American Ca@@ th@@ oli@@ c On@@ line site also opposed German law , writ@@ ing that “ since the world is dra@@ gged into a new rule in which gender is a choice , but where sexual activity is not one , two other pillars of civilisation are over@@ turned . ”
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of a baby also said on B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to be awarded to babies at their birth .
&apos;@@ The role of parent is sufficiently stres@@ s@@ ful without further restrictions , particularly if you do not know the sex of your child &apos; , she said on the website for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sexual organs were called her@@ um@@ ph@@ ro@@ o@@ ke , according to the name of the beautiful Greek God who had a dual sex .
And , just over ten years ago , the medical community regarded gender as an ar@@ row , which can be er@@ ased and which can be re@@ drawn .
But now many people are calling into question the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be mistaken , knowing how a child will feel his sexual resignation when they grow up .
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , this was a psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency , ” he said .
When these children were born , they were not called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , they were telephone .
The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Mon@@ ey , the Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins University , who considered the gender to be m@@ alle@@ able .
He enshrined the term “ sexual identity ” and argued that social and environmental signals – how parents raise a child – inter@@ act with a child ’ s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female .
But in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as John / Jo@@ an , his the@@ ories gave rise to controversy .
He advised the parents of a small bo@@ y whose pen@@ ny had been cut off during a con@@ spic@@ uous circum@@ c@@ ision to keep him entirely under the car@@ pet , by also taking away the str@@ ang@@ les , and bringing him up as a daughter .
“ Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transition , but it was not the case , ” said D@@ res@@ her .
At the age of 15 , he became a bo@@ y and married with a woman .
But he committed suicide at 38 years .
D@@ res@@ her said that some doctors “ always repeat this model . ”
But in the 1990s , with the Internet coming , those who survived these sex changes say &apos; &#91; that &#93; they are not satisfied with the result &apos; .
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 36 year-old writ@@ er in Mon@@ tan@@ a , born with male ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es , but ambiguous sexual organs .
Do@@ c@@ tors could not really say whether he had a broad cli@@ que or a little pen@@ ny and convinced that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
So shortly after its birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered a sur@@ ger@@ y of the external body and of the str@@ ang@@ les and was high as a daughter .
They were given female hormones at the age of 12 .
“ I knew I was not a daughter , ” he said about A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 years he has suffered a v@@ ag@@ or@@ op@@ y .
But de@@ pressed and realised that something was wrong , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horri@@ fied .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth – and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a disorder of sexual development ( D@@ D@@ S ) that prevented its body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one so that its sexual organs could develop .
Having learned the truth , he has once again become a man , according to the treatment of his te@@ to@@ ster@@ one , and he has taken away the s@@ ins .
The sur@@ ger@@ y made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he is defending the cause of others in an organisation called Inter@@ face Pro@@ ject , which is trying to standardis@@ e the percep@@ tions of people who are sex@@ ually motivated .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ attr@@ s , the General Executive Director of the non-@@ profit organization based in California Ad@@ voc@@ ate for In@@ formed C@@ ho@@ ice , fears that German law “ inv@@ ites labelling and stig@@ ma@@ tisation . ”
“ Many activists worry that German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and give their child an “ indefin@@ ite sex ” , she said .
We fear that it will encourage interventions .
We think it would be better to give a male or female sex and wait .
But we did not see what the law would give , so we can only move forward with assumptions .
Tam@@ ard@@ s-@@ M@@ attracting said that his organisation supported Austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to choose to be recognised as the third sex . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type , ” she added .
German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth .
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age .
When they grow , they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr Ar@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , a radi@@ olog@@ ist speci@@ alized in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ burgh ma@@ m@@ mo@@ graphy , whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group , has said that the German law will “ take responsibility ” for parents and children .
The daughter of Dr Bar@@ at@@ z , K@@ are@@ t , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es , but suffers from a D@@ D@@ S known as complete in@@ sensitivity to an@@ od@@ ro@@ gen@@ s .
As a result of the failure of its anc@@ ill@@ ary rec@@ ep@@ tors , K@@ diplomacy has developed female characteristics .
It has a v@@ ag@@ in , but no u@@ pro@@ ar or o@@ ven .
Today , the age of 29 , K@@ are@@ t is married and internal psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at the University of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
Although it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or mothers .
“ The law gives parents a certain la@@ titude so that they do not have to take ha@@ sty decisions , ” said Bar@@ at@@ z .
This gives them time to carry out some tests and to understand them , and a deadline before they include a male or female ‘ female ’ .
So everything goes well – you can raise your child and love it .
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being relative .
You do not have to rush into sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
“ This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they are afraid not to do what they need , ” she said .
Finally , the child will decide with which sex he feels the / most comfortable – and that is wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for itself .
In the long@@ ev@@ ity of his government
The Italian Council President En@@ ri@@ co Le@@ t@@ ta believes that his government will keep up until 2015 , despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to stri@@ p Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi of his mandate .
In a daily interview with La Sta@@ mp@@ a , the cen@@ ter-@@ left leader says that he firmly intends to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015 .
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi is threatening to withdraw his support for government if the Senate , where he has more ad@@ vers@@ aries than supporters , makes his de@@ portation .
But part of his camp , grou@@ ped around the National Secretary of the People ’ s Freedom Party ( P@@ D@@ L ) Ang@@ el@@ ino Al@@ f@@ ano , continues to support the government , as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi ’ s in@@ junc@@ tions , which already wanted to push the cabinet down .
The L@@ .@@ A@@ . Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Security Agency , T@@ SA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire .
There have been fi@@ re-@@ fighters who have said that they have responded to a call for &apos; multiple w@@ ounded &apos; .
&apos;@@ The forces of law are on the spot &apos; , precise the airport on its T@@ wit@@ ter account , while television pictures showed people evac@@ uated in am@@ bul@@ ances .
&apos;@@ There was a sho@@ oting &apos; , told the A@@ F@@ P a spokes@@ person for the US transport safety agency ( T@@ SA ) .
A@@ BC &apos;s local an@@ ten@@ na showed a person evac@@ uated on a k@@ n@@ uc@@ k@@ ard , and a second transported on a whe@@ el@@ chair .
The incident took place at 9.@@ 30 p.m. ( 12.@@ 30 p.m. in Mon@@ tre@@ al ) at the ter@@ minal 3 of the airport , also specified the airport .
The L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Times says that t@@ em@@ ach@@ s 2 and 3 are being evac@@ uated .
The T@@ SA spokes@@ person was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured .
All flights to and leaving the airport have been suspended .
The Israeli army k@@ ills a Hamas member to Gaz@@ a
Israeli tanks killed an Islamist Hamas milit@@ ant in Hamas on Thursday and injured another in the south of Gaza , learned from sources of health services .
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting has broken out in this region , because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and have been targeted by Palestinian bro@@ kers .
The Israeli army has only referred to a &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a &apos; terrorist &apos; tunnel by the He@@ bre@@ w State , wi@@ dened at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-@@ October .
Report : Obama campaign
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advis@@ ors considered , in the utmost secrecy , to replace Vice-President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en by H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most striking event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign of Mar@@ k Hal@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ n , “ D@@ ow@@ n D@@ ow@@ n : G@@ ame Cha@@ range 2012 ” .
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday evening that the President ’ s relatives had conducted “ in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see whether B@@ id@@ en ’ s ev@@ ic@@ tion could help Obama to re-@@ election , while his hopes fell .
According to the political correspon@@ dent of the Times J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior leaders of the campaign and of the White House , namely the former Secretary-General of the White House , Bill Sal@@ e@@ y , to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fier@@ cely guar@@ ded in the Chic@@ ago B@@ ase of Cam@@ go and within the eg@@ g Bureau .
Only half a dozen close advis@@ ors of the president – including D@@ e@@ al@@ y , Obama ’ s former leader , J@@ im M@@ ess@@ ina , and former advisers in the White House David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e – knew that change was under way .
“ D@@ on D@@ ow@@ n ” indicates that D@@ e@@ ey has led the burden to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their “ close personal ties , ” before finally deciding on change when the figures have shown that having Clinton on the presidential list “ did not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances of success . ”
In an interview with Martin , D@@ e@@ ey confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
“ I said that I had looked at a whole range of questions , and that was one of them , ” said D@@ e@@ ep in the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that at that time the President was not in the form , and so it was said , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos;
While D@@ é@@ al@@ y called the “ concer@@ t ” examination , Martin said to Ander@@ son Co@@ op@@ er of C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested a great deal to discover whether the change would be beneficial in the election .
“ The countryside does not devote a lot of money to polls and to discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action , ” said Martin on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
However , we do not know whether Obama knew that his team was looking at replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N that he asked D@@ al@@ e@@ y if his bos@@ s were aware of the possible overhaul .
Although D@@ é@@ al@@ y said that he did not think that the president was aware of any change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was “ possible ” that Obama knew .
Martin added that “ D@@ ou@@ ble D@@ ow@@ n ” was not a definitive answer to the question as to whether political polls had reached Obama ’ s office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know that B@@ id@@ en ’ s ev@@ ic@@ tion of the presidential list was considered .
‘ Perhaps ’ , answered Martin .
Do you want a flu@@ o ice ?
A British entreprene@@ ur has created the first flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent gl@@ ory in the world based on contempt .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has benefited from the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent properties of this marine animal to develop a lu@@ ci@@ d col@@ lis@@ ion .
He had the idea after having read a study on the me@@ als and convinced Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate the sh@@ ining protein ch@@ est@@ nu@@ t .
The ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with language by increasing the p@@ H of the protein to make it brilliant .
Ch@@ ris explains that , since the ice cre@@ am begins to read when it re@@ acts to the heat of the m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece , the more you stand , the more brilliant it becomes .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the ice society ‘ Li@@ ick M@@ e I@@ m ’ De@@ li@@ ci@@ u , said : ‘ It is an un@@ believ@@ able thing , but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of that s@@ ong costs around £ 200 . ’
The protein we use in ice re@@ acts with the neutral p@@ H language .
So when your m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece he@@ ars the protein , the level of p@@ H increases , and the ice is sh@@ ining .
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en , because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
This is probably the most expensive ice that I have created , because the light of the bad weather is four times more expensive than gold .
Every single shop therefore costs me about £ 140 .
But it is rather good !
society with the experimental leadership of Char@@ lie , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual ice per@@ fu@@ me such as beer , che@@ ese , beef and the gold lea@@ f .
But its next creation will be even more ambitious .
He added : “ I really want to develop an in@@ visible ice . ”
This is intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the f@@ us@@ s caused by the ice cr@@ ist@@ ers that are the ice cre@@ am , but I think I will find a way to do that .
The ice uses the flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent properties of the me@@ tal@@ es@@ hi@@ p of Chinese scientists .
L@@ ou R@@ ed
The s@@ ong@@ er L@@ ou R@@ ed died when he had exercises in ta@@ i chi , revealed on Thursday the wife of L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son in a letter published by the regional newspaper &apos; E@@ ast@@ er Ham@@ p@@ ton Sta@@ r &apos; and intended for the inhabitants of the city of S@@ pre@@ s , where the couple had a house .
The arti@@ st died last Sunday , at the age of 71 .
&apos;@@ He died on Sunday morning , when he looked at the trees and made the famous 21st movement of ta@@ i chi , with the hands of mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an who f@@ iled the air &apos; , wrote La@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son .
L@@ ou R@@ ed was a master of the Chinese mar@@ tial .
The sing@@ er &apos;s wife also explains that she promised her hus@@ band , the week before her death , that she would get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in S@@ pr@@ ings ( L@@ ong Is@@ land ) .
L@@ ou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years .
Even if we are c@@ it@@ d@@ ins , it is our spiritual home .
&apos;@@ L@@ ou was a pr@@ ince and a figh@@ ter , and I know that his s@@ ong@@ s on the pain and beau@@ ty of the world will pass on to many people the great joy of living that he had &apos; , adding .
L@@ ou R@@ ed suffered a li@@ ver trans@@ plant last May .
H@@ all@@ we@@ in 2013 :
When I was small , H@@ all@@ we@@ en was magic .
My s@@ ister and I were allowed to eat swee@@ ts , to go down late and to disgu@@ ise us to go to the neighbourhood .
Today I have become more pe@@ tty .
Over the last two years , I have not distributed a single bon@@ good and I will certainly not do so this year .
But the st@@ ars show that I am the black sheep when we talk about H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
The majority of Americans – 15@@ 8 million in fact – will be celebrating H@@ all@@ op@@ we@@ u this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 trillion on bon@@ good , disgu@@ ise , and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to National R@@ et@@ ter@@ ation Federation .
What I look forward to on every party in H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en is the trends .
G@@ ran@@ ts should be $ 1.2 trillion over the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent under the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , un@@ anim@@ ated objects are f@@ altering .
Women no longer need to be professional professionals ; they can also be s@@ ex@@ ed food like p@@ iz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As far as men are concerned , I expect to see many z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , thanks to the television series The Wal@@ king De@@ ad , and I be@@ t that the men of the D@@ a@@ ft P@@ un@@ k space will be among our photo@@ s In@@ stag@@ gra@@ m this year .
According to Google , the most sought disgu@@ ises are z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates , and wit@@ ches .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my surprise , they were not the only ones .
In fact , the Americans are going to spend 3@@ 30 M in disgu@@ ise for animals this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
There are many curious dogs disgu@@ ised as ho@@ o@@ dog@@ s .
When it comes to swee@@ ts , we do not sli@@ p .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 trillion on bon@@ good this year , according to the Ni@@ el@@ sen cabinet .
This represents about 27@@ 2 million k@@ g of b@@ ars Her@@ sh@@ ey , sugar , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ l@@ ers and bar@@ res C@@ lar@@ k .
It is a super-@@ news for the 41 million children who go to the hunting of swee@@ ts in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Trade .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not be told , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate in H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
Good maize is the only thing we do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million k@@ g are sold for H@@ all@@ we@@ en , according to the National Con@@ f@@ lic@@ on@@ ers Association .
That is about 9 billion maize grain .
It is a myster@@ y that I have not yet managed to clarify .
Nothing is more representative of H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en than H@@ an@@ ed houses .
They carry the best names , such as “ Ter@@ r Be@@ h@@ in@@ d the Wel@@ s ” ( who is actually a real prison ) , “ H@@ ow@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ S@@ c@@ ren@@ am , ” and “ The Ho@@ ly of Sha@@ ck . ”
In fact , there are 1 200 officially recognised houses in the United States , which generate about $ 500 per revenue , according to America ’ s High Representative , and this includes these form@@ idable photo@@ graph@@ s of you p@@ iling you over that your friends are putting on Fac@@ e@@ book , and that you cannot abduc@@ t and on which a kind you like leaves a comment of the “ lo@@ vely head . ”
Finally , we are talking about c@@ it@@ ro@@ ls .
Char@@ lie Brown presented us with G@@ ro@@ se Ci@@ f@@ ill@@ es when you were g@@ ros@@ sly g@@ ag@@ ged , and s@@ cul@@ p@@ sed a c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine in the form of land , and it is like dec@@ e@@ it a Christmas tre@@ e – that is something we have been doing ever since .
Th@@ an@@ k@@ fully for us , the “ b@@ baby of the b@@ ust ” trend began only last year thanks to P@@ inter@@ is , so most of us s@@ cul@@ ed these po@@ les and did not have to sit down .
This year , Americans will spend around $ 10@@ 6 M in c@@ it@@ r@@ us , according to S@@ .@@ S@@ . C@@ en@@ sus Bureau .
The sh@@ ell@@ fish , which are slowly d@@ row@@ ning on the por@@ k of your house , probably came from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 5@@ 42 million gra@@ des were grown this year .
If you seek to point out to you more , call Ti@@ m and S@@ us@@ an Ma@@ is@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , California , and try to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ate their c@@ at of 9@@ 22 k@@ g .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland will create a “ bad bank ” ( “ bad bank ” ) structure , bringing together $ 38 billion ( € 45 billion ) of the most risky assets , designed to rela@@ x its relations with London and accelerate its re@@ privatization .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet in the next two years by 55 % to 70 % , and hopes to complete it completely within three years .
R@@ B@@ S also said that it would include a vision to depreci@@ ate additional dubious claims from four to 4@@ .5 billion p@@ ounds in the quarter , a writ@@ e-@@ related writ@@ er .
R@@ B@@ S also said that this internal restructuring would release $ 10@@ -@@ 11 billion of capital , thereby strengthening its ability to lend .
The bank and London have stressed that the &apos; bad bank &apos; would be able to draw a line in the past , with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of R@@ B@@ S .
&apos;@@ We can now move forward , concern ourselves with the future and 90 % of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom &apos; , said the new Director-General Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan to the press .
L@@ and R@@ over
There is an in@@ ner state seats and h@@ orm@@ one bel@@ ts at 6 points and an Inter@@ co@@ m system .
One of the options is improved bra@@ kes , a service giving access to the Bow@@ ler Wor@@ ks mechan@@ ics , logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events .
D@@ re@@ w Bow@@ ler , the Director-General of Bow@@ ler M@@ ot@@ or@@ har@@ port , said : &apos; The s@@ ali@@ ent am@@ ate@@ urs who join Bow@@ ler have changed . &apos;
They are not all experienced , some seek exc@@ itement and ad@@ venture and realistic access to international events .
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with L@@ and R@@ over and the M@@ SA , and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to try different forms of rac@@ ke@@ ys in the United Kingdom and international , and to prepare for the ri@@ gg@@ ers and realities of ra@@ ids .
We had a great deal of pleasure in developing the vehicle of the D@@ ef@@ der Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge – the cham@@ pion@@ ship is really going to be pal@@ p@@ able .
In addition , D@@ ef@@ der Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deser@@ ts of North Africa and the Middle East .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade was called to rescue a lost chi@@ p after being stuck to 15 m above the ground on an unstable cor@@ n@@ ic in a career .
R@@ by , a co@@ ol e@@ po@@ l , had escap@@ ed after an un@@ fe@@ t@@ tered road accident
It was picked up three days later by a person wal@@ king his dog stuck in the career .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade took a back seat in order to recover the chi@@ p and save it from a certain death
A chi@@ p had the chance to escape the worst after the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was called to recover it safely when it was lost at 15 m above the ground on the unstable season of a c@@ lif@@ f .
R@@ by , a 14@@ -@@ month co@@ ol wrec@@ k , escap@@ ed after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday .
His owners , Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years , and his small friend Bec@@ ky H@@ all , 20 years , went to the career of F@@ l@@ as@@ rest in D@@ en@@ gen@@ me , in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to return to Ru@@ by and than@@ ked W@@ est Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
They had desperately sought their lost chic@@ ken and launched an appeal on social net@@ working sites after it disappeared into the career as a result of an un@@ fe@@ t@@ tered accident .
T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ .@@ 15 on Wednesday , a care@@ ta@@ ker person who promised his dog re@@ pen@@ ted R@@ by on a cor@@ n@@ uc@@ he in the career , stuck to 15 m above the ground .
A technical rescue team from the C@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fire bri@@ g@@ ade took place in the places and came back to a reminder to save Ru@@ by by using a civic ci@@ an to transport it to the top of the c@@ lif@@ f .
The technical aid expert An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton said : “ It was in a precarious situation . ”
She was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , 15 m of the summit and 15 .
It did not move at all during the rescue – it was frozen .
But it is right now .
She e@@ aten b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
This was a very unusual appeal .
It is incredible that someone has noticed the dog .
The technical rescue expert Peter L@@ au said : “ R@@ by has had a great chance of getting out of it . ”
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
R@@ by was led by the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for control ; its general state was satisfactory , apart from exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
M@@ iss H@@ all , H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ I was terri@@ fied by observing the rescue . ”
I did not think it was there first .
It was surprising to have him in arms again .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian said that if it had been too exhausted and had ev@@ apor@@ ated , it would probably have fallen .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade has been po@@ ign@@ ant .
What they did was really courageous .
They are so grateful , each has been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ ei@@ gh@@ ley , added : &apos; It was feared that she would fall , but she did not move . &apos;
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade was sup@@ pressed .
I cannot believe that she was there .
M@@ ick J@@ ag@@ ger says that he never dre@@ am@@ ed K@@ at@@ y Per@@ ry when she was 18 years old .
During an interview on Austr@@ ali@@ an radio broad@@ casts this week , the po@@ p star said that she was cha@@ or@@ ist on J@@ ag@@ ger ’ s s@@ ong , “ O@@ ld H@@ abi@@ ts D@@ e H@@ ard ” in 2004 .
Per@@ ry said that he had din@@ ner with the ro@@ ck of ro@@ ck and explained , “ he dra@@ ined me when I was 18 . ”
She added , “ It was a long time ago , and he was very kind . ”
In a statement on Thursday , a representative of J@@ ag@@ ger , 70 years ago , said that he &apos; categorically den@@ ies having made advances in K@@ at@@ y Per@@ ry &apos; .
The representative added : &apos; Perhaps she conf@@ uses it with someone else . &apos;

Beijing ’ s D@@ ang@@ erous Islamic Movement
“ behind the scenes to the attack was the Islamic Movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan , based in Central and Western Asia , ” declared the pat@@ ron of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television channel , according to a video online online on a website on a website .
M@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the Chinese Communist Party ( CC@@ P ) , spoke in T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent on an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a special organisation after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three U@@ igh@@ urs of the same family of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , the border of several Central Asian countries , have preci@@ pit@@ ated their car with g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine sh@@ ell@@ s against the entry of the banned City into Beijing , in a suicide attack that killed two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and his mother died in the car fire .
The E@@ ti@@ m , which dec@@ la@@ res itself to fight for the independence of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan , a former name of China ’ s X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , was classified by the UN in 2002 as the aff@@ ili@@ ated Al@@ -@@ Qaeda organisations .
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic disorder in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George K@@ e@@ ev@@ an : Europe ’ s break@@ -up gives the S@@ co@@ ts
Another worrying story of independence .
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to be able to join the EU .
Now we hear stories of passport control in Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wi@@ re border along the H@@ ad@@ nothing wall .
While it is true that the newspaper newspaper in Stra@@ us@@ cl@@ y@@ de has indicated the possible economic fall@@ out from greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it was not in the headlines ( and it was to be expected ) .
No one has said that the EU Member States spend much of their time circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from S@@ co@@ ts .
So it is a story that is not one .
And a story so old that it is now fixed : I heard for the first time the b@@ ob@@ b@@ ard that &apos; independence means passport control &apos; more than 40 years ago .
However , an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old d@@ ust .
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe &apos;s instructions , in fact ?
Why exchange the y@@ o@@ ke of London against that of Brussels , especially now ?
This is the real news about Europe : the great post-war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is permanently at a standstill .
With the euro crisis , the European Pro@@ ject is officially dead .
Ac@@ ross Europe , parties that oppose the EU or are campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Al@@ ter@@ native Party for Germany , founded only this year and arrived at nowhere , brought together almost five million votes in September ’ s federal elections and lifted the Liberal Democratic Party ( equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the B@@ unde@@ sta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket on national economies through joining the single currency , has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece .
Instead , the European system has put its members of the exchange rate in favour of German exporters – something that German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency , the southern European countries find themselves with an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem with Germany .
The only recourse is to make cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper mal@@ a@@ ise linked to productivity in Europe .
Following the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidi@@ zing French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States .
This is a down@@ right draw@@ back in terms of costs , as we have already seen in Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ outh .
Not all wage wages in the world will prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being penalised by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the revol@@ t revol@@ t , particularly in France , is one of the great EU leaders .
After the war , the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy un@@ w@@ ashed .
As a result , Mar@@ ine Le Pen ’ s far-@@ right right-wing party , the anti-@@ European National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , sending the Socialists to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing split will automatically promote the left .
What is Mari@@ ine Le Pen doing with her new popularity with the French white class ?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single , anti-@@ European bloc in the European Parliament .
If anti-@@ European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , the anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will return to something that will resemb@@ le the “ Europe of the United Nations ( sovereign ) ” privileged by General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency .
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project , and I hope that it will give the United States a soft eyes .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could live with a fre@@ er European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe .
Otherwise , we should im@@ it@@ ate Norway and retain our economic independence .
Scotland ’ s S@@ N@@ P government is – and this is worth noting – the anti-@@ austerity political movement that has been most successful in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed cuts ( and implemented ) by the Labour Chancellor , Al@@ lis@@ ta@@ r Dar@@ ling , and the subsequent conservative / Liberal Democrats .
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
E@@ arly E@@ mer@@ ging :
Stu@@ dies show that Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than white girls .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ cal changes do not mean that the pub@@ er@@ ty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early pub@@ er@@ ty .
The trend towards an early pub@@ er@@ ty
The former correspon@@ dent of C@@ N@@ N P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a specialist journalist in family and child health issues .
Should a mother worry if her daughter ’ s s@@ ins and po@@ ols are beginning to grow to 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ics that took place this week in Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Dr Paul K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine , explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard .
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general , this does not indicate a rapid move towards full pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
The obvious signs of development , such as the bour@@ geo@@ isation of the se@@ in@@ ers , the po@@ les under arms and the pu@@ b@@ ic area and bo@@ di@@ ly o@@ ders , appear in girls earlier .
But there has been only a slight advance of the age of the first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , when it was 12 years in 1970 .
“ Once the ch@@ or@@ us began to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear , ” indicated K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of “ E@@ ary P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ ls : The Es@@ ren@@ al Gu@@ ide to C@@ om with T@@ is Comm@@ on Pro@@ ta@@ m . ”
Time is the most accurate test of how the pu@@ ber@@ y will develop .
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of the pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is considered to be &apos; early &apos; when the development of the pe@@ t@@ ch is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows or stops – something that a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can follow closely .
A faster development can justify tests carried out by an en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine to remove serious problems like tu@@ m@@ ors or k@@ y@@ sts .
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : premature ageing of those which can curb growth and a small size of ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
The recommendations on medicinal and hormon@@ al treatment are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .
The psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z is cautious with medicines , but recognises that “ control of pub@@ er@@ ty can mitigate some of the problems of behaviour and sen@@ sa@@ tional treatment of girls from different others . ”
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
“ They fear the risk of pregnancy , or even how they are going to deal with hygiene issues , ” said K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
“ It was a shock , ” re@@ minis@@ cent of a woman whose daughter had its first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
It came from the frigh@@ tened and shocked school to be the first among its friends .
There are many the@@ ories made to public knowledge about the causes of the early childcare .
Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages from the media are responsible .
The boys , such as girls , reach their homes sooner .
K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z says that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He took part in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9 , which links the percentage of fat with the outbreak of pub@@ ber@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
At a global level , the mechanisms of the early pub@@ er@@ ty seem to be influenced by everything , economic conditions for the climate , via genes .
Another problem is that , while boys have po@@ les on their faces and in the younger pu@@ ri@@ an area , the trend towards a real early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced as among girls .
Other doctors at the A@@ PA conference have stressed the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ac@@ id and the p@@ ile is common , even in inf@@ ants and small ones .
“ We have to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of the pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said Dr L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a child en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine working in the hospital for children Gor@@ y@@ e@@ b in Mor@@ ris@@ to@@ own in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents should not hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ s to know how to speak with their children .
“ This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than expected , ” explained K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
If you remain calm , your child will react well in general .
d@@ augh@@ ters whose pu@@ ber@@ y is early must be reassured that , even when it happens earlier than expected , the process is part of life .
The C@@ ase of Be@@ as
&apos; In@@ si@@ de L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is &apos; of the Co@@ en bro@@ thers , the Gr@@ and P@@ rice of the last F@@ ann@@ es F@@ es@@ ti@@ val , is a no@@ stal@@ gic and fun@@ ny film on the Green@@ w@@ ich village of 196@@ 1 and the mad music that was just starting to raise it before Bo@@ b D@@ y@@ l@@ an arrived .
Jo@@ el and E@@ th@@ an Co@@ en , whose fil@@ mo@@ graphy has just been subject to a retro@@ spec@@ tive to the French five , had brought the golden Pal@@ en to C@@ ann@@ es in 1991 for Bar@@ ton Fin@@ k .
If D@@ y@@ l@@ an or the Tri@@ o Peter , Paul and M@@ ary , Jo@@ el and E@@ th@@ an Co@@ en were not to be hi@@ red on the rising st@@ ars of the American film , O@@ sc@@ ar I@@ sa@@ a@@ c , 33 years , but also on the world star po@@ p Ju@@ sti@@ n Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke .
In his hum@@ orous film of hum@@ our in which music is a central figure and interpre@@ ted s@@ ong@@ s , O@@ sc@@ ar I@@ sa@@ a@@ c has shown a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an and a s@@ ong accomplished , while Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke , his friend in the film , leaves the po@@ p for mad music with cont@@ ag@@ ious cont@@ ag@@ ion .
As for Car@@ ey Mul@@ li@@ g@@ an , she left the rich A@@ is@@ ry Mul@@ li@@ li@@ an in “ G@@ at@@ s@@ by the wonderful ” for less rela@@ xed clo@@ thes , a soft voice when she s@@ ank , but the s@@ cri@@ pt of the mo@@ on when she speaks .
The &apos; In@@ si@@ de L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is &apos; tells a week about the tri@@ bes of a mad sing@@ er who is not going to lose and f@@ lies with the whole world .
It accepts the re@@ plac@@ ements at the foot of the stu@@ di@@ os .
Without housing , he is turning the can@@ e of his friends who still want to receive it .
docu@@ mentary air
&apos;@@ His relationship with success is tortured ; that is what we are interested in : a mix@@ ture of bad luck , a gar@@ den which is not here at the right time , which is not a careers but which integr@@ ates , with self-@@ destructive behaviour &apos; , told the press E@@ th@@ an Co@@ en , crow@@ ned with his bro@@ ther Jo@@ el of several O@@ sc@@ ars and C@@ ann@@ es .
If L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is did not exist , the two f@@ ans of mad music built their history on real person@@ alities at the time such as the mad D@@ a@@ ve V@@ on R@@ on@@ k .
The idea was to show the moment before Green@@ w@@ ich &apos;s rise , that New York neigh@@ bor@@ hood called to become &quot; the ep@@ ic@@ entre of the rise of mad music , which would generate international st@@ ars &quot; as the journalist E@@ li@@ j@@ h Wal@@ d , a friend of Van R@@ on@@ k , wrote .
The film then takes docu@@ mentary bat@@ ches , the du@@ sty music label inv@@ aded 3@@ 3@@ T invented ha@@ be@@ z by an old , un@@ pay@@ able secre@@ tary , the mu@@ si@@ cal choices of the day , and the c@@ af@@ és where the sing@@ ers came .
The Co@@ operative bro@@ thers are still working with a strange character of character who is going through the film permanently : a magnificent round in the cr@@ ack of L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is .
As@@ ked on the way he made his character , the actor and sing@@ er Ju@@ ti@@ n Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke recalled that he had &apos; grown up in the T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ se@@ e , ba@@ ked by the b@@ lights and the col@@ ours &apos; .
&apos;@@ My first music lessons were given to me by my grand@@ father who taught me to play the gu@@ ise &apos; , he said .
For Ju@@ st@@ n Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke , if work is needed for &apos; being considered good &apos; , &apos; chance may also start someone &apos;s career &apos; , and &apos; more and more today &apos; .
Like L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is , who refuses to compromise on his music , the po@@ p is saying that in a career , &apos; the most important thing is not to allow ourselves to be stuck with everything that can prevent us from speaking &apos; .

There is a qu@@ arre@@ l about the wid@@ th of seats when large orders are at stake .
The dispute is ra@@ ging between the major aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical manufacturers about the wid@@ th of the seats of the tourist class on long-@@ distance flights , pa@@ ving the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ x , which is taking place in the month .
The conflict is about the wid@@ th of seats on long-@@ distance flights to economic class passengers – which are not always the most crow@@ ded by airlines , but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week , Airbus called on the aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 h@@ ens ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Bo@@ eing says that it should be up to airlines to decide .
The dispute has erup@@ ted when the avi@@ on@@ ers seek to sell even larger versions of their long-@@ run long-@@ run aircraft , hoping that they may have a record record in the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November .
The way in which seats are ready to go back – in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats head on – is essential for the economic performance of the “ mini-@@ ju@@ m@@ m@@ o ” seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says that its “ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X ” re@@ designed will be able to accommodate 40@@ 6 people in seats of more than 17 h@@ ens , and will be confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 per row seats .
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A@@ 350 will transport 350 people in the seats of 18 h@@ ens of large entr@@ ants in line with 9 .
The aer@@ on@@ au@@ tics often trade with technical questions by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus is calling directly to the public before the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ x , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We have recently seen what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financi@@ ers of a pho@@ to showing three people against one another in the restaur@@ ant , entitled “ Do you accept that ? ”
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ distance flights to seats in smaller seats than in regional tur@@ bo@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ ers &apos; , has indicated John Le@@ ah@@ y , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people grow , but the seats in aircraft have not changed radically .
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when the ju@@ m@@ b@@ o 7@@ 47 of Bo@@ eing defined modern long-@@ mail travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American of 4@@ 0-@@ 49 years rose by 10 % , according to data from the US Department of Health .
In the twenty-first century , the size of the average American is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 h@@ ens , according to US health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival is cl@@ inging to a concept of sie@@ ge that dates back to the 1950 ’ s , when the new@@ ly-@@ named “ j@@ et j@@ et ” movement was closer .
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional l@@ ump in the wid@@ th of seats would improve the quality of the sle@@ ep of 53 % .
Bo@@ eing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures with regard to the wid@@ th of seats and says that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment .
It also says that the study shows that experience in cab@@ in is not only dependent on the wid@@ th of seats .
&apos;@@ It really is a matter of providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , said K@@ ent C@@ ru@@ er , in charge of passenger satisfaction in Bo@@ eing .
They do not want them to be told what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more about having freedom of movement , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 trillion at the price of the market in decades to come , enough to shift the balance of US and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters said for the first time in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last aircraft .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing both claim a return on their own in their latest patterns of long-@@ run co@@ o@@ ters 20 % higher than the market leader in this seg@@ ment , Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ ER of 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing depends partly on the comparison between 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 per con@@ secu@@ tive seats and a 7@@ 77 of O@@ rig@@ in of O@@ rig@@ in .
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated de@@ vice with 10 seats per row currently in service .
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing is doing this in order to be able to fill more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products &apos; , said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , the head of Con@@ for@@ t P@@ ass@@ er in the European Airbus avi@@ ator .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say that the cab@@ in boo@@ ths with 10 seats per row in the existing 7@@ 77 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs .
&apos;@@ A s@@ ample of 18 h@@ ens would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , Airbus &apos;s proposal is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 &apos; , declared the internal expert of cab@@ in Kir@@ by , foun@@ der and ed@@ itor of R@@ un@@ way G@@ ir@@ l Network .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers , including airlines .
The ven@@ d@@ ors of aircraft who are around the world even have a me@@ tre in order to check competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While selling itself to offer comfortable aircraft , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with den@@ sely den@@ sity confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel .
Airbus offers an A@@ 350 confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus pointed out the need for greater person@@ alisation of cab@@ ins by offering larger seats on a number of its aircraft .
Without the support of the other major manufacturer of modern large appli@@ ances , experts say that it is unlikely that its appeal to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats will be successful , but that it could forget the sales wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X .
The shareholders of O@@ r@@ ac@@ le
A majority of US shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposed remuneration for the foun@@ der and Director General Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , given his group ’ s financial performance .
The vote is not binding , but it is a te@@ sta@@ ment to the image of Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , the third world fortune , just as just as the victory of his ship in the American Cup has just begun .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire still holds 25 % of the capital of the software group that he co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
As long ago as last year , El@@ bert had a negative vote on his pay .
O@@ r@@ ac@@ le ’ s bos@@ s re@@ linqu@@ ished a $ 1.2 million bon@@ us for the financial year 2013 in May , owing to the group ’ s poor performance , which l@@ acked its growth targets , but received around $ 77 million in stock options .
Its fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar .
O@@ ut of the entire 2013 financial year , the net benefit of O@@ r@@ ac@@ le grew by 3.5 % , while the stock market stock rate of 27@@ .5 % , over@@ performing the S &amp; P 500 index , which took 24 % at the same time .
The New S@@ co@@ reboard
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
A single do@@ se of the vaccine was able to protect the m@@ ouse from nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction .
Other tests are necessary before we begin the tests on human beings , but Professor R@@ on@@ ald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of the We@@ ill Cor@@ n@@ ell Me@@ di@@ cal College of New York has said that the first signs are encouraging .
‘ We very much hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exha@@ u@@ sting all the methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches , has said Professor Cor@@ n@@ ell .
The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus selec@@ tively infec@@ ts the li@@ ver cells , which then begins to produce a regular stream of anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies trade all nic@@ ot@@ ine m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules in the blood system and neutr@@ alize them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having his do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
When the tests were carried out , the m@@ ouse m@@ ouse , which was then given nic@@ ot@@ ine , continued to operate normally .
But the m@@ ouse who had not been vacc@@ inated “ were appe@@ ased ” said the researchers , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their brain .
Experi@@ ments are described in the jour@@ nal Science Trans@@ Latin Medic@@ ine .
Pre@@ vious vaccines against tobacco have proved ineffective because they contained anti@@ bodies .
The injec@@ tions had to be repeated so frequently that anti@@ bodies remain high that they were too expensive and in@@ convenient .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns the li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe , it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nic@@ ot@@ ine .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
“ They will know that if they start smoking they will not be happy with the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and that can help them to lose their bad habit , ” he added .
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have indicated that much more thorough research is needed .
The head of the Pakistani Taliban
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south , was killed in an American dr@@ one strike on Friday in Pakistan .
The death of H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south has been announced several times in the past .
But intelligence officials , the army , and the activis@@ t have claimed this time that they have lost their lives in this strike , conducted in the North W@@ az@@ ir@@ istan region .
&apos;@@ We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south was killed in a dr@@ one dr@@ one &apos; .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister N@@ awa@@ z Shar@@ if , travelling to London , informed the British Government that talks had been held with the Te@@ h@@ ri@@ k in Pakistan ( T@@ T@@ P ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ pol@@ di den@@ ies
The former Labour Minister of New Wales in the South Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di will be investigated by the state anti-@@ corruption regulator .
Former Minister of New Wales of South Wales Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di denied that he changed the trade policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three goods in the area controlled by the government .
On Friday , the Independent Commission Ag@@ ain@@ st Cor@@ ruption ( ICA@@ C ) broad@@ ened its investigation into whether Mr O@@ be@@ id had put pressure on a number of State ministers to renew his b@@ ones in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four , where the O@@ be@@ ds possess two restaur@@ ants and coffee , after their expiry in August 2005 , without any call for ten@@ ders .
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr Tri@@ po@@ di was aware of Mr O@@ be@@ id &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of the former Deputy Secretary-General of Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ po@@ le , on Thursday .
During the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government has pressed for the b@@ ones to be subject to ten@@ ders .
The ten@@ ants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , the be@@ ds concerning the companies in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four , which reported to O@@ be@@ id about $ 2.5 a year , were renewed without any call for ten@@ ders .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was Minister for Por@@ ts from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of ten@@ ders .
But he denied that he changed his policy at the request of Mr O@@ be@@ id , who recognised Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , called for a change in government policy on b@@ lending .
The trans@@ cri@@ ption of telephone convers@@ ations presented to the ICA@@ C has shown appeals in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who came to the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of Mr O@@ be@@ id to the Ministry of Fisheries .
&quot; The subject discussed during these telephone convers@@ ations was the development of trade policy , &quot; asked the Deputy Commissioner An@@ th@@ ony W@@ he@@ al@@ y to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&apos;@@ No &apos; , replied to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
I do not remember what we have discussed , but at least it was not .
Certainly not between me and Mr O@@ be@@ id .
Israeli War planes
Israeli war@@ planes reached a target in the Syrian port city of L@@ it@@ k@@ ia on Thursday evening , confirms a military officer at Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said that at least there was one .
The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 .
At least twice this year , Israel conducted air strikes against missiles in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa could have a “ auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity ” test .
The government is currently considering the possibility of putting in place a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity test &apos; for foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa while considering extending the repressive measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion for preventing 4@@ 57 visas from being used to occupy un@@ skilled posts or as a hi@@ j@@ ack to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A working document from the government has been un@@ ve@@ iled today , while Labour MEP Ma@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w denounced the government speech on foreign workers , saying that it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbours .
“ The f@@ rac@@ tured statements about &quot; foreigners returning to the end &quot; and &quot; jobs for Austr@@ ali@@ ans first &quot; are a dis@@ agre@@ eable return at the time when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , she said to the Austr@@ ali@@ an Indian Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , this meant that the work of the White Paper had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical ar@@ te@@ stan@@ t .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by the former Minister of Mi@@ gration Ch@@ ris Bow@@ en .
The Minister for Mi@@ gration B@@ ac@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials in order to discuss trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are under review .
If the &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; criterion was adopted , a visa see@@ ker could be checked on &apos; if the job supply is auth@@ enti@@ c in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person in the company that spons@@ ors spons@@ ors &apos; .
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 4@@ 57 after some of them , having intended to spons@@ or a small number of workers , actually employed hundreds .
Meanwhile , a 3@@ 0-@@ year-old Sri Lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker would be dead from a heart crisis after having arrived on a ship carrying asylum seekers on the island of Chris@@ t@@ mas this week .
The s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot of man , aged 9 , went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an adult c@@ ous@@ in who was also on board .
The man has been transferred as a matter of urgency by the Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities to the hospital in Chris@@ t@@ mas , where he died .
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work carried out by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ it@@ d suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of the P@@ ha@@ se 1 by 20@@ 26 .
The Transport Minister bar@@ on@@ ne K@@ ram@@ er said that the project would bring together the United Kingdom .
The Scottish Minister for Transport , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown , has said ‘ exc@@ itement ’ to working with the British Government on the project .
P@@ ha@@ se 1 will be on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When the P@@ ha@@ se 2 is completed , the lines will serve Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England , from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7 million to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 million .
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the length of journeys for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travel du@@ es between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh three hours at the most .
Baroness K@@ ram@@ er said : “ Our objective for H@@ S@@ 2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer . ”
We are pushing the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous .
Without it , we have a problem with the capacity of our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connec@@ tivity between the 18 large British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ lis@@ ta@@ r Car@@ mi@@ hel , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &apos;
For the Scottish Government , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown has called on Mr Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el to support the inclusion of Scotland in the H@@ S@@ 2 network unequivocally .
Mr Brown said : &apos; The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings Scotland &apos;s economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network across Britain .
‘ We are therefore exc@@ ited about working in partnership with the British Government to examine options for bringing the high-speed train network up to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and supple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
&quot; I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year , and then we will decide on the next steps together . &apos;
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia
Austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers will have to continue to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their t@@ ab@@ lets and s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies during take@@ -@@ off and landing despite the US gesture to ease the regulation of electronic devices .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch vide@@ os , or play games on their appli@@ ances during critical flight periods , provided they are in an air fashion .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do so for most of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to access their electronic books during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Austr@@ ali@@ an carriers are looking at the decision which obliges US carriers to do important work in order to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Aviation Authority also stated that it was examining the announcement , but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia .
‘ The CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft ’ .
The issue is subject to a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to ensure permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , who has already spoken to CA@@ SA about its intention to extend the use of its enter@@ tainment system using W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology , was open to change , but said that it would follow the regulator .
‘ We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe that this would improve the customer ’ s experience now that we have – from the on-@@ board enter@@ tainment system using W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology on our aeroplan@@ es – a spokesman .
Q@@ an@@ t@@ as has said that she is currently complying with the current rules .
&apos;@@ According to our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we do not intend to change this immediately &apos; , she said .
The FA@@ A decision applies to US airlines .
However , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that may benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For US carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio inter@@ ferences from electronic devices , as well as review tex@@ t@@ books , training equipment , hand@@ -@@ b@@ agg@@ age transport schemes and the instructions provided to passengers .
“ As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use ligh@@ t-@@ touch electronic devices , such as t@@ ab@@ lets , e-@@ ma@@ ker read@@ ers and s@@ mar@@ ph@@ ph@@ on@@ ies to all al@@ titudes , ” said the FA@@ A .
In the rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances during landing .
The group also recommended that heavi@@ er aircraft should be safe in the seats or in higher compar@@ tments during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
P@@ ia : at least four injured
The little of P@@ ia has experienced an unusual f@@ ever on Thursday evening .

On this day of H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en , the evening was sti@@ r@@ red up on the side of P@@ ia , where a ri@@ g involving several people broke out on the Po@@ st side .

Singapore ’ s C@@ l@@ ass l@@ enders
For a len@@ der at the B@@ end@@ em@@ er trade centre in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a is putting a bra@@ ke , a jo@@ ke , and a bu@@ ck of gold ear to pay for his d@@ augh@@ ters ’ scho@@ oling .
“ My hus@@ band and I have just bought a house , therefore , all my money , ” says Mrs A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
Although it ear@@ ns $ 3@@ ,000 in Singapore ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) per month as an ad@@ versary , and its hus@@ band is also working , monthly family income is not enough .
In fact , demand is such in parts of Sou@@ theast Asia – where household debt is rising – that V@@ alum@@ a@@ x , where it has carried out its transaction , has become the third loan company that will be introduced to the Singapore exchange .
P@@ utting je@@ wel@@ s out is not only a quick way to get liquid money – $ 1 300 in Singapore in the case of Mrs A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but it is almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
In general , the Singapore l@@ enders set up an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by the United O@@ ver@@ se@@ as Bank , a local fund provider with a branch in the same business centre .
But there is the advantage of not asking for a cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or salary check , and can release loans faster than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region turn to the l@@ enders , while families are feeling the pressure of rising living costs and over-@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fueled by too lax a monetary policy in advanced economies , low-@@ income and middle-@@ income families turn to collateral l@@ enders to bridge the difference while their economies are slowing .
This week , the credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora cited the growing debt of households , resulting mainly from the rise in mortgage lending , as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore had the highest debt-@@ to-@@ GDP ratio in Asia .
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , while the rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged this week from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
“ The balance sheet is that , with the rise in costs , people in the middle or the bottom are seeking to supplement their income as they can , ” says S@@ ong S@@ en@@ g W@@ u@@ n , an economist at IC@@ M@@ B , an Malay@@ sian bank .
His@@ tor@@ ically high gold prices over the past two years have meant that people have been quick to make their personal impact felt to affect the cash value of their je@@ wel@@ s .
In Singapore , about 70 % of the items in the 200 bu@@ o@@ d-@@ state lending shops are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us have the gold chain of grand@@ mother &apos; and we will look back next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest loan bro@@ ker operator , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , has recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using their shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the loan sector that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , B@@ end@@ em@@ er , and 15 other slu@@ dge such as this in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighb@@ oring Malaysia – where there are already four slu@@ dge – but also outside Asia , says Y@@ e@@ ah Le@@ e Ch@@ ing , its Directorate-General .
Society will finance them by using 60 % of the $ 66 trillion in Singapore that it removed this week from its introduction to the Singapore exchange .
While some low-@@ interest l@@ enders have suffered criticism for the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates that they are practi@@ sing , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah indicates that the supply offers not only lower rates than other l@@ enders , but also does not directly increase debt .
“ The customers are selling goods that they already have , and mone@@ tiz@@ ing their personal goods does not increase household debt , ” she says .
The establishment is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining short-term funding .
The people who travel to the l@@ enders are not just those who have financial problems .
The ai@@ ded people of Singapore are also going to the V@@ alum@@ a@@ x loan bu@@ ff@@ er in order to build up gold lo@@ oms or Ro@@ le@@ x mon@@ sters , which can represent up to 60 % of their cash purchase prices .
We see customers from all sections of society .
“ It may be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment activities , or small businesses with cash needs to go a difficult course , ” adding M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need money very quickly .
P@@ ast@@ er accused of juven@@ ile pornography in New Scotland
A father who took care of young people in the H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x region in New Scotland is accused of juven@@ ile pornography .
A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ud@@ g@@ ins , 30 years old , was arrested on Friday morning following sear@@ ches at his home and at the National Research Council Office where he works .
The B@@ ap@@ tist church of Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ y , where the official officer was , is deeply sadd@@ ened by this news .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , the church officials indicate that Mr H@@ ud@@ g@@ ins has resigned from his post .
The bos@@ s has been released under conditions .
In particular , it must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet .
He will appear in prov@@ in@@ cial court in H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in December .
He is in Nazi uniform in the super@@ market .
A man d@@ ressed in a Nazi uniform of a bre@@ w@@ ard with the gam@@ b@@ led cross was asked to leave an English super@@ market , with customers complaining to the leadership of the establishment that called the police , indicated the shop on Friday .
&apos;@@ We have received several complaints from customers , so we have asked him to leave the shop &apos; , explained a spokesman for the super@@ market in As@@ da .
The shop called the police to rescue him , but &apos; the time she arri@@ ves , he has already gone un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed &apos; .

$ 3@@ 25 million rescue plan for the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia health system
The federal government maintains that the $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package for the health care system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that government government does not waste money .
The Federal Minister of Health T@@ an@@ ya Pol@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is currently taking “ urgent measures ” to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
The funding , planned for four years , was decided after consultations with the independent Member of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia , An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&apos;@@ The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which , in our view , will solve the unique difficulties that the State is facing &apos; , said Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
The 3@@ 25 M plan includes a $ 31 M campaign for non-@@ urgent sur@@ gical operations .
A further 2 600 operations , including or@@ th@@ opa@@ e@@ dic sur@@ ger@@ y and cat@@ ar@@ act , will help catch up .
Funds are also planned for clin@@ ics without meetings at H@@ ob@@ art and L@@ au@@ n@@ c@@ es@@ ton , better external care , training of medical frameworks , mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical files in local hospitals .
“ These investments respond to the idea that , according to first-@@ line clin@@ ic@@ ians , this is the best way to cure the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia health system , ” Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
The Minister said that the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia Government would be faced with a strict regime of preparation for reports and reporting .
The state will have to maintain the current levels of funding to receive money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends the additional funds .
A committee of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said today that the 3@@ 25 M will not count for much &apos; unless they are followed by genuine reform to consolidate the public health system of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos; .
Nevertheless , he congratulated the government on responding to the urgent request for assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister in early May .
&quot; I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system of T@@ as@@ man@@ on from the black@@ list , Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie .
According to the government government , these non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But the health opposition spokes@@ person Peter Du@@ t@@ ton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a “ ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft solution . ”
“ The reason we are here is that the state Labour Government has withdrawn 4@@ 30 M from its health system , ” he said on A@@ BC TV .
We cannot have a government government that takes up almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth , which puts $ 300 , and claim that it is a good day .
Mr D@@ ut@@ ton visited Mrs Pol@@ liber@@ se@@ k to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , says the supervisory body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for producing chemical weapons and am@@ muni@@ tion with toxic gas , declared the international chemical weapons monitoring body on Thursday , while violent clashes were ra@@ ging in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago .
The announcement of the Organisation for the banning of chemical weapons ( ICA@@ O ) came with one day on the deadline of the deadline for the deadline for the banning of chemical weapons .
1 November set by the organisation based in The Hague ord@@ ering Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &apos; make all units of chemical weapons and machinery to mix toxic gases and fill am@@ muni@@ tion un@@ us@@ able &apos; .
The completion of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Dam@@ as@@ cus &apos;s chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014 .
With the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves .
It is estimated that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the s@@ ar@@ in neuro@@ toxic agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was ra@@ ging on Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fi@@ ra , which , according to experts , is home to a unit of production of chemical weapons and storage sites , reported the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory based in Britain .
The group of activists , following the development of the human balance through a network of milit@@ ants based in Syria , said on Thursday that 120 2@@ 96 people died .
Of them , there were 61 0@@ 67 civilians , including 6 3@@ 65 children .
On the government side , it is estimated that 29 9@@ 54 members of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad ’ s armed forces died , including 18 6@@ 78 fighters of pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 Lebanese Hezbollah milit@@ ants .
Of the deaths , it is also estimated that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ ters and some 5 3@@ 75 of the opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since then .
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
Assad ’ s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to al-@@ Qaeda groups , in Sa@@ af@@ ra for weeks .
The Centre said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but did not give any prec@@ ision .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsen@@ al in the midst of a civil war that is continuing , within tight deadlines .
A statement by the O@@ I@@ C , which works in close collaboration with the UN , indicated that its team was “ now satisfied with controlled – and destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mi@@ xing and filling . ”
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was scheduled for the moment &apos; .
Ear@@ lier this week the inspectors said that they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their security , indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the ICA@@ O said that the two sites , according to Syria , were &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the S@@ af@@ ra unit was one of the two sites that the ICA@@ O inspectors were unable to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which was approved by the I@@ IA@@ C Executive Committee .
“ I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all demonstrated in the most difficult task ever undertaken by this organisation , ” declared the Director-General of the organisation Ah@@ met U@@ zu@@ escu , in a comment published by the ICA@@ O .
Now , in its third year , the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels in the Assad government and its security forces , which are supported by members of the al@@ a@@ ou@@ i sec@@ t , a branch of Shia Islam .
On the other hand , the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of L@@ it@@ k@@ ia .
The cause of the explosion remains unknown , he added .
A Col@@ um@@ bus caused by the punishment of one of Bali
The survi@@ v@@ ors and relatives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence imposed on the last of the con@@ spir@@ ators to be brought to justice , saying that U@@ mar P@@ ate@@ k should be shot by an implementing l@@ unch .
P@@ ate@@ k , who spent almost 10 years in flight by being one of the most sought men in South-East Asia , was sentenced yesterday to a 20-@@ year-old prison sentence for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks .
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
The 4@@ 5-@@ year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two night bo@@ xes in the popular tourist district of K@@ ut@@ a , which caused the deaths of 20@@ 2 people , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and caused many injured .
It has also been found guilty of many other charges in relation to terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The prosecu@@ tors have asked for a sentence of life punishment , yet they could have asked for the man , known as the &apos; M@@ an M@@ an &apos; for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs , to be condemned to death .
The decision revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Per@@ th who lost her two tw@@ in two tw@@ ins , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction perpetrated by P@@ ate@@ k and the other con@@ spir@@ ators nearly 10 years ago .
On the brink of te@@ ars , she said that P@@ ate@@ k should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should have gone along with the other men .
&apos;@@ He should be dra@@ gged before the execu@@ ting &apos; , said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en to the A@@ PA .
I have to live on a daily basis without having any other grand@@ children or my d@@ augh@@ ters .
The Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was fully destroyed when an enormous bomb , charged in a g@@ ate of g@@ ag@@ ging abroad , explo@@ ded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in P@@ ad@@ dy@@ d@@ is B@@ ar when a suicide bom@@ ber s@@ acked a s@@ ack with explo@@ si@@ ves with only 20 seconds earlier .
He s@@ ank in the com@@ a after the attack and remained un@@ conscious for a month , and he is “ dead ” three times when he was under res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that P@@ ate@@ k should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah responsible for car@@ n@@ age – Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ l@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
To keep it alive is why there is no reason to keep it alive .
It is not much .
P@@ ate@@ k is the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being cap@@ tured for almost 10 years , but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Ab@@ bot@@ be@@ te , where US forces will kill former al-@@ Qaeda leader Os@@ ama bin Laden , less than four months later .
During the trial , an agent of the F@@ B@@ I said that reports of intelligence services revealed that P@@ ate@@ k was in Pakistan to meet B@@ in Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al Qaeda .
&quot; He did not go , &quot; added Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
Until recently , he was har@@ med by the s@@ orrow he had been able to cause to others .
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by cere@@ monies in Bali and Australia .
“ There will be a lot of be@@ aches this year , ” Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en said .
However , P@@ ate@@ k can use his condemnation .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on board aircraft ( but not through their mobile phone )
Pass@@ eng@@ ers of airlines will be able to use their electronic g@@ ad@@ -@@ door devices to read , work , play games , watch films , and listen to music – but not to talk about their mobile phone – under the new , very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another , declared the adminis@@ tr@@ ator of the FA@@ A Mic@@ hael Hu@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
Air@@ lines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the crew training books and the rules on the conformity of aircraft to be in conformity .
The FA@@ A has stated that it has already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of electronic devices on their aircraft .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ Blue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&apos;@@ depending on the plan , we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon &apos; , indicated the FA@@ A in a statement .
At present , passengers must ext@@ ingu@@ ish their s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , t@@ ab@@ lets and other appli@@ ances as soon as the doors of the plane are closed .
They are not supposed to r@@ ally them before the plane reaches an al@@ titude of 10 000 feet and the comm@@ ander gives the green light .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances on the des@@ cent of the plane before the landing , and not to r@@ ash them up until the plane has been created .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take@@ -@@ off , landing and ground rolling , declared the FA@@ A .
Most of the new air@@ planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to higher al@@ titude , should meet the criteria .
L@@ will G@@ lad@@ ing , Chair of the Association of Pro@@ visi@@ onal F@@ light At@@ temp@@ ts , was pleased about these changes .
“ Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with carriers for that – it will benefit everyone , ” explained G@@ lad@@ ing in a statement .
We are , frankly , tired of feeling like ‘ h@@ orm@@ one ’ when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet for sur@@ f@@ ing , exchanging em@@ ail , and SM@@ S or down@@ loading data below 10 000 feet , declared the agency .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , t@@ ab@@ lets and other aircraft aircraft .
So , still not at Wor@@ ds W@@ it@@ h Fri@@ ends , the S@@ r@@ b@@ ble game that the actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ w@@ in played on his mar@@ sh@@ ph@@ one in 2011 when he was expelled from an American Air@@ lines aeroplan@@ e after refusing to ext@@ ingu@@ ish his apparatus when the apparatus was kept at the door .
And heavi@@ er appli@@ ances such as lap@@ top@@ s will always have to be con@@ tested because they could inj@@ ure someone if they were flying through the cab@@ in .
mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A
Last month , Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of the National Transport Stand@@ ard Sa@@ fe@@ y B@@ ard , a national transport safety expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , said that mobile phones were always considered a risk .
&apos;@@ The mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with the navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the F@@ CC@@ C , that they could dis@@ rupt mobile tele@@ phones if they are used on board &apos; , said Ros@@ en@@ ker .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government permits the wider use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has increased in recent years to rela@@ x restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ ator C@@ l@@ aire Mc@@ Cas@@ k@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o , argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of aircraft has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous .
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances , or deliberately do so .
The FA@@ A began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communications instruments when passengers were carrying radi@@ os F@@ M , the high-tech g@@ ad@@ gets of then .
New air@@ planes are much more dependent on electric systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
Air@@ lines allow their passengers to use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to cru@@ ise al@@ legi@@ ance for several years .
The modified aircraft to host W@@ i-@@ F@@ i systems are also better res@@ isting interference .
The vast majority of air@@ planes should allow the wider use of electronic devices under the new directives .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much weaker radio transmission than previous generations of aircraft .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic books , for example , only em@@ it minimum trans@@ missions when you turn a page .
But trans@@ missions are stronger when it comes to down@@ loading or sending data .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is one of those who lobby for rela@@ xing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , the company ’ s leaders charged a K@@ ind@@ le e-@@ ma@@ ker air@@ -@@ on-@@ line aircraft and fly to see if there were problems , but there was none .
This inspired the members of the FA@@ A advisory committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of aircraft presents a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said that he believed that interference from aircraft was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee said that there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots indicating that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems , and most of them are very old .
However , the committee has recommended that the FA@@ A should allow pil@@ ots to ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances during landing to instruments under low visibility conditions .
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes , calling for full arrangements of common sense for travellers with technologies .
‘ We are pleased that the FA@@ A recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security ’ , said Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , President and Director of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tra@@ vel Association .
A North Sea platform
A bir@@ d , sh@@ el@@ ded after having been exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea , has been released in nature .
The water r@@ ank was raised on a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter in A@@ ber@@ de@@ en last month before the Scottish S@@ PC@@ A was released in its Al@@ o@@ va rescue centre .
The center of the center , Col@@ in S@@ ed@@ don , said : “ This water r@@ ank was probably a winter migratory that came from northern Europe and found itself in the midst of violent win@@ ds in the North Sea . ”
It seems that the old bir@@ d would have found refuge on the oil platform .
He added : ‘ He was unable to fly again , so we were cont@@ acted to help him . ’
The water r@@ ank was healthy when it was released .
Is the European elite prepared to do business with Britain ?
The Business for Brit@@ ain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together companies and defining what the creat@@ ors of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
In order to do this , we have commissioned the wid@@ est and most complete investigation into British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , businesses and the EU .
Y@@ ou@@ Goe@@ v questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , who are generally representative of all sizes of companies , sectors and regions of Britain .
The findings of the inquiry will come as a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on the countries that are modern@@ izing and developing while EU states are stag@@ n@@ ating .
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming the European institutional ar@@ can@@ e .
When asked for their opinion on specific political points – ranging from the regulation of the monopolies to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key skills should go back to West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market has caused general dis@@ content , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that there is to be part of the European trade area – 40 % of large companies , traditionally the most pro-European ones , even agree .
Last but not least , our investigation into business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to continue the initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .
This conclusion , which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a “ significant change ” that gives power to the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high – a change in the treaty and better representing Britain ’ s interests would mean a 16 % shift in votes in favor of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not doubt just one moment : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that companies hope that the re@@ negotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power for a return to the UK .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of British companies , since the eurozone is committed to closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for companies this means placing the emphasis once again on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels .
The United States to H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en
In the US , President Obama has not devi@@ ated from the tradition of H@@ all@@ we@@ en .

Alex@@ i Mill@@ er of Gaz@@ pro@@ m says that Bulgaria ’ s gas pipeline in@@ hi@@ b@@ its a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s director .
&apos;@@ An historic event has taken place today : construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the most important project in Europe &apos; , explained Alex@@ i Mill@@ er , the Director-General of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of Europe .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its Ukrainian counterpart , a country in which most Russian gas is transported to Europe , increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes , adds the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated &apos; forever &apos; .
Bulgarian consumers will receive the gas from South Stream at a reduced tariff once the whole project is put into operation in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m has indicated that construction should start in other countries down@@ stream by the end of the year .
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n
The Is@@ le of Pit@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n wants to create the world &apos;s largest marine reserve , announced on Thursday the New Year of Ta@@ hi@@ i , taking on an information from Rad@@ io Australia .
This island , in the east of the G@@ am@@ er archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last British territory in the South Pacific , half@@ way between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory is 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , with three other small islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the muti@@ l@@ ated of the Bou@@ ty , the episo@@ de of the English na@@ vy , which gave rise to three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adap@@ tations .
A few dozen inhabitants , most of whom are des@@ c@@ endants of the F@@ loo@@ ty , still live in Pit@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n , and their incomes depend on 95 % of London ’ s generosity .
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , which is 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 which correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the may@@ or of the island went to London asking Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ n , the May@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n , believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for its island .
The project must be accepted by the English Govern@@ or of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to s@@ cra@@ p these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided , however , that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in Pit@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance in the area , and there is no port in which to place military surveillance vessels .
As for France , it must already carry out the very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 of the French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia E@@ E@@ Z , which is a neighbour of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n .

A P@@ ris@@ on for a former Chinese Deputy Govern@@ or
A former deputy govern@@ or of the province of Ji@@ in in nor@@ theast China was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption .
Ex@@ clu@@ ded from the Communist Party in July 2012 , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of having affected more than 19 million y@@ u@@ ans of bri@@ bes , reporting Chinese official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Govern@@ or , who was also the President of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public establishment , helped companies and responsible to obtain contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first interim court in Beijing on his micro@@ phone .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party .
If the head of state promised that justice would also be in@@ trac@@ table with the powerful &apos; tig@@ ers &apos; , the sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent civil servants - only a handful of senior officials were sentenced , including former managers of the oil giant Pe@@ tro@@ ch@@ ina .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CC@@ P chief in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office in the state .
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-@@ corruption system by creating , for example , an independent party .
Two Y@@ M@@ A employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , at a ro@@ yal Commission hearing .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees in New Wales have been accused of sexual assault against children following allegations against the Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h educ@@ ator , J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , in 2011 , at a ro@@ yal Commission hearing charged with child sex abuse .
But in his opening statement to the Commission , the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A said that it had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children within its organisation . &apos;
The Director General Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ re was asked about two cases : an employee of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a P@@ M@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all physical education instruc@@ tor was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre in which he worked in 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ re said to G@@ ail Fr@@ ü@@ n@@ ess , who is a lawyer to the Commission , that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the IC@@ M@@ A opening statement was in@@ accurate by under@@ lining , “ external controls of the Y@@ M@@ A have been made and have indicated that child safety is an absolute priority for the organisation . ”
It has been demonstrated to the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ A had been informed that it had received a few more poor assessments of four institutions in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Comm@@ uni@@ ties in August this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who began to work in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord , and he failed to check that the employees knew that they were obliged to report any violation of child safety policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked in the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A .
He has been sentenced to a six@@ -year prison sentence .
But Mr Ha@@ re rejected the idea that the Y@@ M@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord &apos;s shortcomings in child safety .
The members of staff have shown that they have observed certain shortcomings , including the fact that Lord remained alone with children , that he kept them in private , made them sit on his k@@ nees , told them that he loved them and left them with his mobile phone .
Dan@@ i@@ el@@ ell O@@ ck@@ well , who was regulated by Lord and asked for training for child protection because she was worried about her behaviour , indicated that she found the child service responsible for the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ b@@ ach , J@@ ac@@ is Bar@@ n@@ at , who would be a very intimid@@ ating and difficult Lord .
The Director-General said that he rejected the staff testi@@ monies that they were reluctant to report these failings to their hier@@ arch@@ ical superi@@ ors .
Instead , he said that his friendly relations with Lord have bl@@ un@@ tled their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Ha@@ re said that he had expressed his point of view before the South Wales council of New Wales saying that , for the organisation , the lesson learned from the &apos; J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord incident &apos; should not be &apos; reporting by staff &apos; , and the Council agrees with him .
Mr Ha@@ re has said that the decision to sign up to the staff of the confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations have been made , was taken by the Director-General of the Y@@ M@@ IC@@ A , Li@@ am White .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence , but that it was an &apos; excess ze@@ al &apos; and had been badly implemented .
The Y@@ M@@ A in New Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord was employed , namely between 2009 and 2011 , declared the expert on sexual violence against children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ m@@ all@@ one of the University of G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith before the Commission .
He said that there were &apos; serious problems &apos; in recruitment , control , initi@@ ation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return to prime minister , but recognize that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term , the 5@@ 5@@ -year man made his views on various national policies known .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the top of the country , Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet ’ s special envoy for the Middle East peace process .
When asked if he would like to return to the post of prime minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to E@@ ven@@ ing Stand@@ ard in London : &apos; Yes , of course , but may it happen ? &apos;
When many experts in qu@@ a@@ estors met in Cardiff to face up to and win the ho@@ ph@@ y of the year , they knew that competition would be tough .
But no one expected to see F@@ ren@@ on Kir@@ res , a three-year child .
Not yet at school , and only a few months after having made its first weapons , the tw@@ in , She@@ t@@ land T@@ off@@ e , tro@@ t@@ ted in the three rounds with great ease and won the first price , leaving the 30 other adult competitors behind them .
The two in@@ separ@@ able in@@ separ@@ ables – which are the same size – were sal@@ u@@ ted for the presentation , attitude , and style of the annual contest that took place at the center of S@@ un@@ n@@ y@@ ban@@ k , in R@@ ud@@ y near Cardiff .
Com@@ ing against men and women in e@@ leg@@ ant me@@ te@@ ers , he had his h@@ at on the side in a rela@@ xed way in order to def@@ y his ten@@ -@@ year-old T@@ offer pon@@ y around the run@@ way .
The judges have been welcomed by the judges for their un@@ common natural qualities for a child of his age .
And T@@ offer received very good notes for his presentation and personality .
On the one hand , there was T@@ off@@ e@@ e for his 3@@ r@@ d birth@@ day last March , and has since taken place with his pon@@ ey She@@ t@@ land every day .
His mother Don@@ a , 30 years ago , said : &apos; T@@ ren@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e do an excellent du@@ o &apos; .
They have presented themselves to and against everyone , but the two have ra@@ zed the gold cut and the roc@@ ket .
It was only the second time that he had lived with T@@ off@@ e@@ e and we were ins@@ ane that he won .
On the run@@ way , people who did not know that it was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to photo@@ grap@@ h with him .
This young bo@@ y , the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ ub@@ ow V@@ ale , in southern Wales , is following the foot@@ steps of his counterpart Sharon H@@ ow@@ el@@ ls , who has been participating in qu@@ a@@ estors for more than 10 years .
Mrs Howitt said : &apos; There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging it and applau@@ ded it &apos; .
He has travelled all the way and even if he seemed to be very small , he did a wonderful job .
It is a fo@@ g of animals – it ad@@ mits hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors , and the rural world and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens .
From the way he has started , he will surely be taking part in this year ’ s Ch@@ ev@@ al demonstration – and I am sure he will make a good contribution .
A spokes@@ person for the annual question@@ er said : &apos; T@@ ran@@ ve only three years , but he knows how to conduct his pon@@ y &apos; .
They are a good team .
The judges noted that Pen@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e presented well and the way in which they mar@@ ched on the track .
They are looking for effective te@@ am@@ work between the pon@@ der and the tra@@ in@@ er – Pen@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e have been the best on the track .
I am sure his beautiful clo@@ thes helped F@@ ment@@ on , he really was proud .
A Chinese newspaper , which launched an appeal :
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-@@ page call for the release of a journalist accused of def@@ am@@ ation is going to be revised , says a press regulator .
The New Ex@@ press based in Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Mr Ch@@ en subsequently admitted on television that he had accepted bri@@ bes to make stories about a semi-@@ public society .
Now the New Ex@@ press is going to undergo a “ complete overhaul , ” the regulator said .
The order of “ res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le ” comes from Gu@@ ang@@ don ’ s administration for P@@ ress and E@@ di@@ tion , Rad@@ io , F@@ il@@ m , and Tele@@ vision .
A preliminary survey showed that the New Ex@@ press , belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing Ne@@ ws group , published a number of er@@ ron@@ eous articles on the Z@@ o@@ om@@ li@@ on society between September 2012 and August 2013 .
“ New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organised , ” the regulator said in a statement .
He said that he had decided &apos; to impose an administrative sanction in Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press card &apos; .
He also “ ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he should conduct an investigation into the people responsible in New Ex@@ press and immediately re@@ direct the newspaper ’ s leadership team . ”
Mr Ch@@ en wrote several articles for the New Ex@@ press on alleged financial irregularities of a shipy@@ ard manufacturer known as Z@@ o@@ om@@ li@@ on .
After his arrest , his newspaper published on two occasions a first-@@ page call for his release , writing that he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Mr Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories about money .
“ In this case , I damaged Z@@ o@@ om@@ li@@ on and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he said to the public television network C@@ CC@@ TV .
I did so mainly because I was running after the money and the celebr@@ ity .
I have seen my error .
Following the apologies of Mr Ch@@ en , New Ex@@ press made his apologies on the first page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects have recently made television judgments .
Experts say that people are systematically forced to do their own , despite a change in the law that was adopted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to blame himself .
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaul@@ le
In T@@ oul@@ on , the aircraft carrier is on the ra@@ ils .
The le@@ ak of radioactive v@@ ap@@ our detected on one of the two nuclear he@@ at@@ ers of Char@@ le@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le in mid-@@ October , while the ship was at sea , was &apos; safe for seafarers &apos; , but it is not without consequences for the Mar@@ ine .
Indeed , the Ro@@ yal has just confirmed to us &apos; the un@@ availability &apos; of the vessel until &apos; mid-@@ November &apos; , &apos; time to take the necessary corrective measures &apos; on the reactor .
For its part , the D@@ N@@ S@@ -@@ speci@@ alist company , D@@ N@@ C , ensures that its teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , who are caught in the V@@ ar for the time being , &apos; intervene on aircraft carriers &apos; .
It is for them , among other things , to change a p@@ ump on the faul@@ ty heating .
&apos;@@ Everything is being done to ensure that Charles de Gaul@@ le can make his planned deployment at the end of 2013 &apos; .
And the national Mari@@ ine to certi@@ fy that &apos; it does not call into question the nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion programme &apos; .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaul@@ le is out of an interim period of six months .
In mid-@@ October , he set up T@@ oul@@ on for training .
This , in particular , is to describe young hunting pil@@ ots .
A &apos; small ch@@ arity &apos; , which is confined to the contain@@ ment space of the reactor , was then produced on the flagship ship of the French fleet .
According to the National Mar@@ ine , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a great deal of dis@@ content on the part of the people I meet : the mon@@ str@@ ous re@@ valuation of their properties , the deduc@@ tion of taxes , the cost of all kinds of licences , the administrative costs that are not ending .
In short , there is no limit to our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of squ@@ an@@ dered dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful tax on those who pay .
Any money taken away from the taxpayer is reducing their freedom of consumption and contributing to their impover@@ ishment .
In Sh@@ aw@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , there is no embarr@@ ass@@ ment about s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ary spending and the maintenance of lame duc@@ ks : a defici@@ ent cultural centre , a strong subsidy to the Energy City , etc .
If these facilities are not profitable , they are sold to private companies or are being scrap@@ ped .
It is also sad to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come .
However , I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a kind of industrial inc@@ ub@@ ator , but at what cost to tax pay@@ ers ?
It is not up to the public to invest in such companies , but to the private sector on the basis of consumer demand .
People were pleased to learn that the la@@ kes in the Fisheries and Pi@@ als will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
As a result of the departure of all industries ( large water consumers ) and the large decline in the population , water use has fallen considerably across the territory .
Without wishing to waste it , the city will never miss water , and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly admi@@ red .
In short , it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others .
I would be ashamed to defend such a review .
With a gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a p@@ en without a loan regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years by sk@@ ies with great qualifications for most , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse .
O@@ wing to a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric ra@@ ils , has been discovered .
The US authorities have described the 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages that they had ever seen .
The tunnel , z@@ z@@ z@@ ag@@ ging on a length of almost six long-term football fields , connec@@ ts w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ j@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go , the United States .
The area is full of in@@ trac@@ table w@@ are@@ houses , which makes it easy to conceal the tr@@ uc@@ ks responsible for drugs .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it , and the authorities said that they were .
The authorities confisc@@ ated 8@@ .5 tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel was discovered , according to legal cases .
Three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers , were accused of possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e with a sales intention .
They are running a prison sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are condemned .
In No@@ g@@ als , in Ari@@ z@@ ona , traffickers exploit extensive underground dra@@ in@@ age channels .
The tunnel is the eigh@@ th important passage in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the largest tun@@ n@@ els were discovered as a result of the mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in the centre of Mexico in October , posing a challenge for drug car@@ t@@ els that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 y@@ ards f@@ itted with railways from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of a Ti@@ j@@ ana house and went to two San Di@@ e@@ go w@@ are@@ houses .
The British police
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the foun@@ der of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge in Ecu@@ ador &apos;s Ambassador in London and called for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said that she had issued a “ surrender opinion ” against Austr@@ ali@@ ans of 40 years , asking him to present himself to a police commission , adding that if he did not , he could be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime , having exhausted every possible aven@@ ue under the British law after the Supreme Court invali@@ dated the appeal that it made against its extradition at the beginning of the month .
C@@ ho@@ sting that Stockholm allows its transfer to the United States , it found refuge in Ecu@@ ador &apos;s Am@@ bas@@ sy in London on 19 June , asking that country of South America political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard has “ issued an opinion against a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man who calls on him to present himself to a police officer , on date , and when his choice , ” declared a spokesman .
It continues to violate the conditions for its release under b@@ ail .
The Ambassador has refused to comment on the issue of issuing the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange is afraid to be extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of es@@ pion@@ age , having un@@ ve@@ iled more than 250 000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website fighting secret information .
How Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics
Fin@@ n the words to be t@@ asked with access to his or her S@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by the biometric cap@@ tors of phones and computers .
Ber@@ n@@ ard Di@@ di@@ er , Deputy Director of Mor@@ ph@@ o , even believes that the century will be biometric .
Only biome@@ tr@@ ics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in such a cross-border and transnational world as the Internet .
Organis@@ ations dedicated to the protection of private life confirm this en@@ sla@@ vement for biome@@ tr@@ ics , but are concerned about it .
In 2011 and France alone , the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorised 7@@ 74 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the form of hand or the ve@@ in@@ ous network of hand in companies , administrations , can@@ te@@ ens ...
“ Everyone can soon be identified , anywhere and no matter ” , moved Ju@@ ti@@ in Bro@@ o@@ k@@ man , who is responsible for consumer privacy in the CD@@ C ( C@@ enter for Democracy and Technology ) , in Washington .
The reasons for such optimism , among some and pessimis@@ m , among others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics will be based on new techniques , which will enable new services to be made available to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are finger@@ printing , the hand of hand and the ve@@ in network of the p@@ ause or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;@@ For example , some people who work the concrete have the fin@@ gers of the fin@@ gers and their fingerprints are un@@ read@@ able &apos; , notes Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , the technical director of the identity area in Th@@ ales Communic@@ ations .
And the collection and verification of the ve@@ in@@ ous network and the hand of hand mean a voluntary and precise gesture of people .
It is both a safety - one cannot capture the data from them - and one draw@@ back : the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time .
As a result , research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches , such as the recognition of face or m@@ ouse ( the col@@ our@@ ful part ) .
With the increase in the accuracy of the cap@@ tors and the ability to calculate the computers required for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The prec@@ ision of fac@@ ial recognition has increased ten times over the last five years , along with C@@ y@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , head of R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border post@@ ers using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or an m@@ ouse on the move .
&apos;@@ Today we are carrying out research into the recognition of the voice or the way in which we can walk with sound sen@@ s@@ ors , but we need a silent environment &apos; , says S@@ r@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , the head of security research to In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
A unique and inf@@ alli@@ ble Mar@@ qu@@ er , the DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
&apos;@@ In the current state of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirms S@@ op@@ hi@@ -@@ T@@ ul@@ li@@ er , the Director of the Stu@@ dies , Innovation and Pro@@ vision for C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But DNA analysis is still very long and costly .
It is proposed that the judicial police services should be worth EUR 9@@ 0@@ ,000 to analyse DNA s@@ amples in the place of a crime and in an hour .
The use of biome@@ tr@@ ics is divided into two groups : identification ( recognising one person among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( ensuring that the person is the one it claims to be ) .
The identification has so far concerned the issuing of identity papers : biometric elements ( fingerprints , pho@@ to and i@@ is ) have to be confronted with the information that the state has on all citizens already enshrined .
This helps to ensure that someone does not try to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison may have other applications .
This is why it is proposed that V@@ V@@ P should be recognised in a ho@@ tel or shop .
&apos;@@ We are recovering the images of the surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compar@@ ing them with the photo@@ s of the cele@@ bri@@ ties circul@@ ating freely on the Internet &apos; , explains Dan@@ y N@@ assi@@ f , who is responsible , at N@@ EC France , for commercial development for biometric identification solutions .
Another use is to look at a sha@@ m that is qu@@ eu@@ ing in a shop , to follow its progress through fac@@ ial recognition and calculate waiting times .
Re@@ ification initially concerned physical access ( borders , protected local , can@@ te@@ ens , etc . ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
More recently , there has been a review of the presence .
&apos;@@ A biometric point avoi@@ ds the phenomenon of the C@@ op@@ tic which is leading for another &apos; , justifies Cy@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , Ac@@ cen@@ te .
More and more , however , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also concern transactions , especially those made from Internet connections .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric read@@ er : this gesture re@@ places the h@@ all@@ mark of the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is tested in V@@ ill@@ en@@ u@@ ve@@ ve@@ -@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and in An@@ g@@ us@@ ory by the Nat@@ ural Security company in partnership with the big distribution banks and teachers : when paying in shop with its banking card , the customer is not t@@ reading his code , but he is bringing his finger into a read@@ er who is scan@@ ning the cal@@ ves .
The experiment is planned for six months .
If it is conclu@@ sive , biometric read@@ ers may soon reach French traders .
Mo@@ ves to reassure users
There are three ways to make biome@@ tr@@ ics attractive to the general public .
The first is to explain that it can save time .
&quot; If , thanks to biome@@ tr@@ ics , a cli@@ ent remains in 30 seconds less , it is good , &quot; explains the director of a large area .
The second is to offer person@@ alised services : in a few years &apos; time , a voice ser@@ ver will be able to recognise your voice and propose tail@@ or-@@ made options .
And finally , reassuring by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;@@ fingerprints are stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos; s identities are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure bo@@ xes , which are blocked if you try to move it &apos; , lists Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , Th@@ ales .
But , without in-depth studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
Pri@@ vate privacy experts continue to worry .
&apos;@@ The progress of fac@@ ial recognition , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and the huge quantity of photo@@ graph@@ s available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or Pi@@ cam@@ a , leads me to fear the worst : widespread surveillance &apos; , predicted An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , the Commissioner for Pri@@ vate Protection in Canada .
A driver of 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink between leg@@ s has been me@@ ted out of £ 1 000 .
A car driver has been fin@@ ed £ 1 000 for driving at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink that is balanced between his leg@@ s .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ ie , 35 years of Ti@@ pp@@ y in Es@@ sex , was re@@ pai@@ red leading his Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 to B@@ ran@@ tre@@ e on 27 May .
When the police arrested it , they discovered the drink to take between its leg@@ s .
In the Court of First In@@ stance of Col@@ um@@ bia , H@@ ow@@ a admitted a breach of conduct without the necessary caution and attention .
The seven points that have been withdrawn from the permit have led to a six-month withdrawal of licences .
H@@ ow@@ a has also been sentenced to pay for £ 90 , and an over@@ tax for the victim of £ 100 .
A Tax on Foreign home@@ owners
The Treasury has provisi@@ onally calculated the measure of the tax on capital gains , but expects a final decision from Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 budget , has put a 7 % right of stamp for the properties costing more than £ 2 million and the annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually .
The right of tre@@ e already applies to the residential properties of the L@@ est@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ington &amp; C@@ el@@ sea distric@@ ts , and represents GBP 7@@ 08 million on the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-@@ East , north-@@ west and the Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and H@@ um@@ ber combined .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &apos; As a result of the increase in the right of tre@@ e on high-@@ value properties and the introduction of the anti-@@ avo@@ idance law in this area , it is very difficult to make progress that the valuable properties are under@@ tax@@ ed regardless of the effects of the outdated residential tax system . &apos;
“ But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the current owners who are reluctant to sell , ” he added .
Pri@@ vate housing – the 5 % to 10 % of the highest prices in the housing market – in the prosperous sector in the south-@@ west of London that is cr@@ ying from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ b@@ ed@@ on , increased by a record percentage of 11.@@ 8 % last year .
P@@ ric@@ es in the center of London are annual growth of 5.@@ 6 % per year , but have been over@@ shad@@ owed by a growing “ internal market ” , the south-@@ west of the city , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) , and the ( 6@@ .5 % ) , with a recovery , according to S@@ avo@@ s studies .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted how the movements of a dog ’ s qu@@ e@@ ue are linked to its mood .
Pre@@ vious studies had revealed that happy dogs won their qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while the nerv@@ ous dogs won the left more .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and respond to them .
Professor Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ gar@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ science at the University of T@@ ren@@ te , said : &apos; Everyone knows that , in man , the left side and the right of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimul@@ i that ar@@ ouse positive or negative emotions &apos; .
Here we have tried to see what is happening in other species .
He added that , as well as in humans , among dogs the right to the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and the two hemis@@ p@@ here played a different role in emotions .
To know more about how dogs respond to the dis@@ ordered qu@@ e@@ ue movements of other dogs , researchers have followed animals looking to films where other dogs were found .
They have measured the heart frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ue sometimes goes on one side and sometimes the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ gar@@ gar@@ a said : “ We have presented to dogs of films in which other dogs were found – or a nat@@ ur@@ alist version is a sil@@ ver to avoid any further cause of confusion – and we have been able to manipul@@ ate the qu@@ e@@ ue movement and present it to the left or the right . ”
When the animals saw a dog without an expression of the qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that was b@@ lowing the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , they remained perfectly rela@@ xed .
But when they pe@@ a@@ ked a qu@@ e@@ ue mainly to the left ( again from the point of view of the dog that b@@ ore the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , their heart frequency has accelerated , and they look un@@ easy .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ tin said that he did not think that the dogs were deliberately communic@@ ating with these movements .
Instead , he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet many other dogs on several occasions , and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their qu@@ e@@ ue to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side is playing a less friendly attitude , you will react to this experience . &apos;
Res@@ ear@@ chers indicate that the results could enable owners , ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arians , and d@@ augh@@ ters to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The B@@ ram@@ sh@@ a@@ w expert expert , a prof@@ essor of the B@@ ris@@ to@@ l University Scho@@ ol , made it clear that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the can@@ e .
Last year , a team of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a jo@@ y@@ ful dog .
And , in another scientific study carried out by Vic@@ tor@@ ia University in Canada , he said : “ The dogs went more easily to a ro@@ bo@@ t dog when his qu@@ e@@ ue won the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study . ”
He said that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully regard animals or ro@@ bo@@ t dogs as dogs .
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
“ Although there are many elements in different ma@@ m@@ m@@ als that indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception ’ , he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other .
Ar@@ k Mon@@ ke@@ ys
The Ar@@ ti@@ k Mon@@ ke@@ ys ro@@ ck group has postponed a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w after a lyn@@ ch has been diagno@@ sed with its sing@@ er .
The S@@ wi@@ ff@@ i@@ eld group was to take place on Friday in the H@@ y@@ dro@@ o concer@@ t in the town town .
However , his lyn@@ ch forced the sing@@ er Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner to re@@ programme the spectac@@ le .
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concer@@ t to the L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham on Thursday .
In a statement on their official site , the Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys said : “ Following the decision to postpone the concer@@ t to L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a from Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham this evening , and after asking for a medical opinion , the Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys must also postpone the spectac@@ le to the Hy@@ dro@@ o de G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w on Friday 1 November . ”
&quot; Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner suffers from a lyn@@ ch , and regrets that he cannot be in concer@@ t . &quot;
The spectac@@ le at L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham will take place on 20 November and the Hy@@ dro@@ o de G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w will be held on 21 November .

Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is
The Pope , Franc@@ is Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is , will appoint new Car@@ d@@ ing@@ es of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on Thursday .
Car@@ d@@ inal men are the highest church men in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect it , so Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will appoint his first group of men who ultimately choose his successor .
There are now 20@@ 1 Car@@ d@@ inal .
But , as soon as a car@@ din@@ al reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer take part in the election of a Pope – that is , a group of 120 “ car@@ din@@ ers ” .
In a statement announcing the new , Fa@@ ther F@@ eder@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ bar@@ di , a V@@ a@@ tic@@ an spokesman , said that a meeting of all the existing card@@ inal card@@ inal groups would take place before the ceremony in which b@@ ish@@ ops will be raised to the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as the con@@ is@@ ter@@ ate .
“ The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is decided to communicate his decision to conven@@ e the February cons@@ is@@ ture in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Car@@ d@@ inal Car@@ d@@ inal in different parts of the world , ” said Lom@@ bar@@ di .
J@@ ack V@@ al@@ er@@ o of Ca@@ thol@@ ics said that by February the number of voters will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many car@@ d@@ inal as he needed to ensure that the number of voters in the electorate had 120 and so many car@@ din@@ als over 80 years old .
The next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is in March of this year .
At the moment , there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe , especially Italy .
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint car@@ din@@ ers of the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he added .
For@@ ty per cent of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of car@@ din@@ ers represent them .
The car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is formed the Car@@ d@@ inal Council , a group of eight car@@ d@@ ing@@ es around the world to examine ways to reform the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided alone .
“ From now on , Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is chose these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him ” , explained V@@ alert .
He added that he was &apos; perfectly possible &apos; which Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is is asking for advice to the Car@@ d@@ inal .
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new .
V@@ al@@ er@@ o said that the po@@ pes were generally b@@ ish@@ ops representing large communities as a Car@@ d@@ inal , but Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is was “ full of sur@@ prises ” – so we do not know who he will appoint .
G@@ M rec@@ alls some of its new p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps in the US
General Mo@@ tors C@@ o is rec@@ alling almost 19 000 of his new Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ l@@ et Sil@@ ver@@ ado and G@@ M@@ C p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps in order to deal with a problem with the files of the US body responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps , the seats before could present a defec@@ t in the mechanism of inc@@ lin@@ ation .
As a result , the dossiers do not meet the federal safety standards of vehicles with regard to the e-@@ heads .
“ If the vehicle is per@@ me@@ ated by the back , it may be that the e-@@ heads do not adequately protect passengers , thereby increasing the risk of injuries , ” according to the declaration on the site of the National High@@ way Tra@@ ffic Administration ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) .
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of the G@@ M pi@@ p@@ ps started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and its restructuring in 2009 .
G@@ M informed the owners of the defec@@ t in the first half of October .
The N@@ H@@ T@@ SA was unable to examine the letter of information to the owners because of the 16 days ruling of government activities , which slow@@ ed the growth of vehicle sales in October .
The sales of Sil@@ ver@@ ado and Sierra Leone , which were re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , rose by about 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , declared G@@ M on Friday .
In October , G@@ M sold 42 6@@ 60 p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and 16 50@@ 3 p@@ ick@@ ol@@ ps .
G@@ M shares rose by 1.@@ 4 % to $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change Friday afternoon .
A worker dies in concrete blocks
A construction worker is being killed in dozens of concrete blocks , on Thursday the day before mid@@ day in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The tragedy occurred at 11 a.m. , on the Mar@@ qu@@ et@@ te street , near the inter@@ section of the Be@@ au@@ well street , in the Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La P@@ ess@@ er Patri@@ e .
In all likelihood , work on the foundations has been going on there for some time .
A b@@ rick wall of foundations had been built in the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim came to the site to recover its tools .
I was travelling by car , and I saw the wall collapse with a large smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en , said Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I am lan@@ ded and I have gone away from the big b@@ ric@@ ks that would be recovered .
There was only one part of his back , that is so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in 50 who worked for a co@@ ff@@ er company .
There has been room for re@@ anim@@ ation by emergency services , but without success .
He has not survived his serious injuries .
An inspec@@ tor of the Health and Safety Commission has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
Obama \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s T@@ ask of despair
I voted twice for President Obama .
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts to get through the Republican Party ’ s obstruc@@ tion@@ ism .
obstruc@@ tion@@ ism
The memory of Obama ’ s 2008
N@@ ath@@ i@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is student in the 2@@ n@@ d year of medicine in Har@@ v@@ ard medicine .
I am reading a very sad book in recent days .
It is a book which I thought would encourage me during the mor@@ ass of the second year of medicine and give me hope .
He is called “ The Aud@@ it@@ ty to W@@ in , ” and that is the memory of Barack Obama ’ s presidential campaign in 2008 .
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening , and I am now , this book brings me back to the time when policies were inspired by millions of people and speeches could break you out .
The election ended with an overwhelming victory , and the presen@@ tations of news newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des cry for joy and my parents retained all the newspapers they found .
A young vision@@ ary team went to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama ’ s transition period before he took office in 2008 , he had 82 % in favour .
Then I am closing the book .
Re@@ turning to the present is a difficult aw@@ ak@@ ening , it is like getting out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days of optimism , and they are like distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put Obama ’ s credit for great achievements , from the passage of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act to the departure of Iraq from our army , by the end of &quot; no &quot; or known , and the murder of Os@@ ama bin Laden .
Furthermore , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But , having repeatedly defended Obama ’ s administration against my pe@@ ers and my colleagues , I can no longer provide explanations .
I am on the ver@@ ge of political despair .
Republican ob@@ struction cannot explain foreign leaders , nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the privacy of the Americans , or the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers that reveal the mis@@ deeds of the government .
It cannot justify the murder of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , and the avo@@ idance of public funding and the over@@ sho@@ oting of permitted expenditure during the presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are &apos; more aggressive ... since the administration of Ni@@ xon &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the im@@ possibility of design@@ ing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I do not know whether that is what I expected .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .
Of course , the electoral function is not predictable , because the opposition political party and events that occur by chance , such as the massacre in New@@ ton , influence our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples I have listed seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what distur@@ bs me most .
I voted for Obama again in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a confused , un@@ refin@@ ed alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined .
I felt that Obama , who was elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections , would deliver the promises that have been made for so long .
Yet , while the fav@@ orable opinion index has plun@@ ged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I am not happy with the many promises that have been made .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses for Clinton to the Pri@@ ur@@ may@@ ies of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting , he told his team that they had to get back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause .
‘ I want us to focus on our talent ’ .
We must remember who we are .
We are now five years ago , Mr President , and I no longer agree with you .
The views expressed in this comment are only those of N@@ ath@@ i@@ el Mor@@ ris .
On Friday , at 3 p.m. , a violent col@@ lis@@ ion between a mo@@ to and a car took place on the street of Re@@ tin@@ ne in F@@ l@@ é@@ on .
The late , J@@ on@@ a@@ than , 26 years of F@@ l@@ é@@ on , was not a ca@@ p .
Despite rapid relief , he died during this fron@@ tal col@@ lis@@ ion .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims that Mr Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire Member C@@ live Pal@@ mer argues that Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his d@@ augh@@ ters could be pregnant and benefit from this system .
The ty@@ pe@@ -@@ mining ty@@ co@@ on , which con@@ tests the payment of a carbon tax of $ 6@@ M , has made this argument to try to remove questions about possible conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s girls were prepared to benefit personally from these policies .
&apos;@@ It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because , if one of its d@@ augh@@ ters is pregnant , it will have a direct interest in whether or not it ob@@ tains leave &apos; , said Mr Pal@@ mer .
Two months after his election , the Elec@@ toral Commission officially stated that Mr Pal@@ mer won the headquarters of Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast of F@@ ai@@ r@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes , after re@@ counting .
Mr Pal@@ mer has put forward the idea of res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling the voting system to speed up the process .
The girls of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , Fre@@ es and Bri@@ d@@ g@@ let .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished ?
“ We need a better system , ” he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your coordination in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6.@@ 30 p.m. the next morning ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of paper pen@@ s to score the ballot papers .
Is it in order to er@@ ase the result if someone does not agree ?
Today , having a paper paper seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has studied possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for the Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he would take his new functions &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The exercise of public functions is a public service issue .
&quot; We are not looking for rewards , except for the reward of history , because we must serve the community at a critical moment , &quot; he added .
A team of bi@@ olog@@ ists led by the Wil@@ d@@ life Conservative Society in New York identified a new species of d@@ au@@ ph@@ in in the north of Australia .
Th@@ ick@@ t B@@ au@@ ou@@ ou@@ x , responsible for the scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for the Conser@@ vation and Dis@@ ability of A@@ ni@@ ev@@ ills and Mi@@ locations Mar@@ ins ( O@@ C@@ EM@@ M@@ M ) , is for the Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Does the discovery of this new species of dol@@ ph@@ in to bo@@ ast surprise you ?
That is good news , but it does not surprise me particularly .
In the past , the species have been described and identified on mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ atomic and geographical basis , today , the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics enables us to improve our knowledge in science of species classification .
Moreover , it is not possible for these advances in genetic engineering and bi@@ ology to call into question the classification or belonging of a species of a kind , a family , or even an order .
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , mor@@ ph@@ ists classified animals , based on the mor@@ pho@@ logical differences between species .
Today , some of these ran@@ kings are called into question because of genetic progress .
Similarly , two species that are very close to mor@@ pho@@ logically have been distinguished by genetic engineering .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
A decade ago , the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-@@ family : the Pacific dol@@ ph@@ ins and wh@@ ales to the Atlantic .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is it an important discovery , as the Wil@@ d@@ life Conservative Society has said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and thus its genetic vari@@ ability .
If this population were already known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only there .
Therefore , if a massive mortality problem caused by a vir@@ al epidemic or acci@@ dental catch occurs in the region , we could be dealing with the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered according to the number of people on Earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it will recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to the species species of origin , the population of the new species discovered , its stock has automatically become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ gene@@ ous , open habitats , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This gene bre@@ wing limits the creation of new species .
By contrast , more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which can eventually create new species .
We must be aware that the marine environment is the least well known environment .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts to M@@ ars , to know what is going on in the Mari@@ ann@@ es so@@ se , only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea .
More money is being spent on living in other plan@@ ets than in marine research and it is high time that this changed .
R@@ B@@ S@@ s suspension
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign-@@ exchange division from two sources close to the dossier , which again shows that the global investigation of the suspicion of currency manipulation is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , such as U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators as part of the world ’ s largest financial market investigations , where $ 5.@@ 3 trillion is changing each day .
The two traders are the first employees of R@@ B@@ S to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation , which reflects the scandal of manipulation of the Li@@ b@@ or inter@@ bank rate .
The bank , which refused to comment on suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month receiving requests for information from regulators .
&apos;@@ The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we cooperate fully with the F@@ F@@ A and the other regulators &apos; , declared a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the dossier said that R@@ B@@ S had transmitted issues of em@@ ail and in@@ stant messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , the British regulator , the Financial Con@@ du@@ t Authority .
This tr@@ ick , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 , and would have been suspended from the post of European D@@ P@@ Morgan trading official at J@@ P@@ Morgan .
Ro@@ h@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , a European official trading officer in C@@ iti , was set aside this week , while Mat@@ t Gar@@ d@@ in@@ er , a senior currency tra@@ der in Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S , was suspended by Stand@@ ard Char@@ ter@@ ed this week .
None of these traders have been prosecuted .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s case included in@@ stant messages sent to and by bankers working at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ ti@@ group , added sources close to the dossier .
U@@ B@@ S explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , said that he was investigating suspic@@ ions of currency manipulation in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities – the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , Swiss competition authority Wa@@ k@@ o , the F@@ F , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – look at the allegations about bankers who have agreed to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ Morgan and Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators , have indicated sources close to the file .
The banks are looking at the in@@ stant messages and em@@ ail sent for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
The news about these investigations has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth in investment banks in recent years , but has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits the opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers tried to minim@@ ize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast liquid exchange market , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A senior tra@@ der said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “ explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost . ”
The news came on the very day that the C@@ re@@ said Switzerland announced that it sent a tra@@ der working in its fund office negotiated on the London Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change this week after it caused a loss of $ 6@@ M at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators .
‘ We are convinced that the tr@@ ick has acted alone and that the case has been controlled ’ , has indicated a representative of the C@@ re@@ said Switzerland .
The investigation of May@@ or R@@ b Ford
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Ro@@ b Ford smo@@ king on the pen@@ k , M@@ e C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by argued that he had never seen such a bot@@ ched investigation .
M@@ e Ru@@ by said that the police had “ ignored or minim@@ ised ” the evidence against the may@@ or .
On Thursday , the police arrested the occa@@ sional friend and driver of Ro@@ b Ford , Alexander Lis@@ i , aged 35 , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion with video .
Alexander Lis@@ i , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police have said that they have also observed this man who deli@@ vers a par@@ c@@ el to Ro@@ b Ford , indicating new court documents .
Mr Ru@@ by described the fact that the police never sear@@ ched the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford or his or her home , or that he was listening to his phone , arguing that the police chief Bill Blair was aware of the fact that he did not act against the may@@ or .
Under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands , could have inter@@ cep@@ ted the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford , arrest the may@@ or , and carry out a search - even without a mandate .
It could also have required an in@@ stant search mandate , if necessary .
The police chief has not commented , but his spokesman Mar@@ k P@@ u@@ waste has described the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by as &apos; obvious and desperate attempt &apos; to press the media in a case that is not in any way relevant .
In the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &apos; reasonable grounds &apos; that could lead to a criminal accusation against the may@@ or .
European Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change
With the exception of London , the major European stock markets are falling on Friday in the middle of the sitting , pl@@ agu@@ ed by some new companies with disappointing companies , while Wall@@ -@@ Street is expected to rise .
Moreover , investors remain cautious , because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could break down its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , after inflation announced at 0.7 % for the eurozone as a whole , the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street suggests that US actions should be opened up , after two con@@ secu@@ tive con@@ secu@@ tive sittings .
To the values , Rena@@ ult ( -@@ 4.@@ 63 % ) recorded the strongest re@@ bel@@ lion of CA@@ C 40 , pl@@ agu@@ ed by the warning of its partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor on Friday .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) marks the worst performance of Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 , having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a “ bad bank ” ( “ bad bank ” ) structure of $ 38 billion of the most risky assets .
For its part , V@@ od@@ af@@ ar ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) remains at the top of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 increases in reaction to press information that T@@ T &amp; T is considering a possible takeover bid .
In the exchange market , specul@@ ations about the evolution of the ECB &apos;s monetary policy are going well , as John Har@@ dy testi@@ fies , strate@@ g@@ ists in Sa@@ x@@ o Bank .
The ECB &apos;s unique mandate has always been on inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reason to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
We are anticip@@ ating a great potential for a reduction in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its re@@ treat against the US currency and has reached a lower of two weeks to $ 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 .
The same con@@ jec@@ ture supports the eurozone ’ s bond market .
Obama ’ s S@@ anc@@ t Court
The big victory for the Obama administration is that the US Supreme Court said today that Obama ’ s health-care reform law was constitutional .
By 5 votes against 4 , judges valid@@ ated the P@@ ati@@ ent Protection and Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ( law on the protection of patients and affordable care ) – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they have to pay a fine – and have said that it is constitutional under the government ’ s power of taxation .
The President of the Supreme Court , John Rob@@ er@@ ts , has joined the four most liberal members of the Court , while the judges S@@ c@@ lia , Thomas , A@@ li@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy have expressed their disagreement .
The Court also valid@@ ated the other sections of the law of 2 700 pages and , furthermore , considered that the provision of the health reform law , which states that the eligibility threshold for Medic@@ aid should be low@@ ered , otherwise it will lose all federal funding from the programme , was coer@@ cive in accordance with the constitution .
The procedure for blocking the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the first of 2012 , including the nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , are fier@@ cely opposed to the law .
The former combat@@ ants in M@@ end@@ on
At the heart of the gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard of the T@@ ra@@ b@@ ou@@ qu@@ et , civil , religious and military authorities , as well as many patri@@ otic associations , have , this Friday afternoon , paid tribute to the soldiers and de@@ func@@ t of all wars .
D@@ oub@@ ts have been lod@@ ged in two of the three military careers of the c@@ eme@@ tery by the May@@ or Jean-@@ Claude Gu@@ i@@ bal and various person@@ alities .
Agreement between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday 31 October 2013 in a violent c@@ up on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday 1 November after the deple@@ tion of its fuel stocks announced the Palestinian Energy Authority .
A local comm@@ ander of the E@@ zz@@ e@@ dia al-@@ Q@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ g@@ ades , K@@ hal@@ ed Ab@@ ou B@@ ak@@ or , and another framework of the Hamas armed branch , R@@ abi@@ e@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a sh@@ ell sh@@ ell in an Israeli army incur@@ sion into the east of K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ n@@ ès , in the south of Gaza , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials of the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ass@@ am Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ ass@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ ou@@ d , died when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
The Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli cha@@ s@@ m and a bl@@ und@@ er bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er have caused an incur@@ sion into a hundred metres within the territory before then withdrawing .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , a Hamas spokes@@ person , S@@ am@@ i Abu Z@@ ou@@ h@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &apos; her@@ oes &apos; and said that Israeli soldiers had died in confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ass@@ am who have fallen by defending the territory in an incur@@ sion of Z@@ an Y@@ ou@@ n@@ ès occup@@ ations into K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ n@@ ès .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;@@ Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &apos; , threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel in Israeli territory since the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , which was discovered on 7 October and , according to the army , to &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed the use of tun@@ n@@ els to fight Israel , specifying that the aim was to abduc@@ t Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communi@@ qu@@ é .
In the course of the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive en@@ sla@@ vement aimed at the forces of T@@ as@@ h@@ al ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israel in northern Syria
&apos;@@ This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians &apos; , also indicated the spokesman of the Peter L@@ er@@ ner army .
On the other hand , Israel has struck an air military base in north-@@ west Syria , aimed at a missile cargo for the Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement Hezbollah , reported on Thursday 31 October the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite channel .
An American official confirmed an &apos; Israeli strike &apos; but did not give details of the target .
“ In the past , the targets were missiles transferred to H@@ iz@@ bollah , ” was it just added .
Israeli officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
Among the &apos; exclusive sources &apos; that she has not appointed , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that &apos; the bombing has targeted a cargo of solar missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon &apos; , in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces .
Ear@@ lier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory , reported on a number of explo@@ sions heard on Wednesday at the d@@ aw@@ n in an air defence base at S@@ on@@ ar J@@ ab@@ é , near L@@ attacked , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation based on a network of milit@@ ants and medical sources was unable to identify the origin of the explo@@ sions .
In black and white for Mari@@ e Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , who is presenting to Dan@@ se Dan@@ se the two new group char@@ ge@@ rap@@ ies : the first inspired by Hen@@ ri Mic@@ hel@@ le ’ s en@@ c@@ endants and po@@ ems , the second in@@ sti@@ lled by the famous so@@ cc@@ ano G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ oper@@ es ’ famous so@@ lo@@ s .
One evening that makes it possible to see all the pr@@ ism of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , art in wh@@ ites and black white .
A white scre@@ en serves as a fundamental wall .
On the car@@ pet , which is so white , in the huge area of The@@ at@@ ri@@ bel@@ t , is moving , profile and end like a line and clo@@ thes of black , a body .
On the scre@@ en , a ink of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ hel@@ le is planned .
The body , simple , takes its form .
This form will be that of the whole coin : a bo@@ y of physical im@@ itation of design@@ s .
The d@@ an@@ s@@ ers , fully clo@@ th@@ ed in black , only their hands and face face , are waiting on each side of the game , are rush@@ ing when the next round appears , embo@@ dies , they are coming out .
The black and white game of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ hel@@ es is being played out by so@@ lo@@ s , in un@@ ison ( a mass that is sol@@ o ) , in large group of twelve so@@ lo@@ s where everyone is performing his sign .
We are thinking of &apos; G@@ l@@ ory de morning &apos; , where , in sol@@ o , Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard carried out a series of ch@@ or@@ est@@ ish tasks written on car@@ t@@ els , put online .
This is the same principle , a giant P@@ ow@@ er@@ Po@@ int .
Here music is strong , per@@ me@@ ated and electrical .
Energy is high , always fast .
There will be a cast@@ e when Car@@ ol Pri@@ or will take refuge under the d@@ ance car@@ pet , to deliver , micro@@ phone in hand , without so@@ ber@@ ing or restraint , a share of the po@@ em of Mic@@ hel@@ le , Mon@@ c@@ or@@ de , and mon@@ ot@@ one in the cri@@ tic , and will continue by d@@ an@@ cing .
And the music music and the sequ@@ ence to resume .
This sound and energe@@ tic discharge , long , if it is possible , ends up attacking and sin@@ king .
As is the regul@@ arity of the visual pace .
There are a few fine fl@@ ash@@ points - the creation of images has always been a force in Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard - such as those ha@@ ir f@@ lowing or these black tissu@@ es that extend the lines .
But the cha@@ g@@ gy approach lacks composition .
We have the impression that the ch@@ or@@ us , instead of going to the Mic@@ hel@@ le meeting , has been forced to do so .
As a result , the bodies appear to be at the mercy of draw@@ ings .
The h@@ ats of Mic@@ hel@@ le , like G@@ es@@ tal@@ t forms , are opening up a broader and gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic imag@@ inary than d@@ an@@ cing , more por@@ ous .
Only the end , in negative terms , with its d@@ an@@ cing d@@ an@@ s@@ ers ha@@ s@@ n with a str@@ ob@@ o@@ op@@ ic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theat@@ re , is h@@ itting the magic .
The public loved , the reception was warm .
The G@@ y@@ m@@ ne@@ works , after the en@@ act , is richer .
The scene is partly mu@@ ted , d@@ ans@@ ts and pi@@ ano are covered by tissu@@ es , like fur@@ nit@@ ure in a neglected house .
In the pi@@ ano , d@@ ans@@ s@@ ers stood for the party .
Their un@@ tou@@ cha@@ bles in music , tou@@ ching , give real frag@@ ility .
On the scene , the couples , in lo@@ ath@@ some lo@@ ads , very sen@@ sel@@ ess , even ero@@ ded couples .
Working groups , small so@@ lo@@ s of transi@@ tions , which are moving , shocking , writing is less bin@@ ary .
There are bu@@ ff@@ ers , also familiar with Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , with the red no@@ se , with highly pol@@ ari@@ zed men and women .
The am@@ bears are car@@ n@@ as@@ ers , fleeing or players .
C@@ he@@ ap , ri@@ es , and s@@ cri@@ es are virtually the ar@@ cha@@ ic , gr@@ an@@ di@@ ose , and lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous body of co@@ o@@ ked bodies .
But the coin is taking its real flight after the sal@@ vation .
A c@@ lown is on the scene when the public leaves .
Here , everything is being allowed : the fourth wall falls , the uni@@ verse is super@@ se@@ ded , the d@@ orm@@ ant d@@ wel@@ lers , des@@ c@@ end among the spec@@ t@@ ators , g@@ los@@ sy , smo@@ ther , f@@ ade , play applause , play the br@@ unt of a sav@@ ag@@ ely calculated mess .

Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g and Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i
The group with thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents has begun an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of legal proceedings in the field of patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that it ha@@ ir@@ ly ho@@ o@@ ked at the auc@@ tion of patents that took place after the collapse of Nor@@ tel .
Ro@@ c@@ k@@ star , the cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um that acquired Nor@@ tel patents for $ 4@@ .5 trillion , lod@@ ged a complaint against Sam@@ sun@@ g Elec@@ tr@@ tr@@ ics C@@ o L@@ t@@ d , H@@ T@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and four other companies for a patent breach before the US Court of Justice in T@@ ex@@ as .
Ro@@ k@@ star is held jointly by Ap@@ ple , Micro@@ soft , Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , E@@ ric@@ sson and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of violating seven patents .
Pat@@ ents contain technologies that allow advertising in connection with Internet research terms , have indicated the conclusions of the trial , which is the heart of Google ’ s work .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ k@@ star .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and H@@ T@@ C make tele@@ phones operating under Google ’ s An@@ dro@@ de operating system , which has fierce competition with Ap@@ ple and Micro@@ soft products .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of $ 900 million for Nor@@ tel patents .
Google has increased its offer on several occasions , finally proposing $ 4.@@ 4 .
After losing Nor@@ tel patents in the face of Ro@@ k@@ star , Google won Mo@@ tor@@ ola Mo@@ i@@ lit@@ y for $ 12@@ .5 trillion , a market based on Mo@@ tor@@ ola ’ s patent libr@@ ary .
“ Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at auc@@ tion , Google violated and continues to violate the patents , ” indicated the trial ’ s conclusions .
Ro@@ c@@ k@@ star calls for greater damage and interest against Google , because it claims that Google ’ s patent violation is stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly stub@@ born , according to the complain@@ ant .
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ itation of a house in G@@ es@@ ves
The grand@@ mother would have opened a cigarette in a gas le@@ ak .
The explosion of a housing in G@@ es@@ ve , which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning , a grand@@ mother of 52 and her 5@@ -year grand@@ son , is due to a gas le@@ ak from a defec@@ tive water driver , indicated on Friday evening the replacement of the King of the King .
The expert sent out by the public prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely acci@@ dental .
The grand@@ mother lit a cigarette when there was a flight and an accumulation of gas .
The vital prog@@ no@@ sis of the two victims is still committed .
The grand@@ mother was projected by the explosion and is being bur@@ nt down .
The small bo@@ y who was in his grand@@ father and his compan@@ ion was on his side and was bur@@ nt slightly .
&quot; The two victims were in@@ und@@ ated and at long last condi@@ tioned on the ground before being taken over to the Li@@ è@@ ge of Li@@ è@@ ge , which was in the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , in am@@ bul@@ ance , &quot; made the qu@@ ag@@ mire José Paul@@ et , des@@ cen@@ ded at the scene .
The grand@@ father was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
S@@ ain and except , he was able to join the floor by the st@@ ap@@ le that remained intact , while the re@@ treat from the house was completely destroyed .
The grand@@ father and the ten@@ ants of the neighbouring house , who are weakened by the explosion , have been rela@@ xed by the President of the CA@@ P@@ AS .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade in An@@ ne and N@@ am@@ ur and the Ar@@ ts police have intervened .
The civil protection of Cris@@ na has stabil@@ ised both buildings .
Egypt ’ s first freely elected president
Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si has l@@ ent the inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political disputes in Egypt .
The Islamist Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si promised the emergence of a “ new Egypt ” when he l@@ ent his inaug@@ ur@@ ation to the presidency , thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier .
In his inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture before the Constitutional Court , Mr Mor@@ si also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State in Egypt since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ archy 60 years ago .
He was s@@ wor@@ n in front of the 18 judges on the black ro@@ ck of the Court whose building on the N@@ il was built to look like an Egyptian temp@@ le .
“ We want a better future , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , ” said President Mor@@ si during the formal ceremony broadcast directly on public television .
“ Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” explained Mr Mor@@ si , a 6@@ 0-@@ year-old engine@@ er in the United States , coming from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal and hard-@@ pressed organization of successive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and polic@@ emen kept the building when Mr Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11 hours , a local hour , followed by a small con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred f@@ ans had gathered before the Court to acc@@ laim the new president and , moving away from the President of Mubarak &apos;s presidency , the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his con@@ voy on the very crow@@ ded streets connec@@ ting the cen@@ tre@@ -@@ town to the south .
In view of the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ rescue wheel ” , its personal prestige has increased considerably since its victory and its Friday speech in which it tried to present itself as the candidate not only of the Islamists , but of all those who want to end the work begun during the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak .
“ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” declared Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , in blue and white co@@ stu@@ me , to the judges in the h@@ all@@ mark of b@@ ick@@ ery in which he l@@ ent o@@ ath .
Lat@@ er , Mr Mor@@ si visited the Cairo University in which he gave his inaug@@ ur@@ ation speech .
He was officially welcomed by a military fan@@ fare who played the national an@@ them when he was standing in the gar@@ den .
The Ma@@ re@@ ch@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ yes attended the ceremony .
When he arrived , he was gre@@ eted by the &apos; people and the army , hand in hand ... &apos; , en@@ gen@@ dered by thousands of people gathered in the great hi@@ re of university .
Based on 19@@ 08 and the former bas@@ tion of secular education , Cairo ’ s university became a str@@ anger of Islamist student groups in the 1970 ’ s .
Mr Mor@@ si made a symbolic ser@@ ver on Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square , where the uprising that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian regime last year , and v@@ owed to recover the presidential powers whose military council , which replaced the former president , has stri@@ pped him .
But , by agreeing to formally lend to the Court , rather than to Parliament as it is used , he is inc@@ iting the military ’ s will by showing that the power struggle is not over .
Mr Mor@@ si ’ s speech in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square accompanied spectacular populist gest@@ ures .
The US S@@ hu@@ t@@ down
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weigh@@ ed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October , showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers , five of the six most important performing performance performance .
The three major De@@ tro@@ it manufacturers are growing at two figures compared with October 2012 , but only General Mo@@ tors has done better than expected .
An@@ aly@@ sts anticipated an average of 15@@ .@@ 4 million sales at an ann@@ u@@ alized rate and corrected seasonal variations , but the market was at 15@@ .@@ 3 million according to the estimates of Adam J@@ on@@ as , Morgan Stan@@ ley .
In a note to the bank &apos;s customers , he believes that this slight bra@@ ke is primarily due to &apos; the government sh@@ ut@@ down and its impact on the consumer &apos;s sense of feeling in the first half of the month &apos; .
Nevertheless , G@@ M has reported that it is about 16 % of its sales last month to 2@@ 26 4@@ 02 vehicles , compared to 2@@ 11 5@@ 63 , expected by consensus .
The four bran@@ ds of the group have seen their commercial performance improved compared with October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit from the success of its p@@ ick@@ -@@ ups , has seen its sales increase by 14 % over a year to 19@@ 1 9@@ 85 vehicles , while the consensus expected 19@@ 4 30@@ 1 .
For its part , Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ler , controlled by Fi@@ at , announced an 11 % increase in sales to 140 0@@ 83 vehicles , compared to 14@@ 3 5@@ 36 .
To@@ y@@ ot@@ a and N@@ iss@@ an also have lower sales , despite increases over a year of 8.@@ 8 % and 14@@ .@@ 2 % respectively .
At the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change , G@@ M action was 1.@@ 4 % at 16@@ .@@ 35 G@@ M@@ T , while Ford gave up 1.@@ 1 % .
Rena@@ ult
Rena@@ ult acc@@ uses Friday of the strongest drop in the S@@ B@@ F 120 index in Paris after its partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor announced that he had reduced his annual net profit forecast by almost 20 % , reporting traders .
N@@ iss@@ an , who had to carry out such a review , also announced a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of his direction .
Several traders reported that the Rena@@ ult action was affected this morning by &apos; learning &apos; .
&apos;@@ This is clearly the wa@@ ke-up call of N@@ iss@@ an &apos; , says a head of the tra@@ der of a Paris bro@@ ker .
Under the Rena@@ ult N@@ iss@@ an alliance , Rena@@ ult holds 4@@ 3.@@ 4 % of N@@ iss@@ an capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15 % of French , according to the N@@ iss@@ an website .
Greece
Two people were killed and another was injured on Friday evening by the fire fired by two people who were on the ver@@ ge of a mo@@ to who went to a local leader of the neo-@@ Nazi Gol@@ den D@@ aw@@ n in the West sub@@ ur@@ bs of Athens , have learned from police sources .
The police were not at present in a position to give information about the identity of the victims and their possible political aff@@ ili@@ ation .
Some Greek media reported that members of Au@@ be D@@ aw@@ n had argued that the victims were local guards .
The injured person immediately became hosp@@ it@@ alised , according to the same source .
polic@@ emen of the anti-@@ terrorist service have been sent out on the central aven@@ ue of the Dutch sub@@ ur@@ b of Iraq , where the incident took place and closed the area .
The incident comes a few weeks after the indic@@ tment of six de Au@@ be D@@ aw@@ n , including the leader and foun@@ der of the party , for participation in &apos; a criminal organisation &apos; in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-@@ fascist mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an by one of its members .
Scot@@ t Brown ’ s rejected
Mr Brown , the cap@@ tain of C@@ el@@ ti@@ c G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w , has seen his rejected call and will be suspended for the next two matches of League Cha@@ irs of his club , against A@@ j@@ a@@ x and A@@ C Mil@@ an .
Ex@@ am@@ ed against the Bar@@ ç@@ a for a blow to N@@ y@@ mar , the Scottish environment has seen its suspension extended to three meetings by U@@ EF@@ A .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , his club said &apos; very disappointed &apos; , believing that his appeal was entirely justified .
Ne@@ arly 50 000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province , shortly after mid@@ day on Friday , due to the violent win@@ ds affecting many regions along the St L@@ au@@ rent river .
The most affected sectors are the L@@ au@@ ren@@ tin , with 15 0@@ 42 subscri@@ bers in the black , the Mon@@ te@@ re@@ au@@ x with 13 4@@ 64 and the U@@ igh@@ ur with 8@@ 6@@ 42 .
The great region of Mon@@ tre@@ al also has a lot of b@@ ann@@ ers with almost 7@@ ,000 private homes in the me@@ tro@@ pol@@ is and L@@ av@@ al .
You thought that the travel agencies were in the past because of the Internet ?
It seems to be a reversal of the trend .
Society has revised its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results through ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying profit on the whole of the year between $ 3@@ 25 and $ 3@@ 40 million before taxes , compared to a previous forecast of 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 .
If current forecasts are reached , it will represent 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record profits of 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 M in 2011 / 12 .
The Director-General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ light Centre had achieved 8 % of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly with regard to travel other than business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom .
“ Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are well on the way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before deduc@@ ting interest and taxes , ” he said .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits .
In Australia , the rec@@ rea@@ tional travel sector has re@@ kin@@ d@@ led during the second half of the year , which has made it possible to compensate for a ligh@@ t-@@ touch domestic trade market .
Similarly in the United Kingdom , the F@@ light Centre travel sector in F@@ light Centre has produced good results , while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States has recovered its losses in the first half of the year , when seasonal demand is lower and should benefit from the entire financial year for the third time running .
The F@@ light Centre ’ s actions rose by 3 c@@ ents to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
There is an unknown ho@@ tel of the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid .
T@@ yp@@ ical un@@ known in@@ voices opened the fire this Friday on a ho@@ tel close to the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid in Egypt without victims , as a result of an apparent dispute with redundant workers .
The assa@@ il@@ ants took flight , made the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , the Police General Ab@@ del L@@ ative , clear .
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has been receiving almost no tourist ever since the army de@@ posed Islamist President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si in early July and re@@ pres@@ ses the protests of his supporters in blood .
Scho@@ ols
Within the framework of English literature , pupils will have to study at least one piece of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic po@@ em and a contemporary British fic@@ tion work of 19@@ 14 .
The examination will also present &apos; new texts &apos; to encourage a more diverse reading .
A combination of literature and English language will be abolished .
From 2015 , pupils will have to pass an independent G@@ C@@ SE , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education will have to publish its new English and male programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the regulator of exam@@ inations , will reveal a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of the structure of the G@@ C@@ SE , with a new rating system and less courses .
Speaking during the summer , Mic@@ hael Go@@ ve , Minister of Education , said that there was a “ broad consensus on the need to reform our system of exam@@ inations to restore public confidence , ” insisting that the CS@@ C would be “ more stimulating , more ambitious , and more rigorous . ”
Stu@@ dies show that English schools spend less time on m@@ th@@ s ( 1@@ 16 hours per year , 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
By comparison , Austr@@ ali@@ an schools offer an average of 14@@ 3 hours per year , and Singapore students make about 13@@ 8 hours .
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to m@@ th@@ s , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the G@@ C@@ SE of deep m@@ th@@ s – as well as greater emphasis on matters in international ran@@ kings – would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours .
The programme will focus more on “ real world problems , ” including financial mathema@@ tics .
This judgment means that a legal text adopted in July in that state , and in full question of the right to abortion , will be able to enter into force .
A oc@@ to@@ gen@@ aire ho@@ sts children with a gun to the M@@ ary for H@@ all@@ we@@ en
minors aged between 9 and 13 were wearing the door to call for good bonds on H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
One of the residents of the M@@ ay district visited by the children opened the door by holding its hunting gun .
The old man , aged 86 , explained to the police that he had been afraid of .
His weapon was seized .
The former G@@ est@@ ap@@ o leader buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery
Mü@@ ller , who disappeared at the end of the Second World War and never found his trace , was in fact buried in a common mass gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard of a Berlin Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery , affir@@ ms the leader of the M@@ em@@ orial of German Res@@ istance , Professor Johann@@ es T@@ uch@@ el , in Bil@@ d .
Mü@@ ller did not survive the end of the war .
&apos;@@ His body was buried in 1945 in a joint mass gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard of Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Mit@@ te &apos;s Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery &apos; , he assured every day of great ra@@ b@@ ies on the basis of archi@@ ve documents .
This re@@ vel@@ ation , 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler , would respond to one of the great en@@ ig@@ ma of the post-@@ War War .
The German secret services , the B@@ N@@ D , ensured that in the summer of 19@@ 49 Mü@@ ller was in Kar@@ lo@@ v@@ y V@@ ary , in Cz@@ echo@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ akia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
The secret services were completely wrong .
“ From August 1945 , Mü@@ ller ’ s body was found in a provisional grave near the former Ministry of the Re@@ ich of the Re@@ ich by a comm@@ ander , according to Mr T@@ uch@@ el .
It was &apos; a uniform uniform &apos; .
“ In the left of the left , among other things , there was a pho@@ to . ”
Bil@@ d also publ@@ ishes a document from the ma@@ id@@ en of the district of Mit@@ te in Berlin that he was buried in the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in the neighbourhood .
The President of the Central Council of Germany , Di@@ e@@ ter G@@ au@@ mann , declared himself shocked by this re@@ vel@@ ation .
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sad@@ ists is buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery is a huge amount of bad taste .
&quot; The memory of the victims is g@@ ros@@ sly crow@@ ded , &quot; has been res@@ cu@@ ed in the newspaper .
He@@ in@@ rich Mü@@ ller is among the important figures of the Third Re@@ ich who have never been caught .
He took part in the W@@ ann@@ se@@ e conference in January 19@@ 42 , which decided on the &apos; final solution &apos; and , in particular , led under his orders Ad@@ ol@@ f E@@ ich@@ mann , responsible for the &apos; logistics &apos; of the ex@@ termination of Jews , sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 196@@ 2 .

D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le
D@@ r@@ . B@@ ow@@ le and his team
There are not many doctors in this West African country , just 1 for 5 000 inhabitants .
Vo@@ te here or through your mobile machinery
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le is one of the 10 C@@ N@@ N of the year 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the 10 other her@@ o her@@ oes , to elect “ H@@ ann@@ os C@@ N@@ N of the year . ”
That person will receive $ 25@@ 0@@ ,000 in order to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le watched her sick father alter@@ n@@ ating periods of conscience and conscience and travelling to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James B@@ w@@ le was injured in a car crash in 198@@ 1 near Y@@ a@@ ou@@ n@@ é , the capital of Cam@@ ero@@ on .
At the beginning , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted a infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ em@@ at@@ om@@ y that he was going to carry the rest of his life .
“ There was no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on in Cam@@ ero@@ on , ” said Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le .
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money .
Instead , D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ le spent years accompanying his father in crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , so that he ob@@ tains any treatment he could benefit from .
‘ It is not easy ’ , adding Mr B@@ w@@ le .
You can leave the house at 5 : you are going to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they are waiting for too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr B@@ w@@ le &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there are only 1 doctors for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By comparison , the ratio in the United States is 1 doctors for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
Even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ on could not pay for consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three-@@ quarters of the country &apos;s health expenditure is carried out in the private sector .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty , &quot; explained Dr B@@ w@@ le .
Because of poverty , they cannot enjoy life .
Having seen his father and many of his comp@@ at@@ riots suffer , Dr B@@ w@@ le was determined to try to change things .
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le and his team of volunteers carried out more than 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the past year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar sur@@ ge@@ on at the central hospital in Y@@ a@@ ou@@ d@@ é .
And it created a non-@@ profit@@ -making humanitarian association , SA@@ CO@@ V@@ E , which goes to rural areas during week@@ ends to provide free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped almost 32 000 people .
Ne@@ arly all Fri@@ days , with 30 people , are mar@@ ching into pe@@ t@@ les after setting medical equipment on the ro@@ of and going through difficult land to go to villages that need help most .
The chance does not always follow .
They have often had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or empty ways .
But when they arrive , they are received as her@@ oes : the community is holding a f@@ es@@ ti@@ val , ch@@ ant , and d@@ an@@ cing and offering them the best available housing .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ le – with his great s@@ mile and d@@ ried energy – is more than happy to join the f@@ es@@ tivities .
The next morning , the team starts receiving hundreds of patients .
‘ We get 500 people on each visit ’ , said Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
Sometimes they live at 60 km of the village , and they come to foot .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is provided .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive cru@@ t@@ ches , l@@ un@@ ches collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
On the evening , the practical team of simple sur@@ gical acts under local an@@ a@@ es@@ thetic .
The operations are generally carried out in a school , a ma@@ id@@ en or a house ; after the intervention , the patient is standing up and travelling to the aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the Elec@@ tro@@ le Group , the operation room and the ster@@ il@@ isation of equipment , Dr B@@ w@@ le and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
It is a r@@ hy@@ th@@ m r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , but village mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans usually help the team to remain motivated .
&apos;@@ They are kno@@ cking on bu@@ ff@@ ers every night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work &apos; , explained Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
On Sunday the team returns to city , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , made up of Cam@@ ero@@ on doctors and medical students , carried out 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the last year , and it knows that their presence can make the difference for those who are helping them .
A man has explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a her@@ d would allow him to work again .
&apos;@@ This will change my future and that of my family &apos; .
In addition to having this mobile hospital living and working like sur@@ ger@@ y in hospital , Dr B@@ w@@ le is also working night in private medical firms around Y@@ a@@ ou@@ d@@ é .
It is this second job , it says , which finances 60 % of its association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
“ I don ’ t know when he sle@@ ep , ” he said , K@@ are@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a medical student in the second year of D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a and volunte@@ er within the D@@ r@@ it B@@ ow@@ le group .
It is still in hospital or in the process of trying to find money for its association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
For medical students and nurses like the United States and Europe who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr B@@ ow@@ le in his missions , it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home .
“ We have been able to take part in operations to help raise blood or pass the instruments to Dr B@@ w@@ le , ” explained M@@ iss O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
That is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine in the second year .
Volun@@ tary students generally pay their journey to Cam@@ ero@@ on , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
But once in Y@@ a@@ ound@@ é , their pensions , transportation , and education are borne by Dr B@@ ow@@ le .
“ It is a her@@ o , there is no doubt ” , said K@@ are@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for that association , and his desire to help the people of Cam@@ ero@@ on is not close to extinc@@ tion .
For Dr B@@ w@@ le , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ ping others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy .
‘ I am so happy when I do this work ’ added Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
Making people lau@@ gh and reli@@ eving pain is the reason that leads me to do that .
Take the SA@@ CO@@ V@@ E site to see how you can help .
Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a
The aca@@ demics have long pain@@ ted to define and place Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a .
Professor in amp@@ hi@@ res and in the courts of course ?
Without doubt , but by under@@ lining its weakness for the roads , S@@ ci@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , the U@@ tu@@ des of St@@ ud@@ es .
Ar@@ ound the works of others in his office in the G@@ as@@ ton@@ -@@ G@@ alli@@ mar@@ d street ?
Indeed , while ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publ@@ ish@@ er .
H@@ er@@ ry at the hel@@ m of the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t should not replace the real ho@@ ly oil , that of the theory , which has happened .
They have will@@ ingly acknowledged in him a great , anim@@ ator and feder@@ ator of their work , but that he has been unwilling to produce it himself .
To this uncertain image , the monu@@ ment of the “ Li@@ ve memory ” , to which he attached his name , also contributed .
The bad languages have been able to see it as a huge market for chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with a vi@@ br@@ ant eye and le@@ u@@ di@@ tion , but it is incur@@ ring .
The two works published by Nor@@ a nearly two years ago have already established that the person who was going for not writing had many and well written .
The book that is now to be brought to justice should be brought to justice .
Once again , however , there is the temptation of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , of the intellectual v@@ ag@@ mire , of the ju@@ bil@@ ation that has been placed on the side@@ lines of one subject .
But it is quickly understood that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered in this book in such a fine title will bring the ro@@ ck@@ y to a single passion : to discover the no@@ d of French identity .
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity ?
I@@ d@@ entity : this is a concern of time .
We have been collectively invited to give a definition .
But , in the per@@ va@@ sive spirit of our then leaders , French identity was a in@@ tim@@ ate essence .
Ac@@ ci@@ dents should only be deployed , and the case , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism , has been forced upon the pre@@ fec@@ ts and the sub@@ pre@@ ts , authorised interpreters .
There is no other way to go .
It is not a he@@ ir to e@@ ternal blin@@ dness , it is refusing to define it .
An@@ aly@@ sts concerned about a familiar str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he is in a forest of symbols , arrested at every step by a form of re@@ bus , tor@@ mented by irrit@@ ating issues .
Who is born of the company itself : why , in a country which has been so permanently inst@@ alled in its borders , which was previously char@@ tered and firmly established , will these dramatic calls for unity be heard ?
They are not so pressing , suggesting Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , to con@@ j@@ ure up the disorder caused by the dis@@ cor@@ d of French history .
Fran@@ cs and G@@ au@@ laws , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ac@@ is and Bour@@ gu@@ ign@@ ons , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the forces of division here are very old .
The most emb@@ le@@ matic of these is , of course , the one that breaks down national history .
From the earthquake , the French have two stories , and they have two nations , one mon@@ arch@@ ic , the other revolutionary .
The second was the death of the first , but it did not succeed in denying it ; instead , it was concerned about the fact that it would be sac@@ red and that it was all the more gre@@ edy of unity and indi@@ visibility that it had cut its head in the face of the obvious and powerful inc@@ ar@@ nation .
And , from here , a nation inv@@ inci@@ ably bin@@ ary , shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ation and hatred of the revolution .
In order to make this peculi@@ arity of French identity , nothing is worth the four steps out of the H@@ exagger@@ one , so that Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a may be the heart of his book .
Because America and France have both made a revolution , drafted a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
But the American c@@ ap@@ ing does more to highlight what is of our own .
There , the men who had left their An@@ ci@@ en Region in England and who no longer care about it .
Here , the crow@@ ded men of an indigenous , indigenous and indigenous An@@ ci@@ en are all the more radical .
This is a consensu@@ al revolution when it s@@ owed the drama and trust .
Here , the founding fathers who are still hon@@ ored , and here revolutionary anc@@ estors , whose models are hardly being developed , and who have been killed .
This is an institutional con@@ stan@@ cy , and here a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitutions , as many mistakes to be made and trials to be resumed .
France , France ,
There was , however , a time when the French believed that they could rec@@ ou@@ p the te@@ eth of their history and overcome the cur@@ se of the figure two .
In the Third Republic , which is central and creative , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a has shown great interest and even ten@@ ure : sal@@ u@@ ting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching the school@@ children of everything in the former France , obs@@ cu@@ red by modern France , and offering them a unified version of their history .
However , this peaceful identity had only a time .
Once again , this is in the debate , driven by immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of res@@ on@@ ative minorities , absor@@ bed in the European area .
The book therefore offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ it of France that is going and the cautious outline of France that has come .
With a premium , the portra@@ it of the histor@@ ian , which should reserve some sur@@ prises .
It is discovered that the shir@@ t was a ca@@ p .
The man of the multiple cu@@ o@@ si@@ ties was , rather obs@@ essive , around the same idea .
The man@@ ure of man@@ ure was at the centre of the centre .
And the person who , over a half-@@ century ago , tabled a subject on the idea of a nation , but had taken away from the original exercise of the theory , we are entr@@ u@@ sting ourselves , cu@@ m gr@@ ano s@@ ali@@ m , which he will have done .
Of course , in a less mature , fragmented and sub@@ tle form .
But let us not dec@@ eive ourselves , just as binding .
For much more than the figure imposed on the university curricul@@ um , this is a matter of the internal need for a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &apos; Re@@ turn is quite complex to manage &apos; .
En@@ lifted in Be@@ ir@@ ut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; team to fil@@ ter a H@@ iz@@ bollah demonstration , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987 .
Re@@ treaty since 2008 , in 2004 , he took part in the creation of the so-called &apos; World Law for the hostages &apos; , which he has presid@@ ed over for several years .
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages of A@@ q@@ m@@ i ( al-@@ Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) Dan@@ i@@ el L@@ ar@@ be , Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry D@@ ol , Pi@@ er@@ re Le@@ ga and Mar@@ c Fr@@ é@@ et were released on Tuesday .
After medical exam@@ inations at the V@@ al-@@ bri@@ de military hospital on Wednesday afternoon , they have been able to return to their families since then .
And gradually try to take up the course of their lives .
&apos;@@ The New Ob@@ ser@@ ver &apos; questioned Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ di@@ in , 62 years old , which was , since 2008 , the President of the &apos; World O@@ ffic@@ es of the World &apos; .
From the evening of your release you were on the 20@@ th of &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
Particularly in Be@@ ir@@ ut .
When I am released I find myself in the co@@ ff@@ er of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ ca .
He tells me &apos; we are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and I say that we can still be killed .
We are very exc@@ ited , but also very tense .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They are putting us on the board .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then we come to the Su@@ m@@ mer@@ land ho@@ tel site where the press is present .
The French are leading us to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
It is time for the first cou@@ ps to parents , the family , friends , the press ...
I remember I took a b@@ ath for an hour .
And having din@@ ned to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
I also remember a short night to discuss with Ro@@ ger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
The tension is still there because we have no means to evac@@ u@@ ate ourselves to the airport in Lar@@ na@@ ac@@ a in Cyprus .
With the hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter there is a private plane that brings us back to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ en@@ z@@ ara , where P@@ as@@ qua is concerned .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
We are getting to Or@@ l@@ y .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
That is a bit brutal .
There is an incredible s@@ cra@@ p .
And many media .
When I left there were three television channels .
I have come back and there is full .
The des@@ cent from the flight to the plane , the re@@ ins with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely emotional .
Between the airport and in my home , many motor@@ cycles follow our car which R@@ cus@@ cus@@ s leads .
The motor@@ ists are getting the qu@@ arre@@ l to make photo@@ s and go to my home where I have to do a little bit to prevent some of them from going .
The media pressure is enormous .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fa@@ ti@@ gue is such that it is difficult to see it .
We are going out of a hole and we are suddenly in the media .
It is rather complicated , somewhat violent , rather complex to manage .
But we have done the hardest .
I am at the same time , and the next day I am on television .
Then there is a kind of re@@ alignment to life , very slowly , for one or two months that are a bit like holiday .
How did medical exam@@ inations and de@@ bri@@ e@@ fin@@ g D@@ G@@ SE go ?
I had the right to first medical control in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The rest has been done in the V@@ al-@@ bri@@ g@@ ade , following my return : radio , gender exam@@ s , and a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that we can count on him , to remind him of it if need be , that we are not handed over to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostages .
That was logical .
It did not embarr@@ ass me .
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Ni@@ ger ?
I am listening to what is said .
The debate on ran@@ so@@ m in particular .
Some things irrit@@ ate me , others less .
I am trying to bring the issues of my past to the fore as a hostage and as chairman of the &apos; O@@ DA &apos; association , which allows me to distance myself , and I think it is much more interesting to talk about it .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Above all , I am fighting , along with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostage .
I think there is a problem with sem@@ an@@ tics .
We must call for hostages &apos; taking hostages &apos; - which is most of the time - and allowing the hostages to have access to justice , to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in comp@@ as@@ sion , in emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice ?
A court in The Hague is doing this .
Why do you not tell the ho@@ stag@@ e-@@ ta@@ kers &apos; you have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of war , such as those of all the Geneva Conventions , you are going to bring you to justice ? &apos;
It seems to me , however , that this is justified , legitimate and that common sense is being struck .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and I am shocked .
That is my main fight .
Egypt ’ s Islamists
The anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists is growing .
Two days before the trial of the de@@ posed President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
mobilisation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country &apos;s first democratically elected president .
It is not a trial that highlights the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s activis@@ t .
Until now , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunte@@ er has been able to take a copy of the documents .
It is not a trial , it is a far@@ ce .
President Mor@@ si ’ s trial is a false case against a pro-@@ Mor@@ si case , and he is supposed to make S@@ is@@ i judge , not the opposite .
Mor@@ si must judge S@@ is@@ i for the massacres in Ra@@ ab@@ a , the N@@ ah@@ da massacres , and the massacre of the Republican Gu@@ ard .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
There have been clashes in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police used te@@ ar gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo police ac@@ ade@@ my , where Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si will be judged .
H@@ ag@@ el repro@@ aches 9 US States to violate homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognised homosexual marriage , &apos; all military spouses have the right to an identity card of the Department of Defense and to the benefits coming with &apos; , reminded the Minister in New York in a speech to the An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ ef@@ am@@ ation League in the fight against anti-Semitism .
&apos;@@ But some states refuse to issue these cards to sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sex workers .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided on these bases , or access their shops .
The Secretary of Defense has said that he has ordered the head of the National Gu@@ ard , General Fr@@ ank Gr@@ ass , to ensure that the federal law is implemented .
The fron@@ t@@ loading of the nine states started by T@@ ex@@ as , which refuses to implement these benefits on the establishment of the T@@ ex@@ al National Gu@@ ard , due to a conflict between the text of the text and the Federal Law on homosexual marriage .
It was joined in its refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Car@@ ol@@ ine and Western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defence officer .
The Pen@@ tag@@ on believes the population concerned with recognition of homosexual marriage to around 5@@ 600 active people , 17 000 by including the National Gu@@ ard , reserve and pensioners .
Sixth edi@@ tion of the La@@ y Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard
The sixth edi@@ tion of the P@@ ay Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard takes place this Saturday , 2 November at the Par@@ k par@@ k in Hy@@ res .
Together with the S@@ K@@ 8 unit of the Bu@@ m@@ p Association , competition should bring together the best sk@@ y@@ makers in the region .
The regis@@ trations are taken on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start at 10 o &apos;@@ clock before the end at 3 p.m. and the award of prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to ad@@ mire the technical pro@@ w@@ ess of young people who , for some , already have competi@@ tions at the highest level , like the young hy@@ ero@@ is L@@ or@@ en@@ z@@ o P@@ lu@@ m@@ bo .
Only 10 years ago , he won his place for the European cham@@ pion@@ ships in Copenhagen this year , and he does not like anything so much as to go back to competitors who exceed three heads .
The May@@ or of Tor@@ onto hunting the question about a drug case
In Canada , the May@@ or of Tor@@ onto is suspected of indul@@ ging in several media .
A video handed to justice seems to support these suspic@@ ions .

The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of ra@@ b@@ ies was detected in a ch@@ at@@ on in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise , obviously of foreign origin , while France is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed from indigenous cases since 2001 .
The ch@@ at@@ on was found on 25 October in Ar@@ gen@@ l and he died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of ra@@ b@@ ies has been confirmed by the P@@ ast@@ er Institute .

The ministries are now calling for people who would have been dead , rap@@ ed , gre@@ ed , or l@@ acked a mu@@ d or a skin damaged by this ch@@ at@@ on or whose animal would have been in contact with this ch@@ at@@ on between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0@@ 8.@@ 11 , 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 95 , between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November .

Obama ’ s Health Re@@ turn
Under an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday on his un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable and often repeated promise that “ if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it . ”
After hundreds of thousands of people have received opinions from their providers , the Republic@@ ans have criticised the President over the last few days by acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
“ The vast majority of people with a health insurance that suits them can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
On the subject of what he calls “ a rise in the current situation ” about the termin@@ ations , President Obama has encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new market insurance .
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health systems for the same price , or even less expensive than expected .
“ You will win , ” he said .
The Administration has announced that one should not be surprised at the fact that the 5 % of the population who take their own insurance are being forced to change the system because their cover does not meet the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act .
‘ Let me address the Americans directly : you deserve better ’ , said K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us in his testi@@ mony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who over@@ sees the implementation of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act , said that the launch of the online market in October had failed &apos; la@@ ment@@ ably &apos; .
‘ I am as frustrated and irrit@@ ated as anyone ’ , she added .
I look forward to reg@@ ain@@ ing your confidence .
It was a K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated , who made this sentence , when she believed her micro@@ phone cut off , addressing a assist@@ ant sitting behind her at the session of the House yesterday following a contentious exchange of views with B@@ ill@@ ly L@@ ong , the Republican representative of the M@@ iss@@ our@@ i , to know whether she should join the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
For more than three hours , B@@ ill@@ ly L@@ ong has repeatedly urged Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us why “ the architec@@ t of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act ” had not voluntarily re@@ linqu@@ ished the government ’ s sponsored insurance to sign a regime via He@@ al@@ th@@ Car@@ e@@ .@@ go@@ v , which now bo@@ asts millions of Americans .

The German Sea Se@@ bas@@ ti@@ an Ve@@ tel , four World Cup cham@@ pion@@ ships of For@@ mul@@ a 1 , took over for the free trials of Abu D@@ hab@@ i &apos;s Gr@@ and Pri@@ x on Friday a special ca@@ p whose design was achieved by a Mexican fa@@ ke of 21 years .
That has been the choice of 1 500 drawn from all over the world , as part of a competition launched by one of the spons@@ ors , a car mark , its st@@ ays .
He has been invited to follow the G@@ P de Abu D@@ hab@@ i , with a friend , and can therefore look closely at the German champion , on the run@@ way and in his s@@ ong .
That was the last item on Friday and Saturday .
He is likely to have another special ca@@ p on Sunday for the race to mark his 4@@ th con@@ secu@@ tive global title .
A H@@ an in Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ a
Let us not dec@@ eive ourselves .
In the spirit of Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , his foun@@ der , the sub@@ ur@@ bs of the sub@@ ur@@ bs , is not only directed at ban@@ ds .
I have chosen a map of France as a lo@@ go .
When I speak of sub@@ ur@@ bs , I address all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , its draft , presented on Thursday at the press conference in its own home of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ lic , was born out of the desire to better defend multicul@@ tur@@ alism , this great cultural po@@ t which character@@ ises the areas above all .
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multicul@@ tur@@ alism .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , 50 years , a territorial att@@ ach@@ é , is now claiming to be &apos; 100 % a@@ political &apos; even though it has not always been neutral .
In 2002 , together with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ en@@ ement , he then supported locally Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the equality values that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if the right-wing people are prepared to support me , I will also listen to them .
There are only extremist parties that I am talking about .
In addition to multicul@@ tur@@ alism , Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ mu@@ ne has built up his programme - Inter@@ ne@@ t-@@ based - on the basis of many topics that are supposed to speak to people in sub@@ ur@@ bs , especially young people : the right to vote for foreigners , leg@@ alisation of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , the civil majority of 16 years , the rehabilitation of the function of the guardian of buildings ...
It remains to be found for candidates to form lists and to defend its ideas on the political scene , &apos; for the 2014 municipal elections , this is likely to be fair , recognise &apos; .
It is a problem of time and money .
The sub@@ ur@@ bs Party should , after all , be represented in Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ v through my candi@@ d@@ acy and I also hope in other cities .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ne ensures that seven heads of the list in me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an France and Mart@@ ini@@ que are already in place .
&apos;@@ And the ma@@ ils of support I have received since yesterday do not all come from sub@@ ur@@ bs &apos; .
John Ker@@ ry admitted , unprecedented , that American es@@ pion@@ age “ had gone too far . ”
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a weakening of the US ’ s defensive attitude to his surveillance programs , which , without a precedent , has been unprecedented , and , on several occasions , sp@@ ying “ had gone too far . ”
Secretary of State has also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , has governed “ automatic pilot ” when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations of the whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lowing Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about the N@@ SA sp@@ ying activities came into being .
The lea@@ ks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &apos; There is no doubt that the President , myself and other members of the government have taken on board certain things in an automatic pilot because we had the opportunity , from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War , and then of course on 11 September . &apos;
He then became the first high-@@ ranking member of the United States government to admit that American es@@ pion@@ age had gone beyond the bounds , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : “ In some cases , it has gone too far . ”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &apos; We live in a new world where people are prepared to get rid of . &apos;
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , explo@@ de them and attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they act ?
We have prevented aircraft from falling , buildings explo@@ ded and people are being murdered because we have been able to read the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to respond to the concerns about the alleged American es@@ pion@@ age affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States , which explained on Thursday the chairman of the Senate ’ s Sub@@ committee on European Affairs .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut said that he had spoken before the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made about the possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the sense of frustration that the National Security Agency has ar@@ oused .
“ It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain alongside us in mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism , ” declared Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first term , and Chairman of the US Senate ’ s Sub@@ committee on European Affairs in an interview from Washington .
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the N@@ SA programmes .
The press reports that the N@@ SA has cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which has damaged relations with some of the United States &apos; allies , but the director of the agency said this week that this was not true and that it was a misunderstanding because it was a misunderstanding that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations have reported documents issued by S@@ now@@ den that the N@@ SA had inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and that of 34 other heads of state .
The director of the intelligence services , James C@@ lar@@ l@@ er , justified the es@@ pion@@ age of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice on both sides .
In this tu@@ mul@@ t atmosphere , Mur@@ ph@@ y has indicated that his office is organising a cong@@ ress of Congress , which should take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and two cham@@ bers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be un@@ ve@@ iled in the coming days .
He said that the route remains to be defined .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the purpose of this journey was to improve relations , but also to show &apos; affec@@ tive firm@@ ness &apos; .
He has explained that European Heads of State must be honest with their citizens about the type of es@@ pion@@ age programmes that they themselves have been applying for years .
‘ We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only people in the world to be sp@@ ying , said Mur@@ ph@@ y .
In the meantime , Mr Ker@@ ry has planned to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resen@@ tment generated by US strategies in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .
The London Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change ended on Thursday , pl@@ agu@@ ed by S@@ hell ’ s poor performance , and following the Fed ’ s announcement that its support for the economy should be maintained as planned .
An Austr@@ ali@@ an
A twenty-@@ year-old Sy@@ d@@ ney who was sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et for allegedly claiming to have been attacked by a tax@@ i driver has appe@@ aled to the judgment and has been put on trial .
Ste@@ life Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first found guilty by a P@@ hu@@ k@@ et Court of Pro@@ v@@ ince on 15 June of false statements after telling the Tha@@ i police that a local tax@@ i driver , accompanied by two other men who controlled him , attacked him early on Sunday 10 June .
However , video record@@ ings later revealed that it was returned to its ho@@ tel safely after being separated from its small Austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
The P@@ hu@@ k@@ et police questioned B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she admitted that she invented the history of all parts .
It was held in a cell of the local commission before the court hearing .
B@@ am@@ ford was sentenced to a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a low-@@ security detention centre in the periphery of P@@ hu@@ k@@ et rather than in a prison for women .
It is the daughter of the former player of the Austr@@ ali@@ an League of ru@@ g@@ by Peter Tun@@ ks , who has appe@@ aled to the Can@@ ber@@ ra Foreign Ministry to help her daughter .
Tun@@ ks told the Sunday Te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h of Sy@@ d@@ ney that the entire family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted it to return to Australia .
“ We have , of course , experienced an an@@ gu@@ ish moment , but we hope to bring it back to the house safely as soon as possible , ” said Tun@@ ks .
B@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled to the judgment and was put on trial after a ca@@ p of 50 000 ba@@ its was paid .
In Australia , the press said that , in the meantime , it was on holiday in the region of K@@ ra@@ bi , southern Thailand .
Tha@@ i judicial sources have indicated that B@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local lawyer in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et , but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence that could go up to two years imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison .
However , after the recent murder in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et of Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith , an Austr@@ ali@@ an vo@@ y@@ age , Thailand could also seek to restore its damaged image to tourists , which could lead to an acqu@@ it@@ tal .
The French police will stop the supporters of Andersson from the R@@ S@@ C@@ A
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Ro@@ yal S@@ port@@ in@@ g C@@ lu@@ b of Ander@@ le@@ ch@@ t against the Paris Sain@@ t Ger@@ man@@ t , which was set on Tuesday , sent Mari@@ e Ver@@ be@@ ke , the spokesman for the police area from Brussels to noon on Friday .
The Belgian supporters of the S@@ S@@ C@@ A who want to go to this meeting of the Cha@@ mp@@ ions League will have to use the travel system set up by the S@@ S@@ C@@ A .
&apos;@@ The bus con@@ voy will be es@@ cor@@ ted by the police since a former border post from Re@@ ke@@ m to the P@@ S@@ G stage &apos; , passed the spokesman .
It will be the same for return .
&quot; If other f@@ ans had a intention to go to Paris by other means , French police pre@@ fec@@ ture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even to the gar@@ den guards , which has still announced Mari@@ e Ver@@ be@@ ke .
Mo@@ ving together in French , the challenge of the Mar@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ ys
At the Mar@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ ys school committee 62 % of pupils have a mother tongue other than French .
A year ago , this was the reason for consultation with parents , pupils , teachers and members of education staff , to reflect on how to better integrate pupils who live together between several cultures .
The school committee has just revealed its vision of &apos; Li@@ ver as a whole in French &apos; .
The V@@ ision diversity organis@@ m has been around for a year in schools to help pupils of all origins to find common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language .
The discovery of neighbour@@ hoods , our architecture , our places are benchmarks .
Lar@@ ge names of writ@@ ers , artists , whether they are in strain or come from elsewhere .
Who are our buil@@ ders ?
Thus , we are creating projects so that they can identify with everything , explains the President of V@@ ision diversity , A@@ id@@ a K@@ am@@ ar .
Michel V@@ are@@ n , the New World Institute , identified several challenges for the school committee .
&apos;@@ On the transmission , for example , of what is known as the qu@@ é@@ g@@ é@@ g@@ é culture , the feeling of belonging , support for staff in the trans@@ forma@@ tions that we are living through , within the student cli@@ ent &apos; .
The Mar@@ g@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ y@@ s Committee has set up a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who , too , sometimes come from elsewhere .
