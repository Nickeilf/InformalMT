K@@ e@@ ep W@@ ing@@ e in Bo@@ go@@ ta
The sport@@ sman and woman J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lor@@ z has s@@ nat@@ ched a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter on Bo@@ go@@ ta , the Colombian capital , on Thursday .
E@@ qui@@ pped by a w@@ ing@@ line ( a combination of w@@ ings ) , it has risen to 160 km / h over the famous Mon@@ ser@@ r@@ ate sanc@@ tu@@ ary , located in more than 3 000 metres of al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ ges gathered to observe his fe@@ at .
A black box in your car ?
While America &apos;s road network pl@@ ann@@ ers find it hard to find the money to repair the motor@@ way infrastructure in dec@@ ep@@ tiveness , many see a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the car scoreboard .
The appli@@ ances , all of which have been driven by a car driver and trans@@ mit information to officials , are at the heart of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the major American roads .
The sector , which is generally without interest from the planning of the major a@@ xes , has suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbul@@ ent alliances .
The liber@@ tari@@ ans joined green groups to press for the government to use small bo@@ xes to keep track of the mir@@ rors that you , and perhaps the road you are moving , can look at , and then use the information to draft a draft tax law .
The Te@@ a Party is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And , while members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue , several states did not wait .
They are looking for how , over the next decade , they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of motor@@ ists have already embarked on these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with a surveillance system by G@@ PS , for an experimental vice .
That really is essential for our nation .
&apos;@@ It is not as if we had the choice &apos; , said H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ ha@@ it@@ a , Director-General of the Sou@@ ther@@ n California Association of Govern@@ ance , which states that the state is starting to register the miles travelled by every Califor@@ n@@ ian car driver by 20@@ 25 . .
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the country &apos;s High@@ way Fund Fund , financed with the taxes that Americans pay for the p@@ ump , is financially sec@@ tarian .
Americans no longer buy as much g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine as before .
C@@ ars can travel more miles with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are reluctant to increase the tax , even by 1 % , while the price of petrol is high .
The &apos; g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not tenable &apos; , said Le@@ e M@@ un@@ ich , a specialist in transport policy at the University of Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
Its state has recently made trac@@ es out of 500 cars to test a payment system in the mir@@ ror .
“ This is the most logical long-term alternative , ” he said .
W@@ on@@ ks calls that the cost of mil@@ e@@ age .
It is not surprising that the se@@ duc@@ tive idea of the Liberals , as taxes could be used to change driving habits in such a way as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California ’ s pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system as they draw up strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state ’ s ambitious global warming laws .
But Bill Sh@@ us@@ ter ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a ) , Chairman of the House of Representatives ’ Transport Committee , said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term .
Op@@ ponents of the free market from the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation also appreciate the idea of having drivers pay in the mir@@ ror .
“ It is not just a tax that is eng@@ ul@@ fed in a large black hole , ” A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , the Vice-President of politics , said to the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits offered to them .
The movement is also supported by two former US secre@@ tar@@ ies in Transport , which , in a 2011 report , urged Congress to go down the line of payment .
The US Senate approved a $ 90 ( $ 90 ) pilot project last year that would have focused on about 10 000 cars .
But the President ’ s presidency killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural legislators who represent voters who have to travel from many miles to work or city .
A number of states and large cities , however , are making progress on their own .
The most determined is O@@ reg@@ on , which has mobilised 5 000 drivers to carry out the country &apos;s most important experience .
These motor@@ ists will soon pay the state for mil@@ e@@ age charges instead of petrol taxes .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
The city of New York is contempl@@ ating one .
Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is trying to test a limited number of lorries .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of America ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) is studying how it could implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where approximately 50 voluntary motor@@ ists have recently f@@ itted their cars with a de@@ vice , drivers were worried that the government could keep their finger on the record .
&apos;@@ The concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and this kind of thing are a big problem &apos; , said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din K@@ han , who heads the strategic performance of performance in the Department of N@@ ev@@ ada .
This is not something that people want .
Right from the start , the N@@ ev@@ ada of N@@ ev@@ ada was warning of its site : “ It would be relatively easy to convert these appli@@ ances into fully-@@ fledged location devices . ”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep people &apos;s daily and daily record@@ ings .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is one of the few countries that are now struggling to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car runs , but without knowing the exact place or the time .
If you can do that , he added , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-@@ up of California in the name of T@@ ue Mil@@ e .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society was not intended to help motor@@ ists who pay taxes to the Member States .
It sought to pene@@ tr@@ ate the emerging market in self-@@ insurance , in which drivers would pay according to kilome@@ tre .
But the appli@@ ances it tests have pl@@ agu@@ ed pl@@ ann@@ ers of the major a@@ xes because they do not use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , perio@@ dic@@ ally down@@ loaded down@@ loaded .
“ People will be more likely to do that if you don ’ t have their speed and do not loc@@ ate them . ” R@@ y@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , head General of T@@ ue Mil@@ ev@@ age , has said .
Lar@@ ge mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of certain states .
There are far less expensive means and less intru@@ sive methods of doing so .
In O@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers try to experiment by offering motor@@ ists different choices .
They can choose a de@@ vice with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have any apparatus at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay a for@@ tress based on the average number of miles travelled by all the residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to citizens suspicious by allowing appli@@ ances to do more , rather than not enough .
In New York City , transport officials seek to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for par@@ king costs , to provide “ payment for driving ” insurance , and to create a set of data on real-@@ time speed from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to prevent them . C@@ l@@ assi@@ fication .
&apos;@@ Au@@ thor@@ ists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them &apos; , indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers are wondering whether the whole debate on payment in the mir@@ ror is not just a huge di@@ version .
In the Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an Commission Commission in the San Franc@@ is@@ co Bay area , those responsible say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund by increasing petrol taxes .
A single annual or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of petrol , so that everyone pays their fair share .
“ There is no need to resort to radical sur@@ ger@@ y when you simply need aspir@@ in , ” said Mrs R@@ en@@ sch@@ er , the director of legislation and public affairs to the committee .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motor@@ ists will be worried about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bo@@ we : There are four new items in the eye of the floor .
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an has not come to any surprise this year .
From The N@@ ex@@ t Day , appeared in January , he co@@ b@@ b@@ led together a luxury re@@ edi@@ tion planned for 4 November , with several new news .
Four have already emerged on the We@@ b .
The announcement of a new al@@ bu@@ m of David Bo@@ we had left the whole pan@@ ace@@ a .
On his 6@@ 6@@ th birth@@ day , 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ bu@@ m would come out in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last record , Re@@ ality , dating back to 2003 ) and too few public appearances in public , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an was proving that he could still be counted as a po@@ p .
A F@@ es@@ se for his f@@ ans
Not tired of sur@@ prises , David Bo@@ we had more in his ba@@ g with The N@@ ex@@ t Day .
In this way , the Tha@@ in Du@@ ke planned to re@@ produce this al@@ bu@@ m on 4 November .
For the time , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a real f@@ es@@ tive for his f@@ ans .
This re@@ publication , entitled The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a , will be in the form of three dis@@ cs : the original al@@ bu@@ m , the stu@@ di@@ o sessions and the re@@ bu@@ x@@ es , as well as a D@@ V@@ D containing the four c@@ lic@@ ps already revealed .
The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a will contain a total of ten additional ti@@ t@@ les in relation to the original al@@ bu@@ m : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x edi@@ tion , five s@@ ong@@ s un@@ specially revealed for the occasion , as well as two re@@ tur@@ nees .
Indeed , David Bo@@ we made the presen@@ tations of this beautiful co@@ ff@@ t on a video .
It introduces both of the records , but also the acc@@ ess@@ ories provided with : exclusive photo@@ graph@@ s , a car@@ t to share his own im@@ pres@@ sions , a book with words ...
And , above all , it provides a fore@@ taste of its new title , At@@ om@@ ica , typically in the N@@ ex@@ t Day ve@@ in , with high@@ er-@@ profile gu@@ ides and well-@@ managed ro@@ ck@@ -@@ controlled electricity .
D@@ ep@@ ri@@ ts already in the eye of the House
But At@@ om@@ ica is not the only title to un@@ cover his weapons .
The In@@ forming , Li@@ ke A M@@ an M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O is also available on the Internet .
The information is on the face : a wor@@ ris@@ ome in@@ tre@@ p@@ o before a light ca@@ val@@ c@@ ade , which is gradually slowing down to a po@@ p po@@ p .
On Li@@ ke A Ro@@ k@@ et M@@ an , has Bo@@ we wanted to make a small reference to the Ro@@ ck@@ et M@@ an of El@@ ton John , or even to G@@ ran@@ ty ?
With this title , the sing@@ er seems to be in his place when he no longer has his feet on the ground .
S@@ pace O@@ d@@ di@@ ty , alongside it , was much more serious .
On Bor@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , David Bo@@ we once again refers to his str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold : would he come from another planet ?
The s@@ na@@ ff@@ ers of gu@@ ta@@ re , a so@@ ber gu@@ y , want to leave the Earth .
In any case , Bo@@ we is playing into the hands of these ti@@ t@@ les : in turn , an informa@@ tive turn , a man on board a f@@ us@@ s , a potential mar@@ tial ...
It conce@@ als and reveals both , plays to adopt different person@@ alities , as he has done throughout his career , particularly with his Z@@ i@@ gg@@ y St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ addi@@ in S@@ ane figures .
It is no wonder , therefore , that he has a m@@ ask in the photo@@ grap@@ h of the In@@ vi@@ itation in the Vo@@ y@@ age , of the brand Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , whose new face he embo@@ dies .
It will appear in one of their adver@@ ts , broadcast from 10 November .
The Defence Minister , Ro@@ b Nichol@@ son , insisted that the injured soldiers were not sum@@ marily released from the Canadian Ar@@ med For@@ ces , and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life .
At@@ t@@ ached by liberals and neo-@@ democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr Nichol@@ son assured us that , prior to their release , the members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
All injured soldiers are receiving the appropriate care for their return to civilian life , and none of them are released before they are ready , he said .
Cri@@ tics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the w@@ ounded soldiers - who do not comply with the &apos; univers@@ ality of the service &apos; of the army , demanding that the staff be able to carry out a variety of tasks - to reach the ad@@ mis@@ sibility period of 10 years required for benefits . retirement .
In particular , they cited two cases reported by the Pres@@ se C@@ ase , including that of a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Corpor@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a London reser@@ vis@@ t , at On@@ tari@@ o , reached post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , was released from the army despite its request to stay for another year in order to receive a fully inde@@ xed pension .
His case came after that of Corpor@@ al G@@ l@@ en Kir@@ on , who said to a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not respond to the rule of univers@@ ality of service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared to leave , with plans and meetings , but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;@@ I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said in a meeting with P@@ Pres@@ se Can@@ ad@@ ian on Wednesday .
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay , and they said no .
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has been struggling to determine the extent to which it can grant the injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks , but who are not fit for the fight .
Under the current rules , the soldiers who are seriously injured have up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for foreign deploy@@ ments , they can be forced to leave the army .
The data presented last year in Parliament indicates that , of the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons , 19@@ 9 did not reach the time required to obtain pension benefits .
The liberal spokes@@ person for ex-@@ combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked for the reintegration of Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins on Wednesday , while the neo-@@ democr@@ at J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for an immediate end to &quot; this shameful practice . &quot;
Dis@@ ney t@@ ab@@ let to launch an anim@@ ated series
The American Dis@@ tric@@ t and Media Group has decided to give priority to t@@ ab@@ lets to its own television channels for the coming of a new set of children .
The first nine episo@@ des of S@@ her@@ i@@ ff C@@ alli@@ s Wil@@ d West will be available from 24 November on the We@@ ch@@ dis@@ y@@ y@@ y@@ .@@ co@@ m site or through its application for tele@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
Its global launch on the Dis@@ ney Group &apos;s channels is scheduled only in 2014 , details the communi@@ qu@@ é of its division Dis@@ ney J@@ un@@ or .
The car@@ to@@ on , for children aged between 2 and 7 , tells the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the Cha@@ at@@ i C@@ ally , a sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of a city in the west of the United States , where it puts order with a magic mo@@ on .
Each episo@@ de consists of two histor@@ ies of 11 minutes .
&apos;@@ Inter@@ vention of smar@@ t@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commented on Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , Vice-President responsible for digital products at Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , cited in the communi@@ qu@@ é .
This type of experience comes in the context of Dis@@ ney &apos;s efforts to &apos; extend the life of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important &apos; , and he has added .
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Comm@@ on@@ se Sen@@ se Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of less than two years have already used a t@@ ab@@ let or a telephone , and 72 % of less than 8 % , compared to 10 % and 38 % respectively . Two years ago .
S@@ now@@ den is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance .
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , denoun@@ cing US intelligence , said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and his director K@@ e@@ it@@ h Alexander did not provide answers on their activities .
The German MEP Hans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ ö@@ be@@ le met Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia on Thursday , where he has the right of asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter which the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a le@@ ak and seeks to penalise political dis@@ course with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . &apos;
However , telling the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon criminal charges against him .
In the case of the complaint lod@@ ged by the US Ministry of Justice , he is accused of es@@ pion@@ age and the@@ ft of state goods .
Hans@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich , the German Interior Minister , said in Z@@ ee@@ it On@@ line : “ If Mr S@@ now@@ den is prepared to speak to German officials , we will make that possible . ”
Relations between the United States and Germany were put to the test as a result of complaints that the N@@ SA had been listening to the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Thomas O@@ pen@@ n , the Member who heads the parliamentary group over@@ looking the foreign secret services , said that if there was a chance to hear Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness ‘ without putting it in jeop@@ ar@@ dy and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States ’ , that would have to be taken advantage of .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a German MEP , published a pho@@ to of him with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
During his visit to Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that , according to the advocate of the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Mr S@@ now@@ den could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den testi@@ fied in Germany , he would have to be assured that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , said the Member .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a campaign of &apos; serious and sustained &apos; persecution which forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global response to &apos; my act of political expression &apos; .
Citizens around the world and senior officials – including in the United States – thought that the re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was of public uti@@ lity .
The letter offers an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Co@@ gl@@ ec@@ o C@@ able could soon offer inter@@ active television
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able ’ s subscri@@ bers may well have access to applications such as Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter , and ultimate video service on demand for Net@@ f@@ li@@ x on television in a future that does not seem so far away .
The Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary has indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the language version of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;@@ This will enable us to highlight more us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces and more options &apos; , explained the President and head of the Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o management , Lou@@ is Aud@@ et , in meeting .
Co@@ gl@@ ec@@ o C@@ able , like Bel@@ l , is following the same line , even if the Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary has not yet set a precise date for this new platform .
&apos;@@ We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail &apos; , highlighted Mr Aud@@ et .
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers have no access at the moment .
The giant telecommunications giant Ro@@ g@@ ers has already indicated that he could offer Net@@ f@@ li@@ x if some technical details , which have not been mentioned , could be settled .
In the United States , the popular video service says that it is in discussions with some major c@@ able distributors so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
The case of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able also welcomed the announcement made by the Har@@ per government during his Tro@@ ika speech on 16 October .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force TV and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the services on the map .
&apos;@@ It has been about two and a half years that we are saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large packages of chains does not work &apos; , has said Mr Aud@@ et .
It hopes , however , that the consultations carried out by the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications Council ( CR@@ T@@ C ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;@@ It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference for defining our new Canadian cultural policy in relation to television , &apos; , said the &apos; Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o &apos; .
The CR@@ T@@ C has been consulting with the public since last week and should continue with the industry next spring .
On the results , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o indicated that he had a net profit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 by action .
This is a step backwards compared to the net benefit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million , or 83 by action , of the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this decline with depreci@@ ation costs linked to new acquis@@ i@@ tions .
In 2012 , Col@@ ec@@ o made the At@@ lan@@ c Bro@@ ad@@ band c@@ able , established in the United States , for EUR 1.@@ 36 billion .
This was the first major acquisition of the company after that which had failed in Portugal .
In December , the company also bought Pe@@ er 1 Network En@@ ter@@ prise , an Internet supplier in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , for the sum of EUR 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s income , they grew 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter to 50@@ 4.@@ 7 million .
They are EUR 1.@@ 8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able , has been 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 % action , in line with the 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million or 93 action taken over the same period last year .
The income of Co@@ gl@@ ec@@ o C@@ able has increased by 45 % , however , to 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 clients in the fourth quarter .
However , for the 2013 financial year , the number of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able customers is increasing by 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Aud@@ et is not concerned about the number of customers fluctu@@ ating in this way .
As far as I am concerned , this is not an indication of a change of trend , he has observed .
This varies from quarter to quarter to very lively competition .
H@@ or@@ se in beef products
H@@ al meat was found in can@@ ned bo@@ vine bo@@ xes , sold by two small British teachers of low-cost distribution , today announced the food hygiene agency .
P@@ rou@@ d tests have revealed that products , drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the Home Affairs and Qu@@ al@@ ty Sa@@ ve chains , contained hor@@ ses of between 1 % and 5 % .
&apos;@@ As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the British agency .
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in co@@ o@@ ked plants broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests in Ireland .
According to exam@@ inations by the European Commission , France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles resulted in four injured , on Friday , on the 1@@ 31 road in Lan@@ audi@@ res .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ th , a motor@@ ist who was in the north , in Sain@@ t F@@ eli@@ x in Val@@ o@@ is , lost the ma@@ ster@@ y of his vehicle and h@@ umb@@ led a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occup@@ i@@ ers of the two vehicles were injured , but they were not afraid for their lives .
The movement had returned to the normal stage on Friday , on Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make hand lu@@ gg@@ age pay
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines is planning to pay up to $ 100 for passengers transporting hand@@ bag@@ s on their flights .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines is planning to start making up to $ 100 for a hand b@@ agg@@ age and $ 2 for a coffee or a sole , though in his announcement on Wednesday she said that passengers could take the can@@ ta off with them at the plane ’ s des@@ cent .
New hand lu@@ gg@@ age has to do with bag@@ s in the higher compar@@ tment , so the small bag@@ s inst@@ alled in the seat will always be free .
Fron@@ tier has said that it will pay $ 25 if the costs are paid in advance and $ 100 if travellers pay only once on the do@@ or@@ step .
The Fron@@ tier spokesman , K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , said that USD 100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance .
‘ We do not want to make this price pay ’ , she has explained .
The airlines have started to make the first and second lu@@ gg@@ age recorded in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who were trying to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in hand lu@@ gg@@ age in the higher compar@@ tments , so there was often no room for them in these compar@@ tments .
These costs are a way of ensuring that passengers transport less on board .
Mr O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a question of making it clear to Fron@@ tier customers that it is becoming more and more difficult to find room in the higher compar@@ tments .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers buying their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger qu@@ e@@ ue at a bo@@ arding door in Fron@@ tier could transport a ba@@ g free of charge , while the next person in the qu@@ e@@ ue could have to pay $ 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley explained that the Fron@@ tier registration site and registration procedures are changing in order to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before arriving at the door .
Fron@@ tier lu@@ gg@@ age costs will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are often ru@@ ining the cost of b@@ agg@@ age and other costs , but the airlines love them .
They believe that the cost of handling lu@@ gg@@ age is important and that the passengers who want this service should pay it .
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of b@@ agg@@ age charges as a sign that the airlines are paying a high price to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them have not affected b@@ agg@@ age costs .
S@@ pi@@ rit Air@@ lines In@@ c@@ . applied the first hand b@@ agg@@ age costs three years ago , and the company is following a little later .
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , who said the consul@@ tant to the airlines of J@@ ay S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , who are closely following the costs in addition .
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that S@@ pi@@ rit ’ s hand in hand b@@ agg@@ age reported $ 50 a year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former M@@ id@@ west Air@@ lines framework , recently travelled to S@@ pi@@ rit and won@@ dered what he was going to find at the door of bo@@ arding when passengers would discover the un@@ conventional hand b@@ agg@@ age charges imposed by the company .
“ I had never seen such a flu@@ id bo@@ arding procedure in my professional career , ” he said .
I had expected to have te@@ eth and a w@@ rest@@ ling at the door .
The plane was full , he added , &apos; passengers are on board at the speed of the day &apos; .
Fron@@ tier , too , is like S@@ pi@@ rit and applies $ 2 for a coffee , te@@ a , so@@ da , or a fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier has indicated that passengers taking a so@@ da or a fruit ju@@ ice can take the non-@@ open can@@ e with them , and those who take up coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
Air@@ ways briefly tried to make drinks pay in 2008 , but went back seven months later , after the passengers complained and no other large airline had followed .
The Fron@@ tier decision to pay hand lu@@ gg@@ age when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go on his site .
Air@@ lines pay for online sales like Or@@ mi@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket .
This has led all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of talking to an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier has gone further in this area .
In September , it began to offer only half of the loyalty mir@@ rors to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it reduced the mine premiums by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a Fron@@ tier journey 1 000 miles from an on-@@ line travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their headquarters in advance if they buy their ticket directly on the Fron@@ tier site .
Fron@@ tier is a faithful cli@@ en@@ te@@ le in his home town , Den@@ ver , but his activity is moving backwards and it is losing money .
The revenue has fallen by 9 % and its flight capacity has fallen by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company , R@@ public Air@@ ways Hol@@ dings In@@ c .

The N@@ SA calls into question an “ internal error , ” not ha@@ c@@ kers for the breakdown of its site .
The National Security Agency , working in the shadow of the shadow , said on Friday that it was a bu@@ g that caused the public site to run for a few hours , not ha@@ c@@ kers , as some had claimed to be online .
&apos;@@ N@@ SA@@ N@@ go@@ v has remained un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for a few hours this evening because of an internal error which took place during a planned update &apos; , referred to the agency of sp@@ ying in a statement by em@@ ail .
The problem will be resolved this evening .
The allegations that the breakdown was due to an attack on the denial service ( D@@ S@@ D ) are wrong .
Ear@@ lier this evening , online ser@@ vers noted that the N@@ SA site had broken down for at least 6 hours , and some users still do not have access to the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokesman indicated in A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the agency ’ s sensitive internal network was not “ at all ” compromise .
No classified information is at risk , has explained the spokesman .
At least a group of online h@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ ers claimed to be responsible for the N@@ SA ’ s breakdown by a D@@ S@@ D attack .
D@@ S@@ D ’ s attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
The cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system .
The N@@ SA used to be ul@@ tr@@ a co@@ ver@@ t , a time du@@ b@@ bed the “ N@@ o Su@@ gen@@ c@@ y , ” has come under the spot@@ light and sharply criticised in recent months as a result of a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its extensive national and national communications surveillance programs . This is part of the secret N@@ SA files stolen from the agency and dis@@ closed by the former N@@ SA dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed consul@@ tant Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
This growing controversy over the agency has led to a lot of speculation that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
The Del@@ ta Centre now closed
The Del@@ ta C@@ ore Ho@@ tel closed its doors on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that had the edi@@ fic@@ e sold it to promo@@ ters who will turn it into student homes .
Three hundred and fifty people worked in the ho@@ tel .
Of these , 200 have still not found a new job .
Del@@ ta promises not to let his employees fall .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers have come to meet employees directly on the spot , and they have met with their own employees in order to assess their needs .
&apos;@@ This will continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the UNHCR working relations , F@@ eli@@ x B@@ is@@ son .
The closure of the Del@@ ta is taking place in a very competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make .
Either he re@@ investing in the building to continue to operate , so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition was very fierce , there were many new hot@@ els that appeared in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&apos;@@ Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tively , they sell it to someone else and that is what happened &apos; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ra@@ ult , the holder of the Tourism C@@ ar Trans@@ at to the U@@ Q@@ A@@ M Management Sci@@ ences Scho@@ ol .
Other Mon@@ tre@@ al hot@@ els will also be converted in the coming months , such as the C@@ rown P@@ la@@ za , which will become a residence for the elderly .
In the meantime , four ho@@ tel projects tot@@ alling almost 600 cham@@ bers will come into being in two years &apos; time .
For the CE@@ O of Ti@@ tan , &apos; the project for the purchase of Go@@ od@@ year A@@ mi@@ ens is starting with zero employed &apos; .
Having f@@ iled a sp@@ ate in January for the partial resumption of the Go@@ od@@ year &apos;s Go@@ od@@ year site promised for closure , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , the CE@@ O of the American ty@@ ma@@ ker Ti@@ tan , is now saying that he is prepared to save 3@@ 33 jobs on the 1 137 which are counts . The plant .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ te@@ burg , Minister for productive recovery , had already announced this , on Monday 21 October .
Having renoun@@ ced the plan to purchase the plant in January , you are now returning .
You had pronounced violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about &apos; so-called workers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; cra@@ zy &apos; trade unions , by targeting the G@@ F@@ T .
We do not understand this ab@@ out@@ -@@ turn .
Is it to please Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Well , I would like to say to my wife .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg , it is a ch@@ arming young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
If I have injured someone through my words , I am sorry .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Does the truth hurt you ?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handic@@ ap France .
In India , China and in other countries , we work 10 to 12 hours a day .
But I do not have any prejudices about France .
What I see is a plant that produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is located and has space to grow .
Why does Ti@@ tan need this plant so much ?
There is no need to buy this plant .
But , with the correct price and the competent workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement are you waiting for between the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Go@@ od@@ year has offered employees a good start allowance , I think that 100 % of the employees would have accepted it .
Now let us imagine that Ti@@ tan is buying the closed plant to Go@@ od@@ year .
So Ti@@ tan could move machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency .
I think Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg knows that .
He wants to keep the plant in A@@ mi@@ ens with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid jobs .
T@@ yp@@ ically , they can recru@@ it some of the 1@@ ,@@ 200 current Go@@ od@@ year employees .
So Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a commitment from Ti@@ tan before trying to get the G@@ T@@ T to come to the table with Go@@ od@@ year .
The first step is that the G@@ T@@ C@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year form an agreement on the original allowances for all employees .
So there will be no more employees in the plant .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you are prepared to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm this ?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four@@ -year guarantee .
But , as I said , the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year must first agree on initial allowances .
If all workers accept them , the plant ’ s plan to purchase the plant starts with zero .
How can we give guarantees of employment time when there are no longer any employees on the site ?
If Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg succe@@ eds in getting the G@@ F@@ C@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year to come to an agreement and Ti@@ tan bu@@ ys the factory , we intend to stay in A@@ mi@@ en@@ -@@ north more than four years .
The benefits of a shrin@@ king B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , while deli@@ veries and orders for aircraft are shrin@@ king
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er In@@ c , the Canadian aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical and rail manufacturer , reported a 15 % fall in its net profit on Thursday , under pressure from a reduction in orders and deli@@ veries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Tr@@ ust Di@@ vision .
B@@ om@@ b@@ ar@@ di@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , has also failed to provide test data for his new@@ com@@ er , C@@ Ser@@ ies , or information about whether the plane will comply with his ambitious timetable for marketing before next September .
After the inaug@@ ural flight of the test plane about one and a half months ago , it only stolen three times , and the question then asked whether the trial phase was on the right track .
The results were not equal to the forecasts and stock prices fell by 8 % on the Tor@@ onto Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change .
Cameron , an analy@@ st in the National Bank of Finance , has low@@ ered his rating , from “ over@@ performance ” to “ sector performance ” on Thursday , owing to the low potential of the stock exchange in the next quarter or the next two quarters .
&apos;@@ Although the fall in aircraft deli@@ veries was largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Di@@ vision , said Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen on a note to customers .
We believe that B@@ om@@ b@@ ar@@ di@@ er will have new orders for her aircraft , C@@ Ser@@ ies , as the flight test programme moves forward .
However , if no new order is forthcoming in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ e hopes that the family of C@@ Ser@@ ies can cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the lower seg@@ ment of a market that is now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and for the first time in September , after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for the C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft has so far been 17@@ 7 to the tune of 17@@ 7 , and it seems that potential bu@@ yers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to valid@@ ate the asser@@ tions made by society regarding energy efficiency and the potential savings potential of the new air@@ lin@@ er .
At present , society has recorded a total of 40@@ 3 orders and purchasing commitments with 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ ow@@ in , the president and head of management , is convinced that B@@ om@@ ar@@ di@@ er will achieve his goal of 300 firm orders before the first flight takes place .
The leaders also reassured the analy@@ sts and the media on Thursday that the programme was moving forward in accordance with the timetable .
‘ The test plane has not been on the ground for longer than expected ’ , Mr Be@@ au@@ ow@@ n said at a telephone conference , adding that ground tests and software up@@ dates were planned during the time for the flight to the aircraft .
Each manufacturer is planning in a different way .
We decided to take a first flight and to provide for a period of updating , and that is what we have done .
This will happen again in the course of the flight programme .
The second of the five test planes should fly in the coming weeks , and the others will follow shortly after , have indicated society .
Yet analy@@ sts are skep@@ tical that the first customer can fly a C@@ Ser@@ ies plane only 12 months after his inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er has indicated that it is in the process of assessing the timetable for entry into operation and will provide new information in the coming months .
“ This slow flight test – though apparently in line with the internal agenda of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er – reinforces our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , said Mr Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
In the third quarter of September 30 September , B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net benefit fell to $ 14@@ 7 , or 8 c@@ ents per action , compared to $ 17@@ 2 , or 9 c@@ ents per action , one year earlier .
The adjusted action has remained unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
In@@ come fell slightly by 4.@@ 2 to $ 4.@@ 1 M@@ d .
An@@ aly@@ sts expected a result of 10 c@@ ents per action and $ 4.@@ 56 M@@ d , according to Thomas Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / E / S@@ .
The world &apos;s fourth aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical manufacturer indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter of the year , compared to 57 a year earlier .
N@@ et orders have fallen to 26 aircraft , against 83 previously .
The back@@ war@@ dness of the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical Di@@ vision accounted for 3@@ 2.@@ 9 M@@ d to 30 September , a figure that remained on 31 December of the previous year .
&apos;@@ In A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing &apos; , said Mr Be@@ au@@ ow@@ in .
A@@ ero@@ au@@ tical ’ s incomes have fallen by 13 % to $ 2@@ ,@@ M@@ ade .
B@@ om@@ bar@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , has said that the income from this division has increased by almost 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 million .
The orders for the Transport Di@@ vision total@@ ed 3@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ ade to 30 September , a slight increase in comparison with 31 December of the previous year .
The margins of the Transport Di@@ vision have suffered from implementing problems with a few major contracts .
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter .
The actions of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ech@@ et@@ te , head of the financial management of Google In@@ c , will sit on the board of directors of the Management Board , has dropped from 8@@ .5 % to Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazil ’ s company Em@@ br@@ er SA , the world ’ s third-@@ largest aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical buil@@ der and competi@@ tor in B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , has indicated a 10 % reduction in its quar@@ terly benefits .
Two s@@ pen@@ lo@@ olog@@ ists of 23 and 27 years of age were missing in a cha@@ s@@ m under the D@@ ent D@@ ent since Thursday evening , on Friday , we learned from the S@@ p@@ el@@ é@@ o rescue of the Is@@ ler .
They were loc@@ alised this afternoon .
The two men , in practice , and the other not , left on the ground on Thursday at 9.@@ 30 p.m. in order to carry out a crossing from the D@@ ent of C@@ l@@ ls , located on the municip@@ ality of Sain@@ t Pi@@ er@@ re de Ch@@ Char@@ tr@@ a .
There was no new one since then , and the same source made the same point .

Do@@ z@@ ens of People there
Some 20 aid workers , ten civilians in French S@@ p@@ el@@ é@@ o S@@ aid , and the police , C@@ R@@ S and fire bri@@ g@@ ades were there .
At the end of the afternoon this Friday , the two s@@ p@@ ag@@ olog@@ ists were loc@@ alised .
&apos;@@ It is another group of s@@ p@@ ag@@ olog@@ ists who , after having found them exhausted but in good health , sent the information to one of the rescue teams , &apos; explains Le D@@ au@@ p@@ us .
Both military and Cha@@ m@@ b@@ é@@ ry &apos; s 13@@ th bat@@ tal@@ ion were found &apos; exhausted but not injured &apos; .
They lost out in the network , returned to their homes while waiting for the relief , specified pre@@ fec@@ ture .
Re@@ n@@ our@@ ished , they should come out of the c@@ av@@ ity with the help of aid workers in the evening .
German Jour@@ n@@ alists , invited to flee Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o
The German journalists &apos; union , on Thursday , invited its members to stop using Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o online services following further re@@ vel@@ ations about the activities of US and British intelligence services .
&apos;@@ The German Jour@@ n@@ alists &apos; Federation recommends that journalists prevent the use of the search engines and the mess@@ aging of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o &apos; , as she says in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
It considers &apos; scandalous &apos; information from the Washington Po@@ st , according to which the United States National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) and the British Government He@@ ad@@ quarters He@@ ad@@ quarters ( G@@ CC ) have collected m@@ asses of information by inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the international networks that allow the two firms to syn@@ chron@@ ise Their ser@@ vers .
&apos; Jour@@ n@@ alists &apos; research is as confidential as details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &apos; , in addition to Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ k@@ en , the President of the trade union , who is claiming 3@@ 8@@ ,000 members .
They have been re@@ pain@@ ted : a Member calls for Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els to resign .
Minister Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els &apos; project of &apos; re@@ connec@@ ting &apos; the traffic light po@@ les in Brussels does not please everyone .
As a reminder , this Thursday , Brussels Minister of Public Labour and Transport , in the centre of Brussels , launched a test project to pain@@ t 16 po@@ les of traffic lights from the region to the y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ours of Brussels .
The aim is , at the same time , &apos; to increase security &apos; and &apos; Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long run , to re@@ pain@@ t all the traffic lights Brussels , at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
But the blue choice chosen by the Minister is &apos; too d@@ row@@ ned &apos; , according to the Member of Parliament in Brussels Em@@ manu@@ el De Bo@@ ck , who speaks of the &apos; surge &apos; of the capital and calls for the &apos; resignation &apos; of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els .
&apos;@@ Not content to spend money from Brussels in the operations of re@@ connec@@ ting the po@@ les of sign@@ alling to the col@@ ours of the Brussels R@@ é@@ g@@ ime , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els continues with the tor@@ ch of capital &apos; , Mr De Bo@@ ok In a communi@@ qu@@ é .
After his j@@ u@@ n@@ e-@@ man@@ gu@@ e-@@ black tax@@ is , she finally pain@@ ted into Brussels the po@@ les of Brussels in black and white .
According to the honourable Member , there is now &apos; no longer the difference in visual continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels &apos; .
The Brussels Conference deserves better than to see their money squ@@ an@@ dered by a C@@ D &amp; V , which itself imple@@ ments the N@@ V@@ A programme .
It is high time to stop F@@ landers &apos;s Tro@@ j@@ an H@@ or@@ se .
&apos;@@ To recall , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els was elected only with 2 2@@ 45 votes or 0.5 % of Brussels &apos; ! &apos; , concluded by Mr De Bo@@ ck .

At the same price , it is also possible to acquire a hot@@ ch@@ pot@@ ch of protection manufactured in micro@@ fi@@ bre or an in@@ tra@@ -@@ ear head@@ phones .

It is already five years since my father er@@ ased the world of the living .
At the beginning , I denied his death , I was talking about him now ,
I was so afraid to forget that , or rather I did not know how I was going to go on to &apos; attend &apos; .
There is no recipe and employment to put the wall out of the in@@ visible and to return to it .
Then there are signs .
The first time it was the very strong sense of his presence on the passenger seat that I was driving .
On the other hand , a show@@ er in the middle of the night to watch his shows who is no longer leaving me , asked on the night table .
It is the image of my s@@ mil@@ ing father that brings me to my daily gest@@ ures .
Our mother left us after his exha@@ u@@ sting fight against cancer .
At least that is what I thought when I was an empty body , sc@@ attered around the hospital bed with che@@ ated flags .
Likewise , his fun@@ eral was a gl@@ orious f@@ are@@ well that focused on the sc@@ ant light of the bu@@ ff@@ ers that fram@@ ed his co@@ ff@@ in .
I thought she was a party .
L@@ it@@ tle by little , by small news or no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal events , a little ti@@ mid , somewhat wi@@ ped , she quickly came back to my mind , changing as she took his place in my thinking , which believed in m@@ our@@ ning .
Then she turned out and revealed my own fac@@ ets that I have not yet seen , m@@ asked by my relationship with her .
I therefore learned and understood that I had in no way lost the person of my mother , but simply a woman whom I did not really know , a woman who was the embo@@ di@@ ment of this person , during his stay in life .
In dying , this woman made a perfect life and liber@@ ated the person I helped , and now I have it , full and full .
This de@@ t@@ achment from my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful .
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us .
I look like my father , &apos; both in the de@@ vil and in the outside &apos; .
I have always been told that .
I never believed it at the time .
I have had difficult relations with him until he becomes old , ill .
There I was not afraid of him and I was able to love him .
One day he died .
For a long time , he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , I did not ...
He spoke to me , I was constantly encouraged , he lived my body .
I saw his hands by looking at mine , I gave him my body .
But it was never in@@ discre@@ et .
I was able to have a personal life .
It left me with my in@@ tim@@ acy .
It lasted for a long time and then he left .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged , advised .
I do not know who said that the dead are not forgotten , but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer but I see them constantly .
Every event , every moment of my life makes me feel that I am here , because I always refer to it : what would they have said ?
I am constantly dre@@ aming of them , perhaps not all the ni@@ ghts but several times a week .
I often dream of the last moment I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this moment .
I often wake up to the an@@ gu@@ ish that I have , and I have a profound feeling that I am not here .
Sometimes , some dreams are about me and they are part of my history , and indeed they continue to live and share my life .
The day before I was informed of the sex of my baby , I dre@@ am@@ t that I would wake up , I was d@@ row@@ ning out of bed , my father expected me to be on the table and s@@ mil@@ ed and rejo@@ ic@@ ed that I would expect a little bo@@ y .
The next day , I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sle@@ ep to tell me that he was happy to agree with me .
And , of course , it was a little bo@@ y in my wom@@ b .
I wanted to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell this shared memory lived after his death .
Five years ago , my grand@@ mother died as a result of cancer .
One year on , she was on travel with my family in Cuba .
It was a shock to me that his dem@@ ise caused me to die at the time .
Despite everything , I have done my m@@ our@@ ning quite quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , especially when I find myself in difficulties , or when I have to take important decisions .
To learn from the Arab world and to take an interest in the Middle East , to the point of making it a m@@ ast@@ ed in a major school , has not , with the hin@@ d@@ sight , been an@@ od@@ y@@ ne choices .
In fact , I often hear it about Arab@@ ic in my childhood , and talking about Morocco , where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values that she in@@ tim@@ ates me are still present , so I sometimes think that she would like me to take action at some point .
The same applies to my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and righ@@ te@@ ousness of the spirit that was a fer@@ vent beli@@ ever .
From now on , I feel it is a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent soul , a sal@@ u@@ tary spirit .
I see his view on me .
My mother died nine@@ teen years ago .
After speaking to me on the telephone .
I have gone through all the phases : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , pain , be@@ aches that are unle@@ ashing on their own , anywhere , at any time , in in@@ sol@@ vent places , at in@@ con@@ gr@@ uous moments .
Then time has cal@@ med the pain .
The lack of an answer , this vacuum without a response , and the need for it , to reassure me of its gen@@ tle , has remained un@@ answered .
Yet it is there , it is silent presence , it is there and is watching me .
As I see it , every morning , he is worried about me , I see the r@@ acks that are increasing his eyes , the ri@@ p@@ ples around the li@@ ps of cigarettes , the b@@ ones that mark the day of concern .
My mother took up my face and she is looking at me every morning .
And , every morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and mother of my three children died from cancer to 43 years .
There is always a sense of protection , there is nothing serious about it .
That was his promise of pain , so we gradually learned to s@@ mile , and to pronoun@@ ce his name is no longer taboo , but a comfort .
Of course , I speak to him at night when the absence is too bad , she inv@@ ites me in my dreams when the mor@@ ale is reached .
We feel and feel protected in difficult times , and the decline of time is making us realise how much it is the conduc@@ tor of the or@@ che@@ str@@ a , and we are trying to stay on the path that it had ma@@ pped out .
If you have a very strong one , the absence of you cannot extr@@ act your heart and memories from you .
In a way , a loved one becomes your internal energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted on what he thought or what he liked .
I was not able to see his des@@ ol@@ ation and three weeks after his death , I was giving birth to a little bo@@ y .
If I have my sometimes different convictions , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his views .
I have also had problems in my work on these convictions .
As far as I am concerned , it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , and I am not going to say anything about it , and I still wonder what it will think about .
I do not know whether I have adopted his way or whether I am just like him : is it gene@@ tics ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like alter@@ -@@ e@@ go , there was no need to talk between us .
In short , it is there on a daily basis .
I feel that he is here , and that makes me happy .
It is almost 30 years since my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old .
The immense sentence which then inv@@ aded me , of course , has been mitig@@ ated , but it is always close to me .
Very often it is &apos; lan@@ ded &apos; in my dreams in such a precise way , so vi@@ vi@@ d and even more sad to see that it was only a dream .
The other night , he asked me if I was going well , I told him no , he replied &apos; I am des@@ cen@@ ding &apos; , but a voice so real that I wo@@ ke up , an@@ gu@@ ished and I swit@@ ched the lam@@ p of hor@@ ses by watching everywhere , convinced that he was going . That is what we are going to achieve .
I still live in the same house , and often I feel observed and I am returning to see whether he is not here , I know that he is and I am speaking to him .
In all the pieces , I feel that he is here , and that makes me happy .
For nothing to the world , I would leave this house where we were happy and the spirit with me .
I am 58 years old , I have always lived on the basis of his departure , he is and will remain the love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am soci@@ alized with a profession of responsibility , I am aware , I am a grand@@ mother , I am a grand@@ mother , full of friends , but my heart and soul belongs to him and I never speak for him except my son , and I will never go to the c@@ eme@@ tery .
Iraq : October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month since 2008 .
October was the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008 .
On Friday , Baghdad published the official figures : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month : 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers .
This publication is taking place on the day that the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the President of the United States .

&apos;@@ We do not say to the world to be on our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , said Al@@ -@@ M@@ ali@@ ki this Thursday in Washington .
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved , it will spread , and what is happening in Syria will also spread .
And what happens when a terrorist virus spre@@ ads .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
O@@ ut@@ side the building , demonstrators prote@@ sted against the Iraqi leader .
They had plac@@ ards who , among others , accuse him of being a murde@@ rer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide aid .

The lawyer , who was called &apos; Bas@@ h &apos; and considered by criminals to be regarded as an &apos; important dossier &apos; , was arrested at home in 2011 as a result of listening operations by the police to S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials have re@@ pen@@ ted Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 years , to lo@@ dge three bag@@ s of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e at the home of the lawyer in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , when he was attending a Bar@@ re@@ au din@@ ner with colleagues .
Sur@@ ve@@ ys revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of a class A drug after tests showed co@@ c@@ ain@@ e tr@@ acks in his ha@@ ir , in his portfolio and his credit cards .
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he has sought illegal information on the arrest of two men for S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough and one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in the coun@@ ties of Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ si@@ de , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
Together with 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for a £ 1.5 M sum , as well as more than £ 200 000 in cash in a series of ra@@ ids .
Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to the criminals , because he feared that his drug drug would be exposed to the light of day .
Today , in the court of Li@@ ver@@ pool , Di@@ t@@ ta , who works in the For@@ bes Solidarity cabinet in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , fell by the w@@ ay@@ side after being found guilty on two charges of impe@@ di@@ ment to justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He had admitted co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators followed the suspect and re@@ counted him at the home of Di@@ t@@ ta and putting drug drugs at 60 % , at the lawyer &apos;s du@@ st@@ bin in a black gol@@ f .
So@@ on after the deposit , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta who was at a din@@ ner at the E@@ wo@@ o@@ d Par@@ k football stad@@ ium , the Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n Ro@@ c C@@ lu@@ b .
The lawyer has returned home , discovered the drugs , and they have tele@@ ph@@ oned them nine times .
The court heard that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests showed trac@@ es of a class A drug into his ha@@ ir , his portfolio , and his credit cards .
L@@ it@@ ta was arrested later , but denied co@@ c@@ ain@@ e ; he said that he had spoken to the suspected drug , because that was his cli@@ ent and argued that their discussions were subject to a &apos; legal privilege &apos; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards , but all of them were seized and a ch@@ or@@ us of ha@@ ir was taken away .
In an inter@@ rog@@ ation , he said that he poss@@ esses an office in his home , as well as in his place of work , and that it was possible for customers to call him at home for legal matters .
But the court heard evidence that he called on major players in the drug trade , some of whom were represented , after key arrests of the investig@@ ators who knew about it .
The prosecutor , An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te , said : ‘ If someone is to know that the law should not be violated , it is a criminal lawyer ’ .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal lawyer , and of getting too involved with particular customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking , but a drug deal@@ er providing drugs for his own lawyer .
Some of its communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer .
But it went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
It has hindered the police investigation as much as it has been able to carry out its criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not honour his profession , but he did not honour it .
It has come too close to some customers , particularly S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and has allowed its independence to be compromised .
Di@@ t@@ ta denied any illegal ag@@ itation and said : &apos; If I were a corrupt lawyer , I am not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not have waited 15@@ .@@ 00 , I would have done so immediately . &apos;
But , after the hearing , Le@@ e H@@ alli@@ ad of the Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re Policy said : “ Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has passed from a criminal lawyer to a criminal person as soon as he has begun to acquire drugs from criminal organisations . ”
His addiction to co@@ c@@ ain@@ e has been compromised forever and made it vulnerable to the ul@@ ter@@ ior motives of the leaders of the organised criminal groups who have asked him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .
L@@ aw@@ yers should observe the stric@@ test integrity rules and create a climate of confidence among the public .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has betra@@ yed this confidence and tried to hide behind the ven@@ e@@ er of his profession .
The unit responsible for serious and organised crime in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re led the investigation into Mr Di@@ t@@ ta , who was found guilty of the three charges for co@@ c@@ ain@@ e possession and now an obstacle to justice , demonstrating his commitment to prosecu@@ ting criminals in the courts .
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will bring you before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after having ple@@ aded guilty to complicity in trafficking hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in the traffic have been sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years in prison for drug trafficking .
On his site , Di@@ t@@ ta organised a questions / answer session on himself in which he said that his dream y@@ o@@ b would be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his latest invitation to din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali and inequality would be what motiv@@ ates him . to work .

L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Air@@ port evac@@ uated after a sho@@ oting
A sho@@ oting took place at the international airport in L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es .
It was 10@@ 00 in the morning when a man opened fire .
According to the local police , there would be at least 2 injured .
This would be an employee working for the US Transport Safety Administration ( T@@ SA ) and the perpetr@@ ator .
The incident would have occurred in ter@@ minal 3 , causing a wave of panic .
The travellers and the staff went to the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts or to the tar@@ ma@@ c .
The police quickly intervened , and a man suspected of being the sho@@ e was ap@@ prehen@@ ded on the ro@@ of of a par@@ k at the airport .
The airport is being evac@@ uated and air traffic is interrupted .
The C@@ l@@ assi@@ fication of ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ents
Each time , it is the school cli@@ en@@ te@@ le that will be targeted , an initiative that was very successful during the previous season .
Through five s@@ ay@@ n@@ et@@ ten and interpreted by artists in the region , stic@@ kers with a high do@@ se of hum@@ our are allowing teen@@ ag@@ ers to learn the classi@@ cal s@@ ong .
In addition to this spectac@@ le , the Kingdom &apos;s ly@@ ric@@ al ar@@ ts of art will be coming back with its ly@@ ric@@ al D@@ est@@ nation , a formula that is now h@@ itting the P@@ ul@@ per@@ ie of Shi@@ c@@ um@@ i .
Two other consultations will take place in the summer of 2014 , giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of .
To these activities has been added the ly@@ ric@@ al Ap@@ pe@@ al , the concer@@ t-@@ profit concer@@ tation of August last year , with the assistance of the so@@ pri@@ ano col@@ or Mari@@ e-@@ E@@ ve M@@ und@@ ger .
It was a benefit , along with the artistic dimension , and it helped the no@@ t-@@ for-@@ profit body to produce a financial balance sheet that is as swe@@ et as an air in the m@@ ouse .
Without giving specific figures , the Chairman of the Adminis@@ tra@@ tive Board , Y@@ ves Ber@@ ger@@ on , took advantage of yesterday &apos;s press meeting in Shi@@ c@@ um@@ i to be reassuring .
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions , the future is taking shape , even in the long term .
We have more solid and consistent support .
&apos;@@ The finances are af@@ lo@@ at and we hope to last until the 50@@ th anniversary of the com@@ ic oper@@ a , which we will take in seven years &apos; time &apos; , has commented on the adminis@@ tr@@ ator .
&apos;@@ I would even go beyond &apos; , added the Director-General , H@@ é@@ l@@ è@@ ne G@@ au@@ d@@ ra@@ ult , by s@@ mil@@ ing .
The 3@@ 7-@@ year-old man who took a child hostage to the G@@ ab@@ ri@@ el@@ le Ro@@ y of Sur@@ rey is facing six charges , according to Canada &apos;s Ro@@ yal G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
Om@@ ar Mu@@ stag@@ a H@@ ass@@ an has been accused of hostage taking , kidn@@ ap@@ ping , threats , a weapon in a dangerous design , kidn@@ ap@@ ping , and failing to comply with an order .
&apos;@@ The rapid reaction of the polic@@ emen involved and their ability to def@@ use the situation immediately were essential to the security conclusion of this incident &apos; , declared Corpor@@ al Ber@@ t P@@ qu@@ et by way of communi@@ qu@@ é .
Om@@ ar H@@ ass@@ an is still in detention and will have to run in court on Friday .
A New request for collective redress against the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ Cross bro@@ thers
A new request for collective redress has been tabled against the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ Cross bro@@ thers , with regard to sexual assa@@ ults that would have taken place this time in the Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h , as well as in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the testi@@ mony of the peti@@ tion@@ er , who was identified as &apos; J@@ . J &apos; . This would have been hidden in the 195@@ 0s , first in No@@ i@@ e-@@ des@@ -@@ Ne@@ i@@ ges by his prof@@ essor , the bro@@ ther , Sou@@ put , and then by his conf@@ er , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , on the or@@ ch@@ ard . Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h , where he was used as a mass , and his father worked as pain@@ tings .
The first resort was only three institutions , and when we announced the Rules of Procedure , many people told us : &apos; I was there , I can take it ? &apos; , tell the Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ra@@ t , who defends the victims in both cases .
The feature of the collective redress that has just been tabled is that it will allow complain@@ ants to be added to any institution where abuses could have been carried out by members of the S@@ e@@ te@@ -@@ Cross cong@@ reg@@ ation .
At the moment , the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sain@@ t-@@ Cross bro@@ thers have been brought together .
The alleged facts are usually older than those mentioned in the first appeal , as several of the institutions were closed in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also underlines the fact that the congestion of Sain@@ t Cross and Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h , which is a separate entity , &apos; have enabled sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &apos; , that they &apos; have had a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &apos; , that they were &apos; Know@@ ing and suff@@ oc@@ ating sexual abuse , they have &apos; know@@ ingly and consci@@ ously chosen to ignore the problem &apos; .
The latest accusations are based , among other things , on letters by the lawyer for the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ Cross bro@@ thers , M@@ e E@@ mile Per@@ ri@@ in , in the 1990s , but also by the research in the archi@@ ves on this subject by the bro@@ ther Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy , a former s@@ ister of Sain@@ t C@@ . They have publicly denounced the abuses .
Col@@ lec@@ tive redress must first take the stage of ad@@ mis@@ sibility in a higher court .
Once the Court ad@@ mits the ad@@ mis@@ sibility , the second step is taken , or the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first appeal , the congestion of the Sain@@ t Cross had agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ ably before the hearings were carried out .
Car@@ rying out a fire in a trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the r@@ ound@@ about in La@@ is@@ le , Mon@@ tre@@ al , on the night of Thursday to Friday .
Re@@ li@@ ef was called to 1.@@ 00 , on Friday , owing to a fire that declared on the sub@@ soil of a restaur@@ ant restaur@@ ant in India on the aven@@ ue to D@@ ol@@ l@@ ard , near the inter@@ section with R@@ ann@@ e .
The 30 fi@@ re-@@ fighters who have been des@@ pat@@ ched to the scene have taken almost an hour to control the bra@@ ke .
Fir@@ e has &apos; caused significant damage to the structure of the building &apos; , made it clear to the Mon@@ tre@@ al fire service , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in the restaur@@ ant when the fire@@ men arrived on the scene .
There have been no injuries , but almost 20 homes , located in the first and second flo@@ ors of this commercial premises , had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross has been asked for , because the residents of one of the flat@@ s may have to be temporarily f@@ iled , have indicated the S@@ I@@ M .
Many opposition to medical aid to die in Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care
The Canadian pal@@ lia@@ tive Congress , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical aid to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
This is an opportunity for a number of pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering , as well as being able to stay at home , very few would like to put an end to their days , according to a speaker of the Canadian Association of pal@@ lia@@ tives , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ é@@ et .
If the emphasis was placed on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the approach to eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia would become minimal .
The president of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ’ s pal@@ lia@@ tive care network also rejects the proposed law on medical assistance to die .
If it is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ é@@ ry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations .
&apos;@@ What is the sense of life &apos; , deplo@@ res .
The majority of pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses will refuse to help patients to die , according to the Vice-@@ Chairman of the Alliance of pal@@ lia@@ tives , Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne F@@ it@@ z@@ br@@ ack .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ br@@ ack , who is also the head of the Ma@@ thi@@ eu@@ -@@ Franc@@ is S@@ avo@@ y in G@@ ati@@ in@@ au , believes that the service would in any case be unnecessary .
We never ask ourselves : &apos; I want to die , give me an injec@@ tion &apos; .
The director of On@@ tari@@ o ’ s Association for pal@@ lia@@ tives , R@@ ick Fir@@ th , believes that Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ’ s bill dis@@ ori@@ des the population with regard to the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He does not believe that the On@@ tari@@ o will follow .
For its part , the Liberal , Mr St@@ é@@ ph@@ an@@ ia V@@ all@@ a , is saying that the term &apos; end of life &apos; will have to be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press is un@@ worthy of controversial media law .
&apos;@@ It is a frigh@@ tening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question : what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow ? &apos; , said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and calling for it to be declared un@@ constitutional .
“ This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and highly p@@ uni@@ tive , and we reject it , ” explained that C@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ u , managing director of Capital Group – the owner of Cap@@ it@@ al@@ F@@ M , one of the most respected news radio stations and websites in Kenya .
He said that the new media court &apos; will always be biased because it is an extension of the government &apos; and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
‘ I hope that the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to the Members of Parliament ’ , he added .
According to the newspaper The Sta@@ r , the new draft law will allow the government to have &apos; the control of the media &apos; . It is d@@ rac@@ onian &apos; .
Ad@@ option of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the West@@ g@@ ate commercial center last September .
The Ken@@ yan media have aw@@ ak@@ ened the authorities ’ anger by dissem@@ inating images of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as on which the troops deployed on the attack allegedly ste@@ ered the luxury commercial center .
The police chief , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ ye@@ o , has responded by conven@@ ing two journalists and a media official to question them , although the con@@ vocation was withdrawn as a result of the out@@ cry in the media .
Under the new draft law , the media can be subject to fines of up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being ‘ radi@@ ated ’ or of no longer being able to receive official press acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the goods of a offen@@ der if it has not paid a fine .
According to the D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , “ Even one fine is enough to paraly@@ se most F@@ M stations . ”
He also says that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the “ anim@@ ated blo@@ go@@ sphere ” of Kenya .
By si@@ len@@ cing the media , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
&quot; No one will ever know , &quot; wrote Mu@@ tu@@ a Ma@@ thi@@ u , a journalist to The N@@ ation , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of control in public life .
“ Li@@ ves to themselves , politicians would fail the country and take us back to hunting and to k@@ it@@ ch@@ en . ”
Ken@@ yan legislators have been the target of people ’ s anger in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the National Commission ’ s cuts in charge of wages , and restored their all-@@ out wages of around 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month , which are among the highest in the world .
A H@@ az@@ ardous Year of P@@ harm@@ ac@@ ists
The departure of almost 10 pharmac@@ ists at the Social Health and Social Services Centre ( S@@ S ) of L@@ av@@ al has caused a great deal of exc@@ itement about the Ci@@ clu@@ -@@ Health Ho@@ sp@@ ital , and this in the year 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
As a result of multiple retirement , maternity or depar@@ t@@ mental leave , the P@@ harm@@ ac@@ ist department has found itself to be highly defici@@ ent in terms of staff .
It l@@ acked almost 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , according to the head of the department , G@@ illi@@ an Be@@ au@@ d@@ and .
However , the S@@ S@@ S has decided not to employ an independent workforce , which can cost up to three times as much as a full-@@ time , full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist .
There was no use of the breakdown , explained Mrs Be@@ au@@ d@@ et .
Some of our activities have been stream@@ lined or reduced within the establishment in order to make up for the time .
It is certain that we have worked hard to get our young people to come and stay here and stay here .
There is a competition of circumstances that has led to a bad situation last year .
Im@@ proved situation
After this difficult period , 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 will be much easier for the S@@ S@@ S pharm@@ acy department .
Three pharm@@ acies are already returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharm@@ acies have been hi@@ red in recent months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to retain it have borne fruit , because the four pupils present in L@@ av@@ al have also decided to remain in the S@@ S@@ S employment .
Now it is much better , highlighted the pharm@@ acy .
By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity returns .
This will therefore make up for our depar@@ tures from last year .
R@@ est@@ less B@@ est
The situation , however , remains a delicate one .
Several factors , such as the shortage of hospital pharmac@@ ists or a predomin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because we have a young environment and many young women are employed , so with pregnan@@ cies , there are almost always three maternity leave leave when it goes well , she added .
The last year has had much more , and there are no pharmac@@ ists who are available to replace it , so it was more difficult .
The 2@@ 2-@@ year-old to@@ p does not start its career in the cinema by the back door .

St@@ ud@@ y Martin ’ s resemb@@ l@@ ance to his el@@ dest el@@ dest is striking : a sil@@ ver in the wind , a di@@ ap@@ h@@ an@@ ane , and Franco-@@ English origins .
Let us not forget a certain sense of risk : that which had not hesit@@ ated to put g@@ lu@@ ed on g@@ los@@ sy paper is going to be seen in a situation that is far more sul@@ li@@ ous on a large scre@@ en .
An extr@@ act from N@@ y@@ m@@ om@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ c raised the temperature on the To@@ le : St@@ ain@@ y Martin appeared there in the ex@@ po@@ t with Shi@@ a La@@ Be@@ ou@@ f .
If the provoc@@ ative fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker has asked his actors to put their fin@@ gers on the shel@@ f , he has resor@@ ted to X professionals for the most o@@ dious scenes of sex , before mer@@ ging all the bodies num@@ er@@ ically : above the bel@@ t , it is the star ; below , the pain .

From B@@ j@@ ör@@ k to Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg , by way of Nic@@ o@@ le K@@ id@@ man , L@@ ars von T@@ ri@@ er used to push his cr@@ ack@@ ers , always for the better .
Mr Martin has not finished talking about it .
A room for N@@ ar@@ good evac@@ u@@ e@@ es on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening , the first sitting of a film was interrupted to the M@@ a CM@@ R in N@@ ar@@ bon@@ a , as a precautionary measure , following the thro@@ ats felt by the spec@@ t@@ ators .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , the director was evac@@ uated from the Chamber and warned the fire bri@@ g@@ ades for a suspect sm@@ ell .
Ab@@ out 70 people have emerged from the sitting .
People were examined and full recognition of the Chamber did not do anything .
Is it a jo@@ ke on the te@@ ar of te@@ ar j@@ et ?
Or an invol@@ un@@ tary incident ?
Nevertheless , the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients .
The room has been put on the back bur@@ ner and everything has been put in order .
The cinema has been able to take up its rights and customers have been able to regain the pleasure of the pictures .
Only on scre@@ ens .
It is trying to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into cement .
Taking advantage of the H@@ all@@ we@@ en Day , a woman tried to bring two k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into the country hidden away in cement tanks , on Thursday morning , at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ u airport .
It was during the examination of passenger lu@@ gg@@ age that drugs could be detected .
The co@@ c@@ ain@@ e was distributed in three c@@ ages in advance .
The drug was then transported to the Canada Ro@@ yal G@@ end@@ er@@ mer@@ ie ( G@@ R@@ C ) office , which took over in this investigation .
The Canadian B@@ order Services Agency ( SA@@ F@@ C ) did not show where the woman arrived when she was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
This is part of the investigation , indicating J@@ acqu@@ e-@@ Rob@@ y , spokes@@ person for the AS@@ F@@ C .
What I can tell you is that it is coming to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border services at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ u Air@@ port have carried out 17@@ 3 drugs se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 co@@ c@@ ain@@ e se@@ iz@@ ures for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , the border services of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region made a total of 16@@ 53 drug se@@ iz@@ ures .
Air@@ lines against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A ship@@ ment of short-@@ range SA@@ -@@ 8 air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new ra@@ id in the aviation of Syrian territory on Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz ) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria .
The ra@@ id took place in roughly the same circumstances as the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an an@@ onymous American official who had confirmed to the C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack , this time on the &apos; Y@@ ak@@ h@@ t &apos; missiles , delivered by Russia in Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Israeli officials had not hidden their irrit@@ ation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond .
Ukraine \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s B@@ om@@ b
On Friday , the rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ or@@ ne low@@ ered the solvency rating of Ukraine , calling into question the capacity of the former Soviet Republic , which has been in recession for over a year , to face up to its financial obligations .
The note of the country &apos;s public debt is going to &apos; B@@ - &apos; , sin@@ king into the category of speculative investments .
It has a negative prospect , S &amp; P , which sees at least one chance in three that it is again down@@ gra@@ ded in a year ’ s time .
&apos;@@ It is becoming less and less likely that the government &apos;s strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs &apos; explains the US agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine ’ s foreign-@@ exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 , and that the trend will continue .
This makes it difficult for money to be re@@ paid abroad .
These reserves , which the authorities use mas@@ sively to support the local currency , the h@@ ry@@ v@@ nia , collap@@ sing , the agency is increasingly likely to de@@ value , which would increase its external debt .
Ki@@ ev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia , which acc@@ uses it of not having paid a bill of USD 8@@ 82 million .
This announcement is bad news for Ukraine ’ s power in a period of deep tension with Russia ’ s neighb@@ or , fu@@ rious about Ki@@ ev ’ s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had been in its fifth quarter of contr@@ action between July and September .
Its relatively modest debt has explo@@ ded in recent years and S &amp; P estimates of 3@@ 3.5 % of GDP , compared to less than 10 % before the 2008-@@ 2009 crisis .
For months , the country , with its budget deficit , has been calling for aid from the International Monetary Fund , which had granted it a credit of USD 15@@ .@@ 3 billion in 2010 , and at the moment has only made it EUR 3.@@ 4 billion .
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tran@@ che until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , notably by raising gas prices to the population .
After a new failed mission in the country , the IMF this week noted that &quot; the important external financing needs &quot; were &quot; vulnerability &quot; , while &quot; signs of economic improvement &quot; .
However , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r Jo@@ ou@@ d of the C@@ enter for Political Stu@@ dies , &apos; we cannot wait for a short-term improvement &apos; .
&apos;@@ There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-@@ election year &apos; , since the presidential elections are due to be held in 2015 , is the expert who questioned the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
In addition , S &amp; P notes the &apos; uncertainty &apos; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which Brussels is dependent on for the release of the opposition Yu@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
&apos;@@ Sign@@ ing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade , but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium terms linked to Russia &apos;s reaction &apos; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &apos; trade restrictions &apos; from Moscow .
Russia , which represents a quarter of Ukraine &apos;s exports , warned that , in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Ki@@ ev , it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods .
America ’ s Green F@@ light to the P@@ u@@ b@@ ric@@ is@@ -@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m merger
Pub@@ lic@@ ation and Om@@ ni@@ co@@ m have said on Friday that they have not had any objections from the US authorities to their merger , moving closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency .
Fu@@ sion brings the second world agency , Om@@ ni@@ co@@ m , closer , and the third is public .
&apos; Ol@@ ni@@ m Group and Public Pub@@ lic@@ ation Group have today announced the expiry of the period of examination of the previously announced merger of the Public Pro@@ per@@ is Group and announced by the Har@@ t-@@ S@@ co@@ t@@ t-@@ Ro@@ d@@ ino An@@ ti@@ tr@@ us@@ t Im@@ pro@@ tr@@ us@@ u@@ t Im@@ pro@@ vement Act of 197@@ 6 , as amended &apos;@@ It is the two groups who announce in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
They specify that they have also received the necessary permits in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the review period provided for by the H@@ S@@ R in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other juris@@ dic@@ tions meet several of the conditions necessary for the operation of the operation .
&apos;@@ Fu@@ sion is also conditional on the acquisition of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups &apos; , they add .
The Congolese army hun@@ t the M@@ 23 rebels
The Congolese army ( F@@ AR@@ DC ) announced on Thursday that its units would cha@@ se the M@@ 23 rebels into their bases in the forests and mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u bordering Rwanda and Uganda .
M@@ 23 is about to be beaten after being driven out of the towns in the north-@@ east of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) that he has been controlling since the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insur@@ gency .
&apos;@@ We are going to carry on with the M@@ 23 and drive it wherever it hi@@ des because it is criminals &apos; , said in Re@@ u@@ ters the Col@@ on@@ el O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokes@@ person for the F@@ ARC .
We must not allow them to re@@ organise themselves because they have been mar@@ ty@@ red by the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring peace .
M@@ 23 officials explained that they had evac@@ uated the loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure , and Ber@@ tr@@ and B@@ is@@ sim@@ wa , the politician of the re@@ bel@@ lion , said on the subject of re@@ bel@@ lion that these military set@@ backs would not alter his demands for peace talks .
The latter , according to the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , resumed in K@@ amp@@ ala between the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 on Wednesday .
T@@ ran@@ si@@ ties are reported in the h@@ ills that dominate B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the last town in the hands of the insur@@ gents to fall this week , as well as around R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a h@@ ill in which the M@@ 23 re@@ bel@@ lion came into being in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , the head of the province of North Ki@@ v@@ u , taking advantage of the le@@ ak of government gar@@ ris@@ on and p@@ assi@@ vity of the UN ’ s blue hel@@ me@@ ts .
The fall of G@@ om@@ a led the United Nations Mission in the DR@@ C , the world ’ s largest in terms of man@@ power , to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention bri@@ g@@ ade made up of South African troops , mal@@ a@@ ise and T@@ anz@@ anian troops .
For its part , the F@@ ARC headquarters was re@@ worked , and the army went on the offensive against M@@ 23 , causing war to change .
The rate of progress of government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;@@ M@@ 23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predicted a Congolese business expert , J@@ as@@ on Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Si@@ as@@ a .
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa managed to beat a major insur@@ gency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda is present in the east of the DR@@ C .
Experts from the United Nations blame Rwanda , which is fier@@ cely den@@ i@@ grated , to support milit@@ arily on M@@ 23 , which was made up of former muti@@ l@@ ated Congolese soldiers .
British diplomacy , Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , invited Rw@@ and@@ an President Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to show restraint , announced a spokes@@ person for the Foreign Office .
Last week , K@@ ig@@ ali referred to the possibility of military re@@ pris@@ als following sh@@ ell@@ s falling into Rw@@ and@@ an territory .
On Wednesday , the inhabitants of B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana inv@@ aded the streets of the bour@@ g@@ ade to welcome the entry of the F@@ ARC soldiers .
&apos;@@ We lived a year with M@@ 23 , and it seemed un@@ imagin@@ able to be liber@@ ated by the army one day &apos; , which testi@@ fies to an inhabit@@ ant of this local town of Uganda .
&apos;@@ We lived in terror ( of M@@ 23 ) , we are tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tised &apos; , and added this man .
The tests carried out by the Pa@@ ste@@ ur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the cor@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ us were negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &apos; the two cases identified in May 2013 are therefore the only two cases confirmed in France to date &apos; .
On Tuesday , this 43 year-old patient was suspected of being reached , having returned from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already claimed fifty lives .
Ch@@ ev@@ ron , the second American oil company , reported on Friday of a fall in its quar@@ terly benefit due to the fall in its refin@@ ing margins , while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in line with the group ’ s objectives .
Its net third-@@ quarter benefit has fallen to $ 4.@@ 95 billion , or $ 2.@@ 57 billion , compared to $ 5.@@ 25 billion , or $ 2.@@ 69 per action , one year before .
The analy@@ sts surve@@ yed by Re@@ u@@ ters aver@@ aged $ 2.@@ 71 per equity benefit .
The group produced 2.@@ 59 million bar@@ rel@@ s of oil equivalent per day during the quarter of the year , on the increase in comparison with the EUR 2.@@ 52 million produced a year ago .
Society is aiming at 2.@@ 65 million be@@ ds for this year , with a 25 % growth in output expected by 201@@ 7 .
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liqu@@ e@@ fied liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas projects in Australia .
Due to the cost of these projects , annual investment expenditure has increased by USD 7 billion in two years and is expected to reach USD 3@@ 6.@@ 7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of down@@ stream activities ( including refin@@ ing and chemical production ) fell by 45 % to 3@@ 80 million dollars .
This reduction in refin@@ ing margins affects the sector as a whole .
Ch@@ ev@@ ron ’ s main competi@@ tor , Ex@@ xon Mob@@ il , reported on Thursday of a shrin@@ king net profit , despite rising gas and oil production .
Transport of school@@ children : the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year of the S@@ CA@@ F Rad@@ er@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( S@@ CA@@ R@@ S ) , there has been a demand from the beginning of the school year of $ 150 per pup@@ il ( up to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for school students to two homes , a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so . Let us do so .
Before the changes made to the last budget , no financial contribution was requested .
&apos;@@ There is a mediation service which is proposed by the committee and I was interested &apos; , explains Mrs L@@ è@@ res .
According to her , the S@@ CA@@ S@@ S was invited to mediation and it asked for a further time to reflect on it .
&apos;@@ It is always better to talk about it , to talk and find solutions &apos; , Mrs L@@ è@@ res .
The Scho@@ ol de-@@ Scho@@ ol Commission ( S@@ CA@@ R@@ S ) did not wish to comment on it .
The organisation only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint .
Im@@ ports of H@@ ail@@ -@@ God E@@ ur@@ b@@ ations
In view of the fact that some of the staff and trade unions have been fron@@ ting for months , including the G@@ F@@ T , the Minister for Health , Mar@@ is@@ ol T@@ our@@ ain@@ e , decided on 10 July &apos; to def@@ er the timetable for the implementation of the project , and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which will not be able to take place on the 4 . November &apos; .
An official request &apos; in order not to run any risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &apos; , but which was also aimed at not ham@@ per@@ ing the PS campaign for a few months from the municipal authorities .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should still be in place on that date .
Even if , in the A@@ PH@@ P , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As of 4 November , the fi@@ re-@@ fighters who guaranteed around a quarter of 40 000 annual pass@@ ages in the H@@ ab@@ el@@ -@@ God E@@ ur@@ gencies will all have received in order to take 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals .
This 4 November date also corresponds to the renewal of the inter@@ turns .
In the Ha@@ the@@ t@@ -@@ God , the in@@ siders who speci@@ alize in ur@@ gencies will be left to five members of general medicine on Monday .
With regard to the transfer of the T@@ H@@ s of internal medicine , it is scheduled for the month of this month .
&apos;@@ The H@@ ast@@ el@@ -@@ God emergency service must close as soon as possible , and for us it is 4 November &apos; , without de@@ tr@@ acting from Lo@@ c Cap@@ on , the Chairman of the A@@ P@@ I , the Chairman of the A@@ P@@ I , who supports the direction of the management . .
&apos;@@ On 4 November , there will be no patients brought up by the fire@@ men , only people from their own means &apos; , confirming Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical leader of the new Hy@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God .
&apos;@@ But we will continue to receive emergency patients &apos; , does he temp@@ t the permanent presence of S@@ M@@ U@@ R vehicles on site to transfer serious cases .
There are senior doctors who are sen@@ i@@ ors who will stay there , and he is also making sure that this is the case .
But it is up to the L@@ R@@ A to decide to close the emergency reception service .
&apos;@@ Things are being done gradually &apos; , according to Nicol@@ as Pé@@ j@@ u , spokes@@ person for the L@@ R@@ A for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in terms of service &apos; .
&quot; The minister li@@ ed to us or was li@@ ed to us , &quot; deplo@@ res the doctor ’ s doctor , General Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek .
D@@ em@@ on@@ str@@ ation of the head of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R at the beginning of July for having taken the fron@@ t@@ line against the re@@ organization project is defined as a &apos; wa@@ ke-up call &apos; in the face of a &apos; cynical &apos; decision taken by the &apos; medical and administrative techno@@ structure &apos; .
&apos;@@ They are in the process of emp@@ t@@ ying and suff@@ oc@@ ating emergencies which were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &apos; , does he believe .
For him , &apos; if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &apos; .
However , they are on a regular basis .
For example , there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for L@@ ari@@ b@@ is@@ i@@ ère &apos;s ur@@ gencies .
To the L@@ R@@ A , it is claimed that 30 &apos; dis@@ pat@@ ched &apos; patients on several sites are not in danger of representing an &apos; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &apos; in other emergency services , the human resources of which will also have been strengthened .
The &apos; new hosp@@ it@@ ality model &apos; , to the L@@ R@@ A as well as to the A@@ H@@ P , has been advocated since 7 October and should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , general liberal doctors should also come to participate in the establishment of &apos; permanent care &apos; .
&apos;@@ Where are we going to ask people to diagno@@ se themselves &apos; , ask themselves Gen@@ er@@ a Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek for whom the &apos; not serious emergency &apos; concept is &apos; dangerous &apos; and marks a &apos; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &apos; .
This is going to happen as in the case of Level 3 maternity hospitals .
People are not mad , they will go where there is the best provision of care .
If the Minister does not take a measure by Monday , we are going to change the s@@ way , predic@@ ting Chris@@ top@@ her P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , an emergency medical doctor and a member of the G@@ T@@ C@@ T .
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to think about presenting a list .
In N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e K@@ os@@ ci@@ us@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ oriz@@ et &apos;s team , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , the U@@ M@@ P coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in Paris and elected from the 4@@ th En@@ ter@@ prise , clearly announ@@ ces that &apos; even if the U@@ M@@ P Paris was in favour of maintaining ur@@ gencies in the Ho@@ ly God , it would be technically possible to do this . It is financially impossible to reopen them if we are responsible &apos; .
On Monday morning , An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the PS candidate , once again reminded France of the fact that it declared itself in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark its clear disagreement , point B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , his spokesman .
Even though the restructuring of the Ha@@ the@@ t@@ -@@ God has its legitimacy in terms of substance , we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama ’ s IMF and World Bank S@@ wi@@ ft
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to end the inter@@ c@@ eption of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicates a US official , Thursday .
This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to take over the hands of the N@@ SA after the re@@ vel@@ ations made by former analy@@ st Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , a refugee in Russia .
This is the first time that the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began .
When asked about the subject , a US administration official replied : “ The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance aimed at the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington . ”
In the name of an@@ onym@@ ity , this responsibility did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past .
Another official has said that Barack Obama has ordered that these practices be brought to an end in the past weeks .
This in@@ struction was given more or less at the same time as that brought to the end of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , the Sen@@ ator of the Int@@ elli@@ gence Commission has approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday , but has allowed them to continue .
The committee has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now set to work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals ( M@@ DGs ) , which were put in place 12 years ago to combat world poverty .
Austr@@ ali@@ an diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “ sustainable development goals ” intended to replace the M@@ DGs , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began in Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They were in the final preliminary draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to “ overcome national interests . ”
&apos;@@ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting objectives for universal sustainable development ( O@@ DA ) , &apos; , has added .
These O@@ D@@ Cs will be based on the progress made in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the M@@ DGs .
The security concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as there is conflict between powerful person@@ alities .
In the stat@@ ue of the stat@@ ue of S@@ began M@@ ach@@ el , Mozambique &apos;s founding president , thousands of people gathered in the centre of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to to chan@@ t peaceful slog@@ ans at a rare public demonstration .
‘ We want peace to return ; we want stability ’ , said V@@ an@@ ess@@ a de Sou@@ ous@@ a , direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of an investment company .
In@@ qu@@ et for the future of his country , she exchanged work clo@@ thes against a T@@ -@@ shir@@ t bearing the name &apos; we want security &apos; in Portuguese before joining the crow@@ ded crow@@ d on the capital place of the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there have been almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and Ren@@ <unk> , the worst se@@ iz@@ ures since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago .
Ren@@ <unk> was once a famous rebel movement , supported initially by wh@@ ites ’ R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia , and then by South Africa ’ s apar@@ theid government as part of the effort to destabili@@ ze the country ’ s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
An@@ aly@@ sts believe that the country should not rel@@ ap@@ se into open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
There is a great deal at stake for the growing economy , as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the north-@@ west could attract more than $ 50 M@@ d of investment over the next few years from companies like Rio T@@ into , V@@ ale of Brazil , Italy , Italy , and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko The United States .
The Fo@@ re@@ m@@ o , the governing party and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and the Ren@@ n@@ <unk> blame each other , blame each other for tensions .
Ren@@ <unk> says that the government is at the root of the recent clashes , and that it has launched an attack on its members in the province of So@@ fa@@ la , a traditional str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of the Ren@@ d , on October 17 .
The assa@@ ults on former rebels then de@@ generated when government forces attacked the bases of the Ren@@ <unk> and tried to kill A@@ f@@ on@@ so D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the group leader , and Fer@@ nan@@ do Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , the speaker of the Ren@@ <unk> , according to the Financial Times .
The government is making the Ren@@ <unk> responsible responsible for the conflict , and acc@@ using him of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to minimise concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za said on Wednesday , in the French press agency , that Mr D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama regarded himself as a &apos; los@@ er &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government &apos; .
Fo@@ re@@ m@@ o and Ren@@ <unk> <unk> insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern grew after Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that the Ren@@ d was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .
He said in the F@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the F@@ eder@@ o .
‘ We want to resume negotiations , but with the greatest seriousness ’ , Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
Pre@@ vious talks between the parties have failed to alleviate the tensions fu@@ elled by a series of conflicts this year .
“ These are two great men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who don ’ t stop arguing , ” Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ an@@ on , a conf@@ erring of Mozambique ’ s open and specialist university , has explained .
None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them are prepared to make the necessary concessions .
Ren@@ <unk> , who is in favour of electoral reform , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November .
Presid@@ ential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a trea@@ sure of war on the part of the government .
R@@ ef@@ erring to the votes collected by the R@@ R@@ P has been steadily declining since 1992 , while a new party , the Mozambique Democratic Movement ( M@@ D@@ M ) , which was created by a former member of the Rena@@ iss@@ ance , should obtain more votes in elections .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – who should withdraw at the end of his second term of office next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&apos;@@ He does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency &apos; , Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Ren@@ ana is , but it has led to disrup@@ tive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-@@ south motor@@ way axis .
Most of the se@@ ams took place in the province of So@@ f@@ a , which is several hundred kilometres from the north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where Be@@ ira is , the port where mining companies , particularly Rio T@@ int@@ o and V@@ ale , export coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Ren@@ d threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was mis@@ ta@@ k@@ enly ti@@ mid when asked whether the Ren@@ <unk> would re@@ kin@@ dle this threat .
The Ren@@ <unk> wanted to “ warn the international community that things do not go well in Mozambique , ” Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a pointed out .
In@@ stability has strengthened the fru@@ stra@@ tions of the government , dec@@ la@@ res Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , Med@@ ac@@ o@@ p , to an independent media company , many people are also concerned about corruption , slow development , and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
“ People believe that those responsible for the country ’ s future are the government and the president , and that it is up to them to find solutions to the problems , ” he explained .
Om@@ ar S@@ ul@@ tu@@ ane , a manife@@ station , said that people only wanted stability .
“ No@@ -@@ one ca@@ res about Ren@@ <unk> , or from Wil@@ o , they just want to return to peace , they want free access to the roads , ” he added .
We should teach children my@@ ths and leg@@ s as &apos; lifestyle models &apos; , and declare the author .
The L@@ é@@ g@@ en@@ de de Th@@ or could show that “ the brutal force does not carry weight in the face of sub@@ tle ruin , ” while ar@@ th@@ uri@@ an le@@ gen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
In saying that many my@@ ths would be “ far too violent , far too scandalous , and in some cases far too ob@@ scene to be taught at school , ” Cro@@ s@@ s@@ le@@ y-@@ Holland advocated “ careful selection ” of age adapted to age .
&apos;@@ I think it is wonderful that , in America , the my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education &apos; , he said .
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are &apos; openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &apos; means that children &apos; get completely out &apos; , with the messages being &apos; sub@@ li@@ ed &apos; in pleasant histor@@ ies .
C@@ ros@@ sing Holland , which translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ se and wrote The Pen@@ guided Bo@@ o@@ k of Nor@@ se My@@ the@@ s , and British Gol@@ k T@@ ales , said : “ You may have good intentions , but you prefer to keep them out of sight . &apos;
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author who writ@@ es for adults and an adult writ@@ er who writ@@ es for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything should be simplified or completed , but there is an in@@ n@@ ate sense of good and evil .
And it must be sub@@ li@@ fied ; it has been revealed in a history rather than declared .
The known basis of what is being shown and is not being said .
A figh@@ ter from the armed branch of Hamas was killed this evening and another w@@ ounded by an Israeli fir@@ ing in the Gaza Strip , has been learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists were carrying out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a sh@@ ell@@ s from Israeli tanks .
The N@@ SA : the US is “ gone too far , ” it ad@@ mits to Ker@@ ry .
The US has sometimes gone too far on es@@ pion@@ age , has recognized Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in the first po@@ le@@ m@@ ic in Washington with Europe on massive data collection by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations , and den@@ i@@ als between the US and their European allies , this is the first time that an American government official has explicitly recognized controversial practices in the N@@ SA inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;@@ In some cases , I admit , as the President has done , some of these actions have gone too far , and we are going to make sure that this does not happen in the future &apos; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London in which he participated since Washington on 31 October by video link .
In his speech , in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , the head of US diplomacy has long justified intelligence practices and gathering information through the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention against possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ king the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the attacks in London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry assured us that the US authorities had had many plans for attacks , through the inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and the collection of information .
&apos;@@ We have prevented aircraft from falling , buildings do not explo@@ de and people are murdered , because we were able to be informed up@@ stream of these projects &apos; , argued the bos@@ s of American diplomacy .
And , Mr Ker@@ ry said to the Europeans , &apos; I can assure you that in this process of innocent people , it has not been mis@@ led &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;@@ And yes , in some cases it went too far in the wrong way &apos; , still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal at a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured us on Thursday evening that President Obama was &apos; intent on trying to clarify and that he carried out a review of these practices so that no one felt dec@@ eived &apos; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to grow this week with further re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted the data of hundreds of millions of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o users .
The newspaper , which c@@ ites documents obtained from the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , says that the &apos; M@@ U@@ S@@ C@@ U@@ LA@@ R &apos; programme , carried out with the UK N@@ SA counterpart , G@@ CC , allows these two agencies to recover . Data from the fi@@ b@@ res used by the Internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , some 18@@ 1 million elements were collected in January alone - from me@@ tal to e-mail , to text elements or to audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ c@@ eption would take place outside the US .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google have denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , or Italy have shown that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted massive data and communications from allies of the US and their leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states , and while lea@@ ks in the US press were saying that the US President was not aware of such listening , Barack Obama has refused to speak on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
By contrast , the bos@@ s of the powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ e@@ ith Alexander , has denied him that his intelligence agency has cap@@ tured tens of millions of European citizens ’ communications .
He even returned the European intelligence service that had seized these communications before giving them to the N@@ SA .
This would relate to &apos; military operations &apos; in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and this would not be aimed at Europe at all , said General Alexander .
And there was controversy over Asia on Friday .
Indonesia convened the Austr@@ ali@@ an Ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast network of international es@@ pion@@ age that has also sti@@ r@@ red up China .
The Paris Sain@@ t-@@ German will receive L@@ ori@@ ent Friday without his master &apos;s master , the Swed@@ e Z@@ l@@ an I@@ bra@@ im@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , is announcing the League 1 club in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
P@@ S@@ G , the leader of the World Cup in front of Mon@@ ac@@ o , in contrast to goals , broadcast the list of players held for the 12@@ th Day match , without the attack of 32 years .
The communi@@ qu@@ é simply indicates that he is &apos; w@@ ounded &apos; , without specifying the nature of the w@@ ound .
He was , however , suffering from an inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory left when he returned to selection at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony in memory of the dec@@ e@@ ased dead
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ en organised a secular ceremony at 11 a.m. in memory of all the dead who were created in his establishment during the year .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , a Socialist candidate in the town of Paris , must attend , and then explain , at a press conference , his proposals for the fun@@ eral .
To follow the ceremony , it is a c@@ lic@@ k .
For their own fun@@ eral , more and more French people choose the creation , rather than bu@@ ri@@ al : 53 % , according to an S@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people instead of 47 % .
On the other hand , the opposite is the case : the French prefer bu@@ ri@@ al ( 53 % versus 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune of losing a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his ash book The De@@ ath to the ashes , D@@ am@@ i@@ en Le Gu@@ ay , the philosop@@ her and Vice-President of the National Committee on E@@ th@@ ics E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &quot; violence &quot; that is the creation of the survi@@ v@@ ors , for the survi@@ v@@ ors .
In a very short space of time , in a very short space of time , and not after a process of dec@@ ay , which &apos; would accompany the m@@ our@@ ning phases &apos; , there is , with the cre@@ ed , &apos; violence made to the loved body &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which is based on &apos; writing off the peculi@@ arities and distingu@@ ishing signs &apos; that are reduced to the &apos; an@@ onym@@ ity &apos; of the ash .
Why is it that what is being accepted with no difficulty in some of the Nordic Pro@@ te@@ stant countries is still badly lived in France ?
&apos;@@ Because the cre@@ ed is a new fact &apos; , and Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ri@@ que B@@ ac@@ é , chair@@ person of the Socialist Society of Th@@ an@@ at@@ ology and author of the book , is calling for death .
It has only been tolerated since 196@@ 3 by the Catholic Church , which has limited attempts to aff@@ i@@ x it .
It is for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mic@@ is N@@ ér@@ ard , the head of the Paris City Service General Director of the L@@ ille of Paris , to make provision for a ceremony as dignified as the one to which he would be entitled with his bu@@ ri@@ al .
The annual survey of I@@ p@@ so@@ s shows a very strong commitment to organising the ceremony .
77 % of French people want one , for their relatives , whether they are religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
Now , 73 % of people who have chosen a cre@@ am wish to organise a ceremony .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s also wish to do so .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ a have adapted to this development of society .
&apos;@@ For ten years they have been trying to avoid the violence of an expectation , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the ash surrender &apos; , observing Mr Mic@@ ho@@ d-@@ N@@ ér@@ ard .
Seven@@ ty per cent of the establishments now offer ma@@ sters of cere@@ monies , who carry out , in the presence of the body , the following rit@@ ual : to welcome the House , to appoint the de@@ func@@ t , to link it to the others , to raise it , to give meaning to its death , to organise the f@@ are@@ well .
This is the case in the case of Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ en , who has been in office since 1998 .
The ma@@ sters of ceremony are often people who have been converted .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ en has been organising , since 2010 , the day of La La T@@ ous@@ se@@ t , several cere@@ monies of the rememb@@ r@@ ance , secular and non-@@ religious , to which he inv@@ ites the families of the people who have been created in the year .
For the second con@@ secu@@ tive year , one of these cere@@ monies is on the line , to those who could not travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um has allowed us to pass it on .
Re@@ -@@ H@@ ous@@ ing D@@ re@@ am in La Se@@ y@@ ne
At the beginning of the week , a family left his a@@ partment at the bottom of the F@@ ru@@ ti@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 building due to the presence of r@@ ats .
In the face of the urgency of the situation , the director of the South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at Office has proposed , in an exceptional and provisional manner , to reloc@@ ate the couple and his three children in a new T@@ 4 .
Yet the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons and the situation is blocked .
The case of Jo@@ in Can@@ ap@@ a , the director of the office , has assumed excessive proportions .
There have been r@@ ats , and there have always been r@@ ats in the cities .
The de@@ priv@@ ation company carries out two pass@@ ages per year , and we are also acting , at our expense , at every request from the inhabitants .
We have therefore , since the end of last winter , made 64 speeches .
The neigh@@ bor@@ hood is not left to abandon , and the r@@ ats do not pull out in the city .
For reasons of environmental protection and public health , it is only four times less effective than in the past , but for two r@@ ats we are not going to kill a taste .
&apos;@@ We have not invited the r@@ ats to us &apos; , defending the father of the family who left their homes to settle in ho@@ tel .
We are soon without a pen@@ ny , and we expect a new housing , at the same rate as the old one .

Ben Green@@ man : 10@@ th anniversary of the New York Com@@ ed@@ y F@@ es@@ ti@@ val : The New Yor@@ ker
One could say that the city of New York was the place where the stand@@ -@@ by in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the actor of vi@@ vi@@ vi@@ vi@@ a Fr@@ ank F@@ ay , who held the role of ceremony in Pal@@ ace The@@ at@@ er , on Bro@@ ad@@ way , was beginning to tell a bl@@ under . These are directly to the public , the tone of the convers@@ ation .
F@@ ay innovation has been perpetu@@ ated over the years , until the New York Fo@@ ed@@ y F@@ es@@ ti@@ val has been taken up more recently .
Cre@@ ated and over@@ seen by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ sch , the foun@@ der of the stand@@ -@@ by club , the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectac@@ les presented in small clubs and great theat@@ res .
“ Most of the post@@ ers emerged in Car@@ ol@@ ine , and had a great success , until they became too famous to play into a club , ” H@@ ir@@ sch said .
We have created this f@@ es@@ ti@@ val in order to be able to continue working with them .
The event of this year will see the participation of W@@ anda Sy@@ k@@ es , K@@ a@@ thy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in and Bill Ma@@ her and the presentation of &apos; St@@ é@@ d U@@ p for Her@@ oes &apos; , a evening of com@@ edy and music to the former combat@@ ants , organised at Mad@@ ison Square , Among other things , the B@@ ru@@ ce S@@ pr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , Ro@@ ger W@@ ad@@ ers and Bill Co@@ s@@ by will be present .
The f@@ es@@ ti@@ val has grown , as has the world of com@@ edy .
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans in this year &apos;s f@@ es@@ ti@@ val have been through non-@@ traditional cir@@ cu@@ its , for example by presenting spectac@@ les on small television channels , such as C@@ Central , F@@ X and S@@ pi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ ro@@ l@@ l has appeared on the scene in a k@@ it@@ co@@ m on a c@@ able channel ( The League of “ The League ” on the subject of F@@ X@@ X ’ s jo@@ y@@ ful fant@@ asy football ) and now has its own Com@@ ed@@ os spectac@@ le of Com@@ ed@@ os . That is the Central C@@ en@@ tury .
Jen@@ ny S@@ la@@ te took part in the “ S@@ atur@@ d@@ ay Li@@ ve ” and was part of the series of “ Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation , ” but it is more well known for his series of “ Mar@@ c@@ el the S@@ hell ” vide@@ os with S@@ ho@@ You have &apos; .
K@@ ro@@ l@@ l and S@@ la@@ te , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans to the sing@@ ular voice ( the sur@@ real pessimis@@ t An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k , the ir@@ ony of the ir@@ ony of racial justice W. K@@ am@@ u Bel@@ l ) , are pure products from the decentr@@ alized world of the US edi@@ tion .
One of the main factors of attr@@ acti@@ veness of the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val this year will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg with Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg began as a stand@@ -@@ by com@@ edy , but he became a film and film director , as well as an u@@ no@@ fficial histor@@ ian of the com@@ edy .
Between 2005 and 2007 , he anim@@ ated a TV program that was called “ S@@ it D@@ ow@@ n Com@@ ed@@ y with David Ste@@ in@@ berg . ”
The meeting is taking place at the V@@ ille of V@@ ille , in the Man@@ h@@ att@@ an centre .
“ The city is permanently in the com@@ ical DNA of all the work of Lar@@ ry , ” Ste@@ in@@ berg said .
He told me that , when he was here , he sometimes went down a ru@@ de between two buildings and said , if I lose all my money , perhaps I will live here .
Oil prices continue to fall and are close to $ 96 a bar@@ rel .
The price of oil has continued to fall on Friday , while concerns about the size of stocks outw@@ ei@@ gh a report showing that China ’ s electricity manufacturing industry is growing stronger .
The price of the US benchmark for delivery in December fell from 14 c@@ ents to $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a bar@@ rel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Ex@@ change ( N@@ Y@@ ME@@ X ) .
The contract lost 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it with a cut of 5.@@ 8 % in October .
The pl@@ enti@@ ful supply of crude oil has been on the price in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on China ’ s manufacturing sector on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China ’ s economic recovery could continue to rise after growth so@@ ared to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a decline that had not been seen for two decades in the previous quarter .
G@@ rent B@@ rent , a reference for international oil already used by American refin@@ eries , has lost 26 c@@ ents to 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ rel on the London Inter@@ -@@ Con@@ Ex@@ change ( IC@@ E ) in London .
A@@ vo@@ i@@ ding the right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as
A federal appeal court restored certain restrictions in T@@ ex@@ as to the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy which had been blocked by a judge of the first instance this week .
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in that state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The ruling by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that the doctors who will be practi@@ sing I@@ V@@ G will have to have an &apos; admission privilege &apos; to local hospitals .
The admission privilege is a doctor &apos;s right , according to his hospital status , to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates of I@@ V@@ G argue that the content of the law is likely to result in the immediate closure of one third of the state clin@@ ics , because these clin@@ ics have failed to obtain this &quot; admission privilege &quot; for their practi@@ tioners .
In total , it would be almost 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments .
On Monday , a judge of the first instance considered on the eve of the law &apos;s entry into force that the provisions dealing with the admission privilege were un@@ constitutional .
But the At@@ tor@@ ney General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who holds the govern@@ or as govern@@ or , has asked the court of appeal to cancel the judgment of first instance that blocked the application of the law .
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January .
The New Sta@@ r has succeeded in gaining strength , the hearings , with 1.3 million view@@ ers behind their TV stations , or 5.@@ 6 % of the audience .
But was there a spectac@@ le ?
Some 10 000 candidates appeared at the hearings of the 10@@ th season in order to confront the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ a , the S@@ inc@@ l@@ air , the los@@ er An@@ dr@@ é Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
As a result of the exc@@ itement to return to their fav@@ our@@ ite agenda , many were disappointed .
But why do we have so much disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As every year , the first broad@@ casts of the hearing make a broad choice of s@@ ong@@ s in grass , for better and sometimes for the worse .
But , on T@@ wit@@ ter , you want spectac@@ les , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fortunately , some of them have found their way .
Many of them have tried New Sta@@ r , sometimes even to the end .
Beh@@ ind the television scre@@ ens , successful sing@@ ers are still here , season after season .
Others just have the ambition to lau@@ gh .
The Court is blocking a decision on the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D ’ s control and search policy .
A federal appeal court blocked the decision of a judge , on Thursday , demanding changes in the New York Police and Control Programme in New York .
The United States Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) indicated that Jud@@ ge Shi@@ ra Sch@@ e@@ ind@@ in &apos;s decision was suspended until the end of the appeal by the city .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and inter@@ rog@@ ate citizens .
The city has appe@@ aled for its conclusions and corrective orders , including a decision to grant a contro@@ ller to help the police department to change its policy and the associated training programme .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al listened to the arguments on the request for suspension on Tuesday .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al declared that the judge had to be dis@@ car@@ ded because it infring@@ ed the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , partly because of a series of inter@@ views to the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to the Court &apos;s criticism . .
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and His@@ panic men in their control and sear@@ ches programme .
She has appointed an external contro@@ ller to over@@ see the changes , including policy reform , training and supervision , and has ordered a pilot programme to test cam@@ er@@ as on the body in distric@@ ts where the greatest number of checks are carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining names and addresses of people who were rejected after police control .
The hearing of the call by the city should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The control and sear@@ ches tactics have been criticised by many civil rights defenders .
This monitoring and control system has been in some form for decades , but the number of registered controls has risen dramatically under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ berg , to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls , mainly related to black and home@@ -@@ source men . panic .
Ju@@ dic@@ ial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all of them from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Those who advocate changes in the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D ’ s control and search programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices , that they will have more effective police forces that are tru@@ sted , and will be able to change the way police departments use politics .
Op@@ ponents say that these changes would undermine the mor@@ ale of the police without driving down crime , that would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the police were severely reduced over the last decade .
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the control and search practices , which are constitutional , but that they reform the way in which the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its controls .
The ten@@ ants must go , because each of them pays on average $ 100 a month on the price of housing in the V@@ ille .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ ,000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des this amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase rents in order to help us pay the new taxes .
By voting , we are sending out a clear message .
We need to change things in the V@@ ille .
All the candidates have told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay for fire@@ works at $ 100@@ ,000 , from land to $ 4@@ 0-@@ 5 million in case ...
G@@ o to vote , that is the best way of expressing you and saying that it is enough .

The four housing building located in the 15 H@@ ei@@ br@@ ert street has been the subject of three al@@ arms with the fire service .

France Vo@@ is@@ é@@ e , spokes@@ person for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c Fir@@ e Protection Service , made it clear that the rapid intervention of the fire bri@@ g@@ ades prevented the spread of the fl@@ ames to ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where the buildings are built closer .

C@@ ou@@ ping the telephone call to check a tu@@ p
The former ed@@ itor of Ne@@ ws of the World An@@ dy C@@ ou@@ l@@ son would have used “ ha@@ cking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a bi@@ d pi@@ pe on a link involving the then incumbent Minister of the Interior , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
The Chief Prosecutor An@@ drew Ed@@ it Q@@ C told the O@@ ld B@@ ai@@ ley Court that Ne@@ ws of the World had heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ anna@@ h Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , his “ lo@@ vely Special Ad@@ vis@@ er . ”
It was pointed out to the court that the newspaper , G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ c@@ aire , a private detec@@ tor , had to hi@@ j@@ ack the voice box of Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and &apos; constantly plant its own house &apos; , but C@@ ou@@ l@@ son also called it and gave him voice messages .
&apos;@@ The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ ou@@ l@@ son , who is now the ed@@ itor of No@@ t@@ W , is not the kind of man who is to stay in the house of the people in the hope that he may surprise them ; it is the kind of man to love the history of the people to see what they say . That is what we are talking about .
He said that No@@ t@@ W used three means to investigate subjects : piracy , surveillance and confrontation .
The ed@@ itor is personally involved in the third .
It is clear that it is aware of the second , the surveillance , and it cannot be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is he aware of the piracy of telephone calls ?
He says the opposite , but we say &apos; of course &apos; .
The rumours about a C@@ lar@@ W link were first taken up by No@@ t@@ W ’ s office when a source , with a sexual attr@@ action to M@@ iss Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , said that he was told : “ Do not lose your time with her , she is with Charles . ”
One g@@ ang , on which pir@@ ated voice messages on his phone were at least three times , was seized at the home of Mul@@ c@@ ary in August 2006 .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ators also found se@@ iz@@ ures on the private detec@@ tive computer that related to M@@ iss Pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and his s@@ ister s@@ ister in a “ Pro@@ ject ” dossier .
During the period when the detec@@ tive system investigated it , M@@ iss Pa@@ w@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls where they were asked for information about them , added Mr E@@ is .
In the meantime , the former chief executive N@@ ev@@ ille Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former def@@ er James We@@ a@@ ter@@ u@@ p have over@@ seen M@@ iss Pa@@ wi@@ by ’ s most important actions .
In a voice that he gave him on 18 June 2005 , C@@ ou@@ l@@ son said : &apos; I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow , which I would really like to talk about in Charles . &apos;
Mr E@@ d@@ is said that the involvement of C@@ ou@@ l@@ son in history followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former Interior Minister David B@@ l@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury was heard on Thursday that C@@ ou@@ l@@ son had had to deal with Mr B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t on a link with a married woman when he was himself the co-@@ defen@@ se Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ ou@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny that they have con@@ spi@@ red with others to pir@@ ate between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ a@@ ter@@ u@@ p have admitted to ha@@ cking telephone calls .
Barack Obama ’ s Iraqi Prime Minister in the midst of a surge of violence
The US President was due to receive Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , Iraq ’ s prime minister on Friday , 1 November 2013 , seeking assistance from the United States to fight the biggest wave of violence for the past five years .
In October , Iraq experienced the most mur@@ der@@ ous month in five and a half years , according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday 1 November .
9@@ 64 people died in the violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN gives an even higher balance sheet , with 9@@ 79 people dead and 1 9@@ 02 injured .
This violence is becoming more and more mur@@ der@@ ous in spite of strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , dominated by the Sh@@ i ’ a .
The total number of deaths in October has been the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people had been killed .
Appro@@ xim@@ ately two years after the withdrawal of US troops , the level of violence is causing fear of a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation while neighbouring Syria is in a state of civil war .
bombs hit markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ erals .
Men are being shot on the streets or even at home , and the security forces are also being subjected to frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s about being politically marginalised and being the target of unfair arrests , has encouraged this outbreak of violence .
On Friday , new violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars in the north of Baghdad .
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( I@@ I@@ L ) , a group aff@@ ili@@ ated to al-@@ Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , also involved in Syria ’ s civil war .
N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants a “ global war ” against al-@@ Qaeda .
The violence is at the heart of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting , on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the US President , elected on the promise of ending military engagement in that country , pain@@ ted an optimistic picture .
Since he arrived in Washington on Wednesday , N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki has increased meetings with the executive , and cong@@ res@@ sional elected representatives .
On Thursday , he called for the international community to conduct a &apos; third world war &apos; against Al@@ -@@ Qaeda .
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic sen@@ ators .
But the latter also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a Shia , giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his &quot; sec@@ tarian and authoritarian &quot; policy .
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki that “ the per@@ nic@@ ious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . ”
Beijing accuse an U@@ igh@@ ur group of the attack on Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men .
China ’ s internal security leader has accused X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang of a group of U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur separati@@ sts on Friday to be behind the bomb attack that killed five people in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the center of Beijing on Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V , has sh@@ run@@ k over the crow@@ d on the famous place of the Chinese capital , a symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression carried out in 1989 , and made fire killing its three passengers and two p@@ asser@@ s-@@ by .
Mar@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the political office responsible for internal security issues , has accused the Islamic Tur@@ ke@@ stan of being the instig@@ ator of this attack .
Many U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ owned minority in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese province East Tur@@ ke@@ stan .
For the Chinese government , this movement is responsible for frequent erup@@ tions of violence driven by demands for independence .
&apos;@@ The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organised and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &apos; , said M@@ g in the honour of hon@@ or P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x TV .
&apos;@@ The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic Tur@@ ke@@ stan &apos;s Islamic movement &apos; , and he added , as his words were taken up by the new China agency .
The Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of U@@ igh@@ ur origin and made it clear that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained contain@@ ers filled with g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine and a flag with Or@@ thodox religious en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment .
The incident caused 42 people to be injured .
The Islamic Tur@@ ke@@ stan is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations .
The S@@ af@@ e V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on contrac@@ eption , divorce and homosexu@@ ality
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has undertaken to conduct a major poll throughout the world on the way in which the par@@ o@@ ch@@ ial deals with sensitive cases such as contrac@@ eption , divorce and couples of sa@@ me-@@ sex couples .
The survey asks the participants how pri@@ ests look after couples and their children , and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by marriage .
The poll was sent in mid-@@ October at every national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , with the deposit of as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important r@@ ally on the family that Pope Franc@@ is plans to organise next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the &apos; National Catholic Re@@ ad &apos; , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokes@@ person for the United States Catholic B@@ ish@@ ops Conference confirmed that the document was auth@@ enti@@ c and that every b@@ is@@ ho@@ p would decide the appropriate way of s@@ ounding the par@@ is@@ i@@ ers .
In the United Kingdom , b@@ ish@@ ops published the Internet poll by asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .
DR@@ C : The Army attack the final fi@@ ef@@ dom of the rebels
The in@@ tric@@ acies of M@@ 23 , or a few hundred fighters , were entren@@ ched at almost 2@@ ,000 metres of al@@ titude on the agricultural h@@ ills of Chan@@ nel , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i , and M@@ ub@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ om@@ a , with two loc@@ alities located at around 80 km north of the north . G@@ om@@ a , the capital of the province of North Ki@@ v@@ u .
&apos;@@ It has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continues in spite of the night &apos; , it indicated to the A@@ F@@ P an inhabit@@ ant of J@@ om@@ a , ap@@ pen@@ ded to 12.@@ 30 p.m. , and according to which a gir@@ l was shot dead in the morning .
&apos;@@ The intensity of the confron@@ tations has fallen a little &apos; , he added , &apos; it seems that the F@@ ARC For@@ ces of the DR@@ C have delayed the rebels a little &apos; .
According to this witness , it was an@@ onymous , the soldiers had &apos; spent the night &apos; in J@@ om@@ a before moving on to a &apos; ra@@ b@@ b@@ le-@@ co@@ ding operation &apos; .
It was made very clear to him , behind him , that light weapons were being created .
From B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the political and final political fi@@ ef@@ dom of the re@@ bel@@ lion , to Wednesday , a journalist from the A@@ F@@ P could hear heavy arms de@@ ton@@ ations .
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DR@@ C , the fighting entered &apos; in a final phase &apos; , with the F@@ ARC &apos; having &apos; surrounded by the positions of the M@@ 23 to dis@@ lo@@ dge them &apos; .
Since the resumption , on Friday , of the clashes between the Movement of 23 M@@ ars ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , Mon@@ us@@ co has not been directly involved in the fighting , but it has provided government troops with decisive intelligence , observation and planning support .
At the end of the afternoon , several dozen soldiers , who were well supplied with am@@ muni@@ tion , went to the front line .
They were armed with k@@ al@@ ach@@ ni@@ kov and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , a border with Uganda , military personnel ai@@ ded by civilians were loaded with multiple roc@@ ket laun@@ chers on a burning tr@@ uck from the F@@ ARC , to take over from another en@@ sla@@ vement to the positions of the M@@ . 23 on the h@@ ills .
The Congolese President , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , has called on Wednesday evening the rebels once again to &apos; demo@@ bil@@ ise themselves &apos; under pain of being un@@ armed &apos; by force &apos; , but has let the K@@ amp@@ ala process , where Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been discussing since December without a result for the This is a moment .
On the spot , the M@@ 23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement .
&apos;@@ We finished the talks , we only left the Ug@@ and@@ an mediation to organise the signature &apos; , said Ro@@ ger L@@ um@@ ba@@ a , Vice-@@ Chairman of the M@@ 23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
In April 2012 , M@@ 23 was born by a mut@@ ant of former rebels , mostly tu@@ t@@ si , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ali and K@@ amp@@ ala refu@@ te .
North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ soil is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mining resources .
In B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where some 5@@ ,000 people were refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the return movement to the DR@@ C that started in the morning was reversed in the middle of the day .
&apos;@@ This morning we went back to our fields , but the military told us to back us &apos; , said to the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ u@@ i , surrounded by his nine children , including a baby on his backs .
There is the impression that sho@@ ts are coming closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of inhabitants were crossing the border , some with a mat@@ ri@@ x on their heads , to cross the night in Uganda .
The Mu@@ si@@ cal P@@ ass , this P@@ ast Be@@ ast
S@@ l@@ assi@@ fying , sophisticated , popular , English , or d@@ an@@ cing production is taking off .
After Bro@@ ad@@ way and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It is a revolution : French music is being asser@@ ted as a kind of success .
For a long time , from New Lad@@ y de Paris to Mo@@ z@@ art the Oper@@ a O@@ ra ro@@ ck , most attempts would be made ridiculous .
And the successes , such as C@@ ab@@ ar@@ et or the M@@ ist@@ ines , were the h@@ all@@ marks of the myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ lin in the Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ and and the Sen@@ ator - &apos; En@@ ter@@ t@@ é@@ lie in Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or &apos; has changed the situation .
Today , these two scenes are making headlines as successful tu@@ bes .
The first is that , this Christmas , his excellent M@@ y F@@ air Lad@@ y and announced the global creation of &apos; an American in Paris &apos; .
In Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or , &quot; B@@ é@@ le and the B@@ ast &quot; may well be one of the successes of the season .
On the other scenes , mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les such as &apos; 17@@ 89 &apos; , &apos; the lo@@ vers of the Bas@@ til@@ le &apos; and the small mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans such as &apos; Dis@@ co &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are showing success and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , author of the “ history of mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ound ” reference book and conf@@ er on the Ch@@ at@@ t@@ el@@ es The@@ at@@ li@@ an , analyses the reasons for the success that has been so badly won .
How is the French mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy ?
The supply has increased .
First of all , there are the &apos; mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les &apos; that evolve as a result of the producers ...
Some use - beautiful projec@@ tions of images and a - as in 17@@ 89 , the A@@ man@@ ts of the Bas@@ til@@ le .
Others are j@@ um@@ ping back from 15 years on the pretext that one can be used as a post@@ er in the post@@ er .
After all , we have the mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy with the so-called &apos; s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ous produc@@ tions of the Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ and &apos; which are bringing us back to the golden age of Bro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay and are finding out the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ he@@ im , the largest living com@@ pos@@ er .
S@@ ligh@@ tly popul@@ ating the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon mu@@ si@@ cal edi@@ tions of variety by adapting them to French .
Independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough .
But ongoing projects like &apos; R@@ oun@@ ce &apos; , &apos; The B@@ ai@@ er of En@@ ai@@ ded Women &apos; or the &apos; E@@ Spring Spring &apos; have difficulty in being financed .
Do we have enough artists capable of being sing@@ led out as sing@@ er , playing and d@@ an@@ cing ?
In Paris , when there are eight music spectac@@ les in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 tal@@ ents who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , the cra@@ dle of the mu@@ si@@ cal edi@@ fic@@ e , it is very different .
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools .
There are many jobs between regional theat@@ res , which have been tor@@ mented , Bro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay , off-@@ -B@@ ro@@ ad@@ w@@ ay ...
The breeding of talent is as high as the number of jobs to be filled .
Why are the tor@@ tu@@ rers in the province so successful ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor relation of culture in France .
Fe@@ w theat@@ res of theat@@ re leave on tour , and it is often the theat@@ re of a s@@ ou@@ le@@ ard for adults and not for young adults .
There is a lack of mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les .
It is these same young people who love reality and what it produces as ep@@ hem@@ eral st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful ( often tal@@ ented ) young men at the forefront of a mu@@ si@@ cal show is the assurance that these young girls and often their entire family will be eng@@ ul@@ fed .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these spectac@@ les are app@@ alled by professionals who answer questions .
These spectac@@ les are very expected when they arrive in a province of province .
The tide is rising in Paris and d@@ ressed up by prov@@ in@@ cial prov@@ in@@ cial forces .

A road accident caused a serious w@@ ounded , Friday morning at 5@@ 30 , on the internal ring of Brussels to Ho@@ il@@ a@@ art , to W@@ ater@@ lo@@ o .
A driver &apos;s car was h@@ oused by a ph@@ an@@ tom driver who is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
The ring was closed to the circulation , up to 9.@@ 00 , at the time of the accident , the time that the road was cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
This situation has not , however , caused any traffic congestion , because the accident took place at the he@@ ight of the H@@ o@@ il@@ a@@ art exit .
As a result , traffic has been diver@@ ted from the exit / entry .

DR@@ C : The Army is preparing a new assault
Children are playing on carbon le@@ ak@@ y belonging to the M@@ 23 rebels in K@@ i@@ bu@@ m@@ ba , on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The Congolese army was preparing for a new attack on the latest bas@@ tions of the M@@ 23 rebels of the M@@ 23 near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The aim is to dis@@ lo@@ dge M@@ 23 of the h@@ ills which sur@@ round B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Yesterday we took the Bu@@ in@@ a h@@ ill , which over@@ sho@@ ots that of M@@ ub@@ z@@ i .
Today , M@@ ub@@ z@@ i should fall from herself .
There will be no more than the R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i h@@ ill .
&apos;@@ It is not very strategic &apos; , it has indicated that the A@@ F@@ P has the Govern@@ or of North Ki@@ v@@ u , Ju@@ li@@ an P@@ lu@@ k@@ u .
Mr P@@ lu@@ k@@ u plans to go to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana on Saturday .
This loc@@ ality is located on the Ug@@ and@@ an border at around 80 km north of G@@ om@@ a .
It was taken on Wednesday by the Ar@@ med For@@ ces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday .
Since then , a few hundred of the M@@ 23 ’ s are cut off to almost 2 000 metres of al@@ titude on the agricultural h@@ ills of Chancellor , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ ub@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and the ne@@ ar@@ by loc@@ ality of J@@ om@@ a
In J@@ om@@ a , an inhabit@@ ant of close fi@@ ghts on Thursday , for all day , indicated that the situation was “ quiet since this morning . ”
According to him , a woman and his child were killed by the fighting on the eve and were buried .
A gir@@ l was shot dead , and three other people were injured , with a gri@@ ev@@ ance , evac@@ uated by the F@@ AR@@ DC , added that bat@@ on by the A@@ F@@ P .
Since the resumption of fighting between F@@ AR@@ DC and rebel on 25 October , the two bel@@ li@@ ge@@ rents have not given any account of the loss of human life .
The N@@ SA ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations increase companies ’ par@@ ano@@ ia about state surveillance .
In a beautiful day at the end of August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter so@@ ared at low levels of the British Con@@ su@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , the financial capital of Germany .
At the beh@@ est of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the German national intelligence agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the US out@@ post , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explain that B@@ af@@ V had hoped to identify the presence of listening an@@ ten@@ na@@ e and that the operation gave rise to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
Never again in September , the director of the American intelligence services , insisted that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to “ ste@@ al foreign companies ’ industrial secre@@ ts for American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ”
But , since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the consul@@ tant , has begun to un@@ cover his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble wealth of information about US surveillance secre@@ ts , European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director .
Re@@ ports , according to which the US National Security Agency sp@@ y on Brazil ’ s oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in C@@ lou@@ d , including Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , has been more than ever ar@@ oused by par@@ ano@@ id par@@ ag@@ ons . We have to do something about state surveillance .
The re@@ vel@@ ation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been ha@@ c@@ ked , perhaps for a decade , was the drop of water that broke the ca@@ me@@ l &apos;s back .
If Europe ’ s most powerful person can be targeted , then business leaders are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den has made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence and companies transparent .
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used in their mutual interest .
&apos;@@ Germany must wake up &apos; , declare O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ ü@@ n , President of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , who represents the German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the US is a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data flight , according to an investigation published by the E@@ Y cabinet in July .
However , in all the documents un@@ ve@@ iled by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Business leaders are skep@@ tical about this .
One Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only close our eyes and re-@@ open them slowly ...
“ This is not the right way to go , ” says H@@ as@@ o Pl@@ att@@ ner , the president of the German company software company , SA@@ P .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then it should not be allowed to die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , from coal to cars , to farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophistic@@ ation of US es@@ pion@@ age agencies exposed by S@@ now@@ den ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations was a shock to some companies that thought until now that China represented the biggest risk in terms of surveillance .
A major change is taking place in cl@@ oud computer , as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable .
According to a survey carried out by the C@@ lou@@ d Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-@@ US members abandoned their plans to use an American supplier of st@@ all storage services after the re@@ vel@@ ations about the US P@@ ris@@ m data expl@@ oration program .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &apos; Our customers are asking us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago : where my data is stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that court ? &apos;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most valuable secre@@ ts and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is not surprising that there is economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There have always been .
&apos;@@ It has been a recur@@ ring theme for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the context of the current discussion &apos; , dec@@ la@@ res Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck , Director-General of the B@@ AS@@ F chemicals company .
The Americans are sp@@ ying on business and industry just as we are sp@@ ying on them , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
En@@ treprene@@ urs are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures that they have put in place , in the event that this would leave an ad@@ versary to the advantage of an op@@ ponent .
Lar@@ ge companies have long held the message that it is un@@ wise , at least , to rec@@ ou@@ p a free U@@ S@@ B in a professional show@@ room or to leave a lap@@ top computer in a ho@@ tel room .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ack@@ enberg , a member of the board of the Au@@ to-@@ car manufacturer , says that the collection of mobile phones prior to board meetings , so that they cannot be used as remote e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping devices , has been common practice for years .
Germany ’ s B@@ F@@ V advis@@ es its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones paid for their journeys abroad because of the risk of undermining the integrity of smar@@ t@@ phones .
Mob@@ ile phones that are paid for are then thrown out .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&apos;@@ SMEs often lack experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access &apos; , warning B@@ f@@ V in a report .
The United States al@@ er@@ ts their own companies to the activities of economic es@@ pion@@ age by other countries .
The United States National Int@@ elli@@ gence E@@ sti@@ m@@ ate ( N@@ I@@ E ) was quoted in February by the United States , as was Russia and Israel , which were guilty of ha@@ cking on economic intelligence , behind China , according to the Washington Po@@ st .
A member of the board of a re@@ now@@ ned German company thought that , when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , the French are the worst .
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ Quartet , the former French Internal Int@@ elli@@ gence Director , the D@@ C@@ R@@ I , said in an interview this month : “ Services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , are sp@@ ying on their allies . ”
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er of Georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , believe that their son was murdered .
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er of Georgia , whose body was found in a ru@@ d@@ der@@ less car@@ pet in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ sia of his high school , think that their son was murdered , declared a family lawyer on Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , from Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on January 11 , stuck in a strong car@@ pet behind the gra@@ ins of the gy@@ m@@ na@@ sia of his high school .
The investig@@ ators of L@@ ow@@ n@@ u ’ s S@@ her@@ i@@ ff concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son had died in unusual circumstances , but the 1@@ 7-@@ year-old family ’ s family is con@@ testing these conclusions .
“ They are absolutely sure that their son has been murdered , ” said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ m@@ p , the lawyer , Mr Ken@@ ne@@ th and Mr Joh@@ n@@ son , on Fe@@ x@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
They never thought that he was dead , as is stated in the conclusions of the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff .
“ They think it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physi@@ cs , and common sense , ” C@@ ru@@ mon@@ p added .
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered solely for the purpose of covering the people responsible for the death of their son .
“ They sent their son to school with a car@@ table , and they were given them in a mor@@ tal s@@ ack , ” he added .
The US Public Prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , pointing out that a number of important issues remained un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
Mo@@ ore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I shall follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My aim is to find out the truth .
“ I think there is a sufficient basis for an official investigation , ” he said .
Mo@@ ore told journalists that the first post-@@ mor@@ te@@ m indicated that Joh@@ n@@ son was killed by “ posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . ”
However , a second post-@@ mor@@ te@@ m has identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&apos;@@ A number of questions still deserve a response or confirmation &apos; , he indicated .
Mo@@ ore added that if he un@@ covered elements of a civil or criminal investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , he would ask the F@@ B@@ I to carry it out .
The representative of the S@@ her@@ i@@ ff Coun@@ ty Office was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him on Thursday .
A southern Georgian judge ordered the authorities to hand all the vide@@ o@@ surveillance records that the investig@@ ators had examined on Wednesday .
The parents of the teen@@ ag@@ er said that they hoped that video images would contain evidence of the circumstances of his death .
The C@@ DC publ@@ ishes advice on aller@@ gies in children for schools .
On Wednesday , the US Centre for Dis@@ ease Prevention and Prevention published a series of directives on how to deal with children &apos;s food aller@@ gies in school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US government publ@@ ishes , as the number of school@@ -@@ age children suffering from food aller@@ gies has risen sharply .
One in 20 children in the United States is now suffering from a food all@@ ergy .
The C@@ DA found that the pre@@ valence of food aller@@ gies in the child increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among the prof@@ essor and the staff of food aller@@ gies in the child , and how to deal with them in the event of an aller@@ gic reaction .
It also recommends that schools should have an inven@@ tory – the E@@ pi@@ P@@ en brand as the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially leth@@ al an@@ a@@ them@@ a .
The Member States &apos; legislative assemb@@ lies recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have an stock in stock .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
Children can say , ‘ I have the impression that something is the language of my language ’ , ‘ I have the impression that I have a horse on the language ’ or ‘ I have p@@ co@@ ts on the language ’ .
The N@@ SA case highlights the absence of a total intelligence debate .
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which on one side is off@@ ended in public by conven@@ ing the United States Ambassador on 21 October , and on the other banning over@@ flying of the territory by the Boli@@ vian presidential aircraft , on the basis of the rum@@ our of the presence on board at Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de calls Barack Obama or Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent Fab@@ i@@ us the US ambassador , they respond to a real discovery , which is the scale of US supervision over all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the col@@ um@@ ns of Mon@@ de just a few weeks apart from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspon@@ dence and a condemnation of the words of the N@@ ai d &apos;@@ Or@@ say by the N@@ SA ?
Would it not be like a hypocrisy on your part ?
The journ@@ alistic approach is not a moral posi@@ tioning , but a search for the interest and relevance of information that makes it possible for every citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks lift the ve@@ il over the analysis by US diplomacy of political or other issues around the world , we believe that , in view of American power , this is an important lighting .
When we describe the American inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is by no means the case that we are indign@@ ant about this practice , it is to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the N@@ SA on terrorist operations against our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The way in which the United States , but also France , has been able to put in place a decade of technology for inter@@ cep@@ ting very powerful inter@@ c@@ eption technology has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Indeed , in this area , France and the United States , in particular , have established procedures for cooperation and exchanges of information almost daily , and which are described on both sides as essential .
By way of example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal areas in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sh@@ ah was reported to the French thanks to the resources of the N@@ SA .
France can be led , for example , to pass on entire blocks of data on the Sa@@ hel region to US services , and in return , as has already been said , Americans can give the French information about other parts of the world .
The fundamental issue behind this N@@ SA case , therefore , is not so much the ability or the right of the countries to equip themselves with inter@@ c@@ eption tools , the question of the total absence of prior debate , particularly in the Parlia@@ ments , the justification of such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be their own , and , at the end of the day , , the issue of attacks on freedoms .
What is the real risk to the US , a deterioration of its image ?
Although they are denounced , I do not see how they can be punished .
America ’ s risk can be two@@ fold .
The first is when their allies – and this was the case recently – learn that their leaders , sometimes at the top of their state , have been monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have stra@@ ined .
Another effect may be more econom@@ ical : more and more European or South American companies are reluctant , in the light of re@@ vel@@ ations , to entr@@ ust their confidential data to American suppliers who are subject to American law , and thus to the grip of the N@@ SA .
My final point is that the vast movement of media re@@ vel@@ ations from all over the world , which helps to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of intelligence services hitherto almost non-existent , could push legislators , including US legislators , to reconsider the powers that they have given to their intelligence services .
Pa@@ rents of inter@@ sexual children can choose ‘ un@@ defined sex ’ .
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for inf@@ ants born with ambiguous sexual organs .
The male or female sex of the new born will no longer be assigned to birth in a rigid manner .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children , allowing them to enter an &apos; indefin@@ ite &apos; sex or &apos; un@@ specified &apos; sex on their birth certificate .
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could take ha@@ sty decisions on the sur@@ ger@@ y of sexual as@@ sign@@ ment for their inf@@ ant , and to combat discrimination against people who are inter@@ sex@@ ually discriminated against .
According to the B@@ BC , an inter@@ sex@@ y person would have said years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work of doctors , con@@ ni@@ v@@ ance and wh@@ ist@@ le .
It is estimated that a child of 2 000 born each year is neither a bo@@ y nor a gir@@ l .
They are inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized , inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality , which is part of the six@@ ty diseases diagno@@ sed as disorder in sexual development , a generic term that design@@ ates at@@ yp@@ ical ch@@ ro@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es or at@@ yp@@ ical ( o@@ sten@@ sibly ) at@@ yp@@ ical or un@@ developed sexual organs . .

S@@ ex@@ ual identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined , it is better to use the best information available to at@@ tribute it , then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a sur@@ gical act , if necessary .
Dr J@@ ack D@@ res@@ cher , a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and an expert on sexual identification , said that the new German law &apos; seems to be a good idea &apos; .
Inter@@ sex@@ y children pose an ethical dilemma .
“ Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require sur@@ gical action , but most children do not , ” he added .
It is possible to make sexual as@@ sign@@ ment without operation , and to see how identity develops .
The science of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise .
Nobody can answer the question as to why this is happening .
It is like the myster@@ y surrounding homosexuals .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described people who are inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alised as different from trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender people , since their status is not linked to gender , but rather to their biological constitution , which is neither that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman , but is generally the two at the same time . and not clearly defined as one or the other .
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as mus@@ c@@ le mass , p@@ ilo@@ ting , ch@@ err@@ y-@@ picking , and stat@@ ure , primary sexual characteristics ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) , or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es and hormones .
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people in employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
Young non-@@ compli@@ ant boys now have camps specially intended for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male , female or ‘ third sex ’ on their official documents .
In June , an Austr@@ ali@@ an 5@@ 7-@@ year-old Austr@@ ali@@ an , Nor@@ ri@@ e May@@ -@@ Wel@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been “ neutral ” after winning his appeal trial , allowing him to keep a “ un@@ specified ” sex for life .
German passports will include a third or F designation , or F – for inter@@ sex@@ y , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still the subject of controversy , according to a report broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of law@@ -@@ makers in this deeply Catholic country signed a petition for “ gender theory ” to be removed from school books .
The American state of Ca@@ the@@ c On@@ line also opposed German law , writing that “ since the world is dra@@ gged into a new rule in which gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one , you are rever@@ sing two other pillars of civili@@ zation . ”
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of an inf@@ ant also declared B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth .
“ The role of parent is st@@ agg@@ ering enough without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , ” she said on the site for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sexual organs were called her@@ m@@ ph@@ ro@@ d@@ ite , according to the name of the wonderful Greek go@@ d who had a dual sex .
And , just about ten years ago , the medical community regarded gender as a gar@@ den , which can be wi@@ ped out and which can be re@@ drawn .
But now many people are calling into question the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong , not knowing how a child will feel his sexual re@@ as@@ sign@@ ation when he grows up .
In the middle of the 20th century , this was called a psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency . &apos;
When these children were born , you did not call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , you were ph@@ oning the sur@@ ge@@ on .
The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Mon@@ ey , the Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins University , who considered gender m@@ alle@@ able .
He devoted the term “ sexual identity ” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way in which parents raise a child – inter@@ act with a child ’ s genes and hormones to shape it to be identified as a female or female male .
But , in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as “ John Jo@@ an , ” his the@@ ories gave rise to controversy .
He advised the parents of a bo@@ y whose pen@@ s had been cut off during a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to have him fully ca@@ str@@ ated , also taking away the tes@@ ticul@@ ar and raising him as a gir@@ l .
“ Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transition , but it was not the case , ” he said .
At the age of 15 , he has once again become a bo@@ y and married with a woman .
But , at 38 years , he committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ re@@ er said that some doctors are “ repeating this model . ”
But in the 1990 &apos;s , with the arrival of the Internet , those who survived these sex changes say &apos; they are not satisfied with the result &apos; .
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-old writ@@ er of Mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es X@@ Y but ambiguous sexual bodies .
Do@@ c@@ tors could not really say whether he had a broad c@@ lic@@ h@@ é or a small pen@@ se , and were convinced that he could never have a “ good life ” as a man .
So little time after his birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered a sur@@ gical ab@@ rog@@ ation of the external body and tes@@ ticul@@ ar and was raised like a gir@@ l .
They were taken to account for female hormones at the age of 12 .
“ I knew that I was not a gir@@ l , ” he said about A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At the age of 18 , he has been v@@ ag@@ op@@ l@@ ated .
But de@@ pressed and realising that something was wrong , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horri@@ fied .
I was ster@@ il@@ ised at birth – and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a dis@@ array of sexual development ( D@@ D@@ S ) , which prevented her body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one for sexual organs to develop .
Having learned the truth , he has once again become a man , following a treatment in te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one and taking away the se@@ ins .
sur@@ ger@@ y has made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he is defending the cause of others in an organization called the Pro@@ ject Inter@@ face , which is trying to norm@@ alize the perception of sex@@ ually motivated people .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ tim@@ s , direc@@ tor@@ -@@ general of the non-@@ profit organization based in California for In@@ formal C@@ ho@@ ice , fears that the German law “ inv@@ ites labelling and stig@@ ma . ”
“ Many activists worry that German law will encourage parents to take quick decisions and give their child an “ indefin@@ ite ” sex , ” she said .
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions .
We believe that it would be better to give a male or female sex and wait .
But we have not seen what the law is going to be , so we can only put forward assumptions .
Tam@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ tim@@ s said that his organisation supported Austr@@ ali@@ an law , because &apos; it allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex &apos; .
“ Ad@@ ults should be able to make their own decisions on legal matters , ” she added .
The German law relates to the allocation of sex at birth .
This is not a battle that young children should be fighting to this age .
When they grow up , they will be able to take decisions on their own bodies .
But Dr Ar@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , who is specialist radi@@ olog@@ ist in Pit@@ t@@ s@@ burgh ma@@ m@@ mo@@ graphy , whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group , has said that the German law &apos; will &apos; &apos; make parents &apos; and the Children .
D@@ r@@ . Bar@@ at@@ z ’ s daughter , K@@ aw@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ o@@ s@@ om@@ es , but suffers from a D@@ D@@ S called in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me with an@@ od@@ ro@@ do@@ s .
As a result of the failure of an@@ od@@ ro@@ gen recei@@ vers , K@@ aw@@ s has developed female characteristics .
She has a v@@ ag@@ in , but she does not have u@@ ter@@ us or o@@ vens .
Today , 29 years , K@@ aw@@ a is married and internal in inf@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at the University of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
Although it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or sur@@ rog@@ ate mothers .
&apos;@@ The law leaves a certain la@@ titude to parents so that they do not have to take ha@@ sty decisions &apos; , said Bar@@ at@@ z .
This gives them time to carry out certain tests and understand them , and a deadline before putting &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female &apos; .
So everything goes well – you can raise your child and love it .
You have a wonderful baby and take advantage of the pleasure of being parent .
You do not need to rush for a sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
‘ This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they are afraid of not doing what they need ’ , has said .
Finally , the child will decide with which sex he / she feels the most comfortable – and that is a great thing .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .
Le@@ t@@ ta in the long@@ ev@@ ity of his government
The President of the Italian Council , En@@ ric@@ o Le@@ t@@ ta , considers that his government will be held until 2015 , despite the strong tensions between left and right in the ruling coalition in the run-up to the vote of the Senate in the run-up to Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi of his term of office .
In a daily interview with La Sta@@ mp@@ a , the cen@@ ter-@@ left leader said that he had “ firmly committed to continuing to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015 .
The Italian Parliament &apos;s upper house will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council who was convicted of tax fraud in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate , where he has more ad@@ vers@@ aries than supporters , dis@@ charges his dismis@@ sal .
But part of his camp , grou@@ ped around the National Secretary of the People ’ s Freedom ( P@@ D@@ L ) , Ang@@ el@@ ino Al@@ f@@ ano , continues to support the government , as demonstrated by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi ’ s in@@ junc@@ tions who already wanted to bring the cabinet down .
L@@ .@@ A@@ . Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Safety Agency , T@@ SA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gun@@ s .
The fi@@ re-@@ fighters who were called on the scene claimed to have responded to an appeal of &apos; many w@@ ounded &apos; .
&apos;@@ The forces of law and order are on the spot &apos; , says the airport on its T@@ wit@@ ter account , when pictures of tele@@ visions showed people evac@@ uated in am@@ bul@@ ances .
&apos;@@ There was a sho@@ oting &apos; , said to the A@@ F@@ P a spokes@@ person for the US Transport Safety Agency ( T@@ SA ) .
The local A@@ BC an@@ ten@@ na showed a person evac@@ uated on a pe@@ g , and a second transported on a whe@@ el@@ chair .
The incident took place at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( 12.@@ 30 in Mon@@ tre@@ al ) at ter@@ minal 3 of the airport , also specified the airport .
The L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Times says that t@@ em@@ in@@ als 2 and 3 are being evac@@ uated .
The T@@ SA spokesman was not in a position to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured .
All flights to and from the airport were suspended .
The Israeli Army k@@ ic@@ king a member of Hamas to Gaz@@ a-@@ S@@ es
The fir@@ ing of Israeli tanks killed an Islamist Palestinian milit@@ ant on Thursday and has seriously w@@ ounded another in the south of the Gaza Strip , and has been taught after sources of health services .
A source from Hamas has explained that fighting has broken out in this region , because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mor@@ als .
The Israeli army has only referred to a &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a &apos; terrorist &apos; tunnel by the Jewish state , dig@@ ging at the border , the discovery of which was announced in the middle of October .
Report : The Obama Cam@@ pai@@ gn B@@ id@@ en for H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advis@@ ors envisaged , in the greatest secrecy , the replacement of Vice-President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en by H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most striking event in the eag@@ er@@ ness of the 2012 Mar@@ k H@@ al@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ mann campaign , “ D@@ own D@@ own : G@@ ame Change 2012 . ”
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday evening that the president ’ s close collabor@@ ators had conducted “ hard work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see whether B@@ id@@ en ’ s ou@@ ster could help Obama in his re-@@ election while his hopes were d@@ wind@@ ling .
According to the political correspon@@ dent J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin , the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials in the campaign and of the White House , namely former Secretary General of the White House Bill Dan@@ e@@ y , to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-@@ president by former Clinton Secretary of State will have . The vote could be on the ballot .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fier@@ cely guar@@ ded in the Chic@@ ago Cam@@ pai@@ gn in Chic@@ ago and inside the o@@ val Bureau .
Only half a dozen members of the president ’ s senior advis@@ ors – including , for example , Obama , Obama ’ s former head of campaign J@@ im M@@ es@@ ina and former advis@@ ors in the White House , David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and David P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e – knew that change was under consideration .
“ D@@ ow@@ n ” indicates that Dan@@ e@@ y led B@@ id@@ en , despite their “ close personal links , ” before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that Clinton was on the “ presidential list ” “ not significantly improving Obama ’ s chances of success . ”
In an interview with Martin , Dan@@ e@@ y confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
‘ I said that I had examined a whole range of issues , and that was one of them ’ , said Dan@@ e@@ y to the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that , at that time , the President was not in shape , and so we were told , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos;
As Dam@@ y called the “ concerted ” examination , Martin indicated to Ander@@ son Co@@ op@@ er of C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested a lot of money to find out whether the change would be beneficial in the election .
&apos;@@ Cam@@ pai@@ gn@@ s do not spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action &apos; , said Martin on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
However , it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was looking at replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N whom he had asked for in Dan@@ e@@ y if his bos@@ s was aware of the possible res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le .
Although Dan@@ e@@ y said that he did not think that the president “ knew ” about the possible change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was “ possible ” that Obama knew .
Martin added that &apos; D@@ ow@@ n D@@ own &apos; did not definitively answer the question of whether political opinion polls had reached the Obama office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama did not know that B@@ id@@ en ’ s ou@@ ster of the presidential list was under consideration .
‘ Perhaps ’ , Mr Martin replied .
Do you want a flu@@ o ice ?
A British entreprene@@ ur has created the first flu@@ id flu@@ or@@ c@@ le in the world of mis@@ carri@@ ages .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has taken advantage of flu@@ or@@ res@@ cent properties of this marine animal to develop a light col@@ lis@@ ion .
He had the idea after reading a study on the me@@ tr@@ ics and convinced Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate the brilliant protein .
The cre@@ am cre@@ am re@@ acts with the language by increasing the protein p@@ H to sh@@ ine .
According to Ch@@ ris , since the ice cre@@ am starts to read when she re@@ acts to the m@@ ou@@ ths of the mouth , the more it becomes , the more brilliant she is .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the “ L@@ ick M@@ e I@@ m De@@ li@@ ci@@ us , ” said : “ It is incredible , but we are still at the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of this tru@@ ce costs about £ 200 . ”
The protein we use in the ice re@@ acts with the language of neutral language .
So when your mouth warm the protein , p@@ H levels are rising , and the ice is b@@ lowing .
We have tested it in the last few months , and it seemed appropriate to share it with all of us at the time of H@@ all@@ é@@ en , because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
It is probably the most expensive ice that I have created , because the light of the me@@ du@@ s is worth four times as much as gold .
So every but@@ ton costs me about £ 140 .
But it is rather good !
Society for the experimental approach of Char@@ lie , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual gl@@ asses such as beer , che@@ ese , beef and the gold map .
But its next creation will be even more ambitious .
He added : “ I would really like to develop an in@@ visible ice . ”
This is intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the spread of ice cryst@@ als , which are the ice cre@@ am , but I think I will find a way to do that .
I@@ ce uses flu@@ or@@ res@@ cent properties of the mis@@ de@@ mean@@ our syn@@ the@@ tically summar@@ ized by Chinese scientists .
L@@ ou Re@@ ed died during a cu@@ t-@@ off session
The sing@@ er L@@ ou Re@@ ed died at a time when he made t@@ at@@ i exercises , revealed his wife L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son in a letter published by the regional newspaper , East Ham@@ p@@ ton Sta@@ r , for the inhabitants of the city of Sav@@ ings , where the couple had a house .
The arti@@ st died last Sunday , at the age of 71 .
&apos;@@ He died on Sunday morning , when he looked at the trees and carried out the famous 21st chi movement , with his hands as a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an who was taking the air &apos; , writ@@ es L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son .
L@@ ou Re@@ ed was master of life , a Chinese mar@@ tial .
The sing@@ er ’ s wife also explained that she promised her hus@@ band , the week before his death , to get him out of the hospital and take him to their house in Sav@@ ings ( L@@ ong Is@@ land ) .
L@@ ou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years .
And even if we are city d@@ wel@@ lers , it is our spiritual home .
&apos;@@ L@@ ou was a pr@@ ince and a figh@@ ter , and I know that his s@@ ong@@ s on the pain and beau@@ ty of the world will convey to many people the great joy of life he had &apos; .
As a result of this last May , the li@@ ver was gra@@ f@@ ted to the li@@ ver .
H@@ hal@@ we@@ n 2013 : In figures
When I was a small , H@@ all@@ we@@ en was magic .
My s@@ ister and I were allowed to eat swee@@ ts , go late and d@@ ress up in order to go to the neighbourhood .
Today , I have become more p@@ ing@@ y .
Over the last two years , I have not distributed a single bon@@ us , and I will certainly not do so this year .
But the tra@@ pp@@ ings show that I am a black sheep when we talk about H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ en .
Most Americans – 15@@ 8 million of them in fact – will celebrate H@@ hal@@ we@@ en this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 M@@ d of swee@@ ts , disgu@@ ise , and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to the National Re@@ al Federation .
What I am looking forward to at every party in H@@ all@@ we@@ en are the trends .
R@@ is@@ ks should represent $ 1.2 M@@ ade of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , un@@ anim@@ ated sex@@ ually in@@ anim@@ ate objects are being made .
Women no longer need to be sex@@ y professionals ; they can also be sex@@ y foods as p@@ iz@@ z@@ as , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As far as men are concerned , I expect to see many z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , thanks to the television series The Wal@@ king De@@ ad , and I am be@@ tting that the men in the area of D@@ of@@ t P@@ un@@ k will be among our photo@@ graph@@ s this year .
According to Google , the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after disgu@@ ises are the z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my aston@@ ishment , they were not the only ones .
In fact , the Americans are going to spend $ 3@@ 30 on the ta@@ b for animals this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
It has made a lot of curious dogs into h@@ ot@@ dog@@ s .
When it comes to swee@@ ts , you do not get bo@@ gged down .
The Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 M@@ d in swee@@ ts this year , according to the Ni@@ el@@ sen cabinet .
This is about 27@@ 2 million k@@ g of Her@@ sh@@ ey , sugar , sugar , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ l@@ ers and Bar@@ res C@@ lar@@ k .
It is a new sup@@ er for the 41 million children who are going to hun@@ t for swee@@ ts in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Comm@@ er@@ ce .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not tell us , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate in H@@ hal@@ we@@ en .
Good maize is the only thing you do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million k@@ g are sold for He@@ al@@ we@@ en , according to the National Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t Association .
This amounts to around 9 billion grain gra@@ ins .
It is a myster@@ y that I have not yet managed to clarify .
Nothing is more representative of He@@ al@@ we@@ en than H@@ un@@ ted houses .
They wear the best names , such as “ Ter@@ r@@ ar Be@@ h@@ in@@ d the Wall@@ s ” ( who is in fact a real prison ) , “ H@@ l-@@ O@@ -@@ S@@ c@@ re@@ am ” and “ The House of Sh@@ oc@@ k . ”
In fact , there are 1 200 ha@@ un@@ ted houses that have been officially recognised in the United States , which generate approximately $ 500 of revenue , according to America Ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes these form@@ idable photo@@ graph@@ s of you , which you are putting on Fac@@ e@@ book and which you cannot take away from you . And , on which you like a kind of &apos; nice head &apos; of a kind that you like well , there is a comment to be made .
Finally , let us talk about cement .
Char@@ lie Brown presented us with the ro@@ tten C@@ ro@@ is@@ se , when you were in a gam@@ ble , and s@@ cul@@ p@@ sed a gr@@ in@@ ding cement in the form of a Christmas tre@@ e – that is something that has been done since you are small .
Fortunately , for us , the “ attitude of the ben@@ i@@ gn ” began only last year with P@@ inter@@ rest , so most of us s@@ cul@@ led these po@@ ts and did not have to sit down .
This year , Americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 in cement , according to the U@@ .@@ S@@ . C@@ en@@ sus Bureau .
The for@@ ger@@ ies that are slowly f@@ lowing into the por@@ k of your house probably came from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 5@@ 42 million cement tanks were cultiv@@ ated this year .
If you look more closely at you , call it Ti@@ m Ti@@ m and S@@ us@@ an M@@ ath@@ is@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , in California , and try to s@@ cul@@ p@@ ate their cement from 9@@ 22 k@@ g .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland will create internally a “ bad bank ” structure ( “ bad bank ” ) of € 38 billion ( € 45 billion ) of the most ris@@ k@@ ier assets , a measure designed to rela@@ x its relations with London and accelerate its re@@ privatization .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheets from 55 % to 70 % over the next two years and hopes to clean@@ se it completely within three years .
R@@ B@@ S also said that it would include a provision for depreci@@ ation of the additional $ 4 to 4@@ .5 billion p@@ ounds on the quarter , a writ@@ er linked to the establishment of the Bo@@ x structure .
R@@ B@@ S also made it clear that this internal restructuring would free up a capital books of 10 to 11 billion , thereby strengthening its capacity to lend .
The bank and London have pointed out that “ bad bank ” would draw a line under the past , with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of R@@ B@@ S .
&apos;@@ We can now move forward , concern ourselves with the future and the 90 % of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large customer bank and the United Kingdom &apos; , said the new Director-General Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan to the press .
L@@ and R@@ over announ@@ ces his spons@@ oring of a series of ra@@ ys
The inter@@ ior has a six-@@ point seat and seat bel@@ t , as well as an Inter@@ co@@ m system .
One of the options , in particular , is improved bra@@ kes , a service giving access to mechan@@ ics in the case of Bow@@ ler Wor@@ ks , logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events .
D@@ re@@ w Bow@@ ler , the managing director of Bow@@ ler M@@ ot@@ or@@ port said : “ The d@@ ul@@ ls who join Bow@@ ler have changed . ”
Not all of them have experienced , some seek exc@@ itement and ad@@ venture and realistic access to international events .
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with L@@ and R@@ over and the M@@ SA , and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to make a variety of forms in the United Kingdom and internationally , and to prepare for the ri@@ g@@ ors and the realities of ra@@ ids . .
We had a great deal of pleasure in developing the D@@ ef@@ der Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge – the cham@@ pion@@ ship will really be pal@@ p@@ able . ”
Furthermore , D@@ ef@@ der Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge will propose a training day and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deser@@ ts of North Africa and the Middle East .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade was called to rescue a lost pu@@ pp@@ y after he remained stuck to 15 metres above the soil on an unstable cor@@ n@@ uc@@ he in a career .
Ru@@ by , an in@@ trac@@ table co@@ ker , escap@@ ed after an accident of the un@@ gravity of the road .
It was found three days later by a person who wal@@ ked his dog in the career .
The fi@@ re-@@ fighters des@@ cen@@ ded on the c@@ lif@@ f to recover the Chil@@ ean and save it from a certain death .
A chi@@ ot had the chance to escape the worst after the fire bri@@ g@@ ades were asked to recover it safely while it was lost to 15 metres above the ground on the unstable seas@@ ons of a c@@ lif@@ f .
Ru@@ by , a 9 months co@@ ok , escap@@ ed after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being res@@ cu@@ ed in a career on Wednesday .
Its owners , Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years , and his small Bec@@ ke@@ y H@@ all friend , 20 years old , went to the career of F@@ app@@ p@@ res@@ e in D@@ en@@ ro@@ me , the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to return to Ru@@ by and than@@ ked the fire and rescue service . In West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
They had sought desperately to lose their chi@@ ps and launched a call on the sites of social networks after it disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity .
T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ .@@ 15 on Wednesday , someone with a sharp eye who wal@@ ked his dog had re@@ pen@@ ted Ru@@ by on a cor@@ n@@ uc@@ he in the career , stuck to 15 metres above the soil .
A technical rescue team of C@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fi@@ re-@@ fighters rush@@ ed to the scene and took to recall Ru@@ by using an animal to transport it to the top of the c@@ lif@@ f .
An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton ’ s technical expert , An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton , said : “ It was in a precarious situation . ”
She was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , 15 at the top of the summit and 15 on the soil .
She did not move at all during the rescue – it was frozen .
But it is going well now .
She e@@ aten b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
It was a very unusual call .
It is incredible that someone noticed the dog .
The Technical Re@@ li@@ ef specialist Peter L@@ u said : “ Ru@@ by had a great deal of chance of getting out of it un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed . ”
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was carried out in the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for monitoring ; its general state was satisfactory , apart from the exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
M@@ iss H@@ all , of H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ I was terri@@ fied by looking after the relief . ”
First of all , I did not think it was up there .
It was surprising to have it in our arms again .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian said that if she had been too exhausted and that she had van@@ ished she would probably have fallen .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ades have been pat@@ ching up .
What they did was really courageous .
They are so grateful to them , each of them has been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ ei@@ gh@@ ley , added : &apos; We were afraid that she was falling , but she did not move . &apos;
The fire bri@@ g@@ ades were sup@@ pressed .
I do not think she was up there .
D@@ ick J@@ ag@@ ger says that he never dre@@ am@@ ed K@@ at@@ y Per@@ ry when she was 18 .
During an interview during an Austr@@ ali@@ an radio broadcast this week , the po@@ p star said that she was ch@@ or@@ us about J@@ ag@@ ger ’ s s@@ ong “ O@@ ld H@@ ard H@@ ard . ”

Beijing ’ s Pe@@ ac@@ eful Islamic Movement
&apos;@@ Support behind the attack has come from the Islamic Movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan in Central and Western Asia &apos; , said the bos@@ s of the Chinese security bodies on a television channel in Hong Kong , according to a video on the Internet on a website on Thursday evening .
Mar@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party ( CC@@ P ) , was speaking in T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent on an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time that a Chinese official has appointed a particular organisation after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three U@@ igh@@ urs from the same family of the Muslim X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang region of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , a border of several Central Asian countries , ha@@ st@@ ened their petrol bi@@ g@@ gy cars against the entry of the City banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and his mother died in the car fire .
The E@@ ti@@ m , which dec@@ la@@ res itself to be fighting for the independence of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan , the former Chinese X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , was ran@@ ked by the UN in 2002 among al-@@ Qaeda organisations .
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic unrest in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is challenged by several experts .
George Ker@@ ev@@ an : The break@@ -up of Europe gives the S@@ co@@ ts the choice .
Another day , another worrying story of independence .
This time , we are being told that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to be able to join the EU .
Now we are talking about passport control stories in Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wi@@ re border along the H@@ ad@@ Nothing Wall .
While Stra@@ ath@@ th@@ y@@ de &apos;s newspaper pointed out the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it was not in the headlines ( and that was to be expected ) .
Nor has anyone said that the EU Member States spend much of their time circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance with the rules would be a tiny concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from S@@ co@@ ts .
It is therefore a story that is not one of them .
And it is now a history that it is now fixed : I have for the first time heard the b@@ ob@@ by that “ independence means passport control ” more than 40 years ago .
However , an interesting point in this interpretation of an old du@@ sty tal@@ e has been forgotten .
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe , in fact ?
Why exchange the y@@ o@@ ke in London against that of Brussels , particularly now ?
This is the real story about Europe : the great post@@ war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is permanently st@@ alled .
With the euro crisis , the European Pro@@ ject is officially dead .
Ac@@ ross Europe , parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Al@@ ter@@ native Al@@ ter@@ native for Germany , based only this year and from nowhere , gathered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and brought the Liberal Democratic Party ( the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) to the B@@ unde@@ sta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the creation of a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , coupled with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket of national economies through accession to the single currency , led many people to believe that the European Pro@@ ject has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – that was true only for Greece .
Rather , the European system has put its exchange rate members on a par with German exporters – what German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ing the national currency , southern European countries find themselves with an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany .
The only recourse is to make cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper un@@ ease about productivity in Europe .
After the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidi@@ ze the French and German energy sector at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US .
This is a draw@@ back draw@@ back in terms of costs , as we have seen already in Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ outh .
All wage g@@ ates in the world will not prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being penalised by cheap US sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the growing revol@@ t , particularly in France , is one of the EU &apos;s great leaders .
After the war , the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy damaged .
As a result , Mar@@ ine Le Pen ’ s extreme right-wing party , the anti-@@ European National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , leaving the third country to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division of the right will automatically favour the left .
What is Mar@@ ine Le Pen doing with his new popularity with the French white working class ?
It wants to use next year &apos;s European elections to create a single anti-@@ European and anti-@@ European bloc in the European Parliament .
If the anti-@@ European parties are the right ones in these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , the anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not go away , but it will come back to something that will be more like the &apos; Europe of the United Nations &apos; of General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency again .
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project , and I hope that it will turn a blind eye to the United States .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic .
And what about Scotland ?
We can decide to be a small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending in Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could come to terms with a fre@@ er European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe .
Otherwise , we should em@@ ul@@ ate Norway and maintain our economic independence .
The S@@ N@@ P ’ s S@@ N@@ P is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-@@ austerity political movement in Europe , as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 , based on its opposition to the Labour Chancellor ’ s proposed ( and implemented ) cuts , Al@@ is@@ ta@@ ir Dar@@ ling and the subsequent Conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition .
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
E@@ arly H@@ P@@ V : Li@@ ving earlier
Stu@@ dies show that young Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than white girls .
P@@ hy@@ si@@ cal Change does not mean that pub@@ er@@ ty is imminent .
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity could be a trigger for early pub@@ er@@ ty .
The L@@ im@@ its to E@@ arly F@@ ish is not as pronounced among boys
The former correspon@@ dent of C@@ N@@ N P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journalist who speci@@ alises in family and health issues in the child .
Should a mother worry whether his daughter &apos;s se@@ ins and p@@ ins are beginning to grow to seven or eight years ?
At the annual conference of the American A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ ics , which took place this week to Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Dr Paul K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child care , explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young people . American and a new standard .
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general , it does not indicate a rapid shift toward full pu@@ ber@@ ty , ” K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z said .
There are clear signs of development , such as the bu@@ ff@@ er of the se@@ ins , the po@@ le , and the pu@@ bi@@ al area and the bo@@ di@@ ly sm@@ ell@@ s , are appearing in girls earlier .
But there was only a slight advance in the age of first rules over the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , while it was 12 years three years in 1970 .
“ Once the ch@@ est has started to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear , ” K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of “ Ar@@ l@@ y P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ ls ” – The Es@@ sex Gu@@ ide to C@@ oping with Tha@@ is On the Pro@@ ble@@ m . &apos;
Time is the most precise test of how the pub@@ er@@ ty is to be developed .
There is a debate about what is actually the appearance of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is regarded as &apos; early &apos; when the development of the ch@@ est is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows down or stops – something that a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can follow closely .
More rapid development can justify testing by en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ists to remove serious problems such as tu@@ m@@ ours or k@@ y@@ ards .
There are treatments to delay first rules and to prevent other consequences : a premature ageing of the b@@ ones that can curb growth and a small size in ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
The recommendations on medicinal and hormon@@ al treatment are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .
The psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z is prudent with medicines , but recognises that “ control of pub@@ er@@ ty can alleviate some of the problems of behavior and sen@@ s@@ ation for young girls to be different from others . ”
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
&apos;@@ They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they are going to handle the hygiene issues &apos; , said K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
“ It was a shock , ” a woman who had its first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we had spoken about the rules , it was not being prepared emo@@ tionally .
She returned from the school frigh@@ tened and shocked to be the first among her friends .
There are many the@@ ories raised to the public about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
However , there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages carried by the media are responsible .
boys , like girls , reach their pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z says that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is the epidemic of obesity .
He took part in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9 , which links the fat percentage to the outbreak of pub@@ er@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations .
On a global scale , the mechanisms of early pub@@ er@@ ty seem to be influenced by everything , from economic conditions to the climate , to genes .
Another problem is that , despite the fact that boys are in a better position , the trend towards real care is not as high as in girls .
Other doctors at the A@@ A@@ P conference stressed the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ca@@ ke and the pu@@ dding is common , even in inf@@ ants and small ones .
&apos;@@ We must be careful about the way in which we identify the true appearance of the pu@@ ber@@ ty &apos; , said the Dr L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist working in the hospital for Gor@@ ye@@ st@@ ur@@ b , New Jer@@ se@@ y , in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents should not hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ ians to know how to speak with their children .
“ This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than expected , ” explained K@@ a@@ pl@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
If you remain calm , your child will respond in general .
G@@ ir@@ ls whose early pub@@ er@@ ty must be reassured that even when it comes sooner than expected , the process is part of life .

He is accepting the re@@ plac@@ ements that have been lifted in the stu@@ di@@ os .
Without a home , he turns a blind eye to his friends who still want to receive him .
The P@@ layer of docu@@ mentary
&apos;@@ His relationship with success is tortured , that is what is of interest to us : a mix@@ ture of bad luck , a bo@@ y who is not there at the right time , who is not a career , but integr@@ ates , with self-@@ destructive behaviour &apos; , said to the E@@ th@@ an Co@@ en press , crow@@ ned with his H@@ or@@ ry Jo@@ el from several O@@ sc@@ ars and P@@ ric@@ es in C@@ ann@@ es .
If L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is did not exist , the two f@@ ans of mad music were built on their history on real person@@ alities like the mad mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an D@@ a@@ ve V@@ on R@@ on@@ k .
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Green@@ w@@ ich , the New York neigh@@ bor@@ hood that would become &quot; the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the fol@@ k music that would lead to international st@@ ars &quot; as the journalist E@@ li@@ j@@ ah Wal@@ d , a friend of Van R@@ on@@ k , wrote .
The film then comes from docu@@ mentary evidence , from the du@@ sty 3@@ 3@@ T music label to 3@@ 3@@ T invented in@@ hab@@ ited by an old secre@@ tary , to the mu@@ si@@ cal choices of the stu@@ di@@ os of the time and to the c@@ af@@ es where the sing@@ ers were taking place .
The bre@@ thre@@ n ’ s magic is still operating in a fun@@ ny way of constantly crossing the film : a wonderful k@@ ne@@ e-@@ jer@@ k c@@ at in the eyes of the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft com@@ ra@@ de of L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is .
When asked about the way in which he made up his person , the actor and sing@@ er Justi@@ n Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke reminded us of having &apos; grown up in the T@@ n@@ es@@ es@@ e@@ e , ba@@ ked by b@@ light and the b@@ ann@@ y &apos; .

As L@@ le@@ w@@ n D@@ av@@ is , who refuses to compromise on his music , the star is that in a career , “ the most important thing is not to allow ourselves to be bo@@ gged down by anything that prevents us from expressing our views . ”

D@@ em@@ on@@ ers qu@@ arre@@ l about the wid@@ th of seats , while large orders are at stake .
The dispute is ri@@ fe between the major aircraft manufacturers about the wid@@ th of the seats of the tourist class on long-@@ ha@@ ul flights , pa@@ ving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical sal@@ on which is taking place in months .
The conflict is about the wid@@ th of the seats proposed on long-@@ ha@@ ul flights to economic class passengers – which are not always the most cour@@ te@@ ous by the airlines , but to which the allocated area is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the last aircraft presented by Airbus and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week , Airbus called on the aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 chic@@ ken ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but the great American rival Bo@@ eing states that it should be the airlines that decide .
The dispute erup@@ ted when the avi@@ gers were seeking to sell even larger versions of their long-@@ running long-@@ running aircraft , hoping possibly for a record in the event from 17 to 21 November .
The way in which seats are prepared for the back of the plane – in particular , there will be 9 or 10 seats head on – is essential for the economic performance of the ‘ mini-@@ ju@@ ice ’ seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says that its &apos; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X &apos; re@@ designed will be able to welcome into the economy of 40@@ 6 people in seats of more than 17 ch@@ ick@@ ens and will be confi@@ gu@@ red with 10 seats .
Airbus says that the rival version of its A@@ 350 will transport the economy of 350 people into seats of 18 ch@@ ick@@ ens from 9 .
The aircraft gi@@ ants often exchange b@@ lows on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus is directly appealing to the public before the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical sal@@ on , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We have recently been able to see what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financi@@ ers of a pho@@ to showing three people in a restaur@@ ant in the restaur@@ ant , entitled ‘ Do you accept that ? ’
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ ha@@ ul flights in tighter seats than in the regional Turk@@ ish-@@ Turkish aircraft &apos; , said John Le@@ ah@@ y , Airbus &apos;s commercial director .
As eating habits change , people grow , but the seats in aircraft have not changed dramatically .
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when Bo@@ eing ’ s ju@@ m@@ bo 7@@ 47 defined the modern mail journey , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American between 40 and 49 has risen by 10 % , according to the US Department of Health ’ s data .
The size of the average average in the twenty-first century is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 chic@@ ken , according to American health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival cl@@ ings to a concept of sie@@ ge that dates back to the 1950 ’ s , when the f@@ lec@@ tion of the f@@ res@@ h@@ ed apparatus was narrow@@ er .
Airbus has added that it has commissioned a study which indicates that another chic@@ ken at the level of the seats would improve the quality of the sle@@ ep of 53 % .
Bo@@ eing is challenging Airbus &apos;s figures with regard to the wid@@ th of seats and says that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment .
He also says that the study shows that the cab@@ in experience does not depend solely on the wid@@ th of seats .
&apos;@@ It really is a question of bringing flexibility to the airlines and enabling them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , said K@@ ent C@@ ra@@ rer , in charge of the passengers &apos; satisfaction .
They do not want to tell them what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it is more a matter of having a certain degree of freedom of movement , but for suppliers , it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute is a race for aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $ 700 ( $ 700 ) at the market price in decades to come , enough to til@@ t the US and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters first indicated in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the most recent appli@@ ances .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing all claim a return per seat in their latest models of 20 % more than that of the market leader in this seg@@ ment , the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ E@@ R of 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing partly depends on the compar@@ ability of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X with 10 seats , and a model 7@@ 77 of which is confi@@ gu@@ red from 9 .
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the de@@ vice that is set up with 10 seats which are currently in service .
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing does this in order to be able to hi@@ re more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products &apos; , said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , the head of Con@@ High P@@ ass@@ er for the European Airbus avi@@ ger .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say that the boo@@ ths that are confi@@ gu@@ red with 10 seats in the existing 7@@ 77 are suggesting that many passengers are in favour of a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper fa@@ res .
&apos;@@ The 18 chic@@ ken wid@@ th would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , Airbus &apos;s proposal is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 , &apos; said the in-@@ house in-@@ house expert Mar@@ ary Kir@@ by , foun@@ der and ed@@ it@@ or-@@ in-@@ chief of R@@ G@@ ir@@ l Network .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers , including airlines .
The ven@@ d@@ ors of aircraft who are around the world are taking a me@@ tre away from them to check the competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While ven@@ turing to offer comfortable appli@@ ances , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-@@ cost airline companies and regional tri@@ ps .
Airbus offers an A@@ 350 with 10 seats , but it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus stressed the need for greater person@@ alization of cab@@ ins by offering wider seats to some of its aircraft .
Without the support of the only large manufacturer of large modern appli@@ ances , experts say that it is unlikely that his call for the aviation industry to put in place a large standard for seats , but that he could make the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X sales wave forget .
The R@@ is@@ k ’ s Sha@@ its irrit@@ ated by the El@@ l@@ en salary
A majority of CO@@ Ms voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the foun@@ der and Director-General Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , in view of his group &apos;s financial performance .
The vote is not binding , but will tar@@ nish the image of Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , the world ’ s third largest fortune , just as his ship ’ s victory in the US Cup .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire still holds 25 % of the capital group ’ s capital that he co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
Last year , E@@ l@@ ison had already voted against his remuneration .

The new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking .
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
Only one do@@ se of the vaccine has been able to protect the life of nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction .
Other tests are needed before they begin to test human beings , but Professor R@@ on@@ ald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of the We@@ ill Cor@@ n@@ ell , New York , has said that the first signs are encouraging .
&apos;@@ We very much hope that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exha@@ u@@ sting all the methods currently available on the market , but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches &apos; , said by Professor Cor@@ n@@ ell .
The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus is selec@@ tively infec@@ ting the li@@ ver cells , which are then beginning to produce a regular stream of anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies betra@@ y all nic@@ ot@@ ine m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules present in the blood system and neutr@@ alise them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having its do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
When tests were carried out , the vacc@@ inated m@@ ice that was subsequently made nic@@ ot@@ ine continued their activity normally .
But the m@@ ice that had not been vacc@@ inated were “ al@@ la@@ yed , ” said the researchers , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
The experiences are described in the Science Trans@@ x@@ on@@ al Medic@@ ine magaz@@ ine .
Pre@@ vious tobacco products have proved ineffective because they contain anti@@ bodies .
In@@ jec@@ tions had to be repeated so frequently that anti@@ bodies are still high that they are too expensive and cheap .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower , because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al has said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe , it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
“ They will know that , if they start to smoke again , they will not be happy about the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and that will help them to lose their bad habit , ” he added .
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have pointed out that much more research is needed .
Pakistan \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s Head of Taliban killed by a dr@@ one
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ southern , was killed in a US strike on Friday in Pakistan , and has been taught to the security services .
The death of H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ southern has been announced several times in the past .
But intelligence officials , the army , as well as activis@@ t forces said this time that he had lost his life in this strike , conducted in the North W@@ az@@ ir@@ istan region .
&apos;@@ We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ southern was killed in a dr@@ one fire &apos; , said a senior safety officer .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister N@@ awa@@ z Shar@@ if , travelling to London , informed the British Government that discussions had been initiated with the Te@@ h@@ ri@@ k e Taliban Pakistan ( T@@ T@@ P ) , Pakistan &apos;s Taliban movement .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies O@@ be@@ i@@ d
South Wales ’ s former Lab@@ or minister , Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di , will be investigated by the state ’ s anti-@@ corruption regulator .
Former Minister for South Wales , Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di , denied change to trade policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three goods in the govern@@ ment-@@ controlled area .
On Friday , the Independent Commission , I@@ CA@@ C , extended its investigation into whether Mr O@@ be@@ id had put pressure on several state ministers to renew his b@@ ars in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four , where the O@@ be@@ ds have two restaur@@ ants and a coffee after that . Their expiry in August 2005 , without a call for ten@@ ders .
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr Tri@@ po@@ di was aware of Mr O@@ be@@ i@@ d &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ po@@ le , on Thursday .
During the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government lob@@ bi@@ ed for a call for tender .
The ten@@ ants were against and also wanted longer periods .
In 2009 , the bi@@ ds about C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four , which reported to the O@@ be@@ d ’ s about $ 2.5 per year , were renewed without a call for ten@@ ders .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was Minister of Por@@ ts of February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of ten@@ ders .
However , he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr O@@ be@@ id who , as Mr Tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged , called for a change in the government &apos;s policy on b@@ als .
The trans@@ cri@@ ption of telephone convers@@ ations presented to the I@@ CA@@ C showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who came to the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of Mr O@@ bed in the Ministry of Fo@@ ves . .
“ The subject discussed in these telephone convers@@ ations was the development of policy on trade ? ” asked the deputy Commissioner An@@ th@@ ony W@@ he@@ al@@ ly to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
‘ No ’ , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di replied .
I do not remember what we discussed , but in any case it was not that .

Israeli War planes targeted at Syria , declaring an official
Israeli war@@ planes reached a target in Syria ’ s port city of La@@ ap@@ k@@ ia on Thursday evening , confirming a military official in Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The person responsible did not specify what the target was , but said that there was at least one .
The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress reports that the target was SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 Russian manufacturing missiles .

Foreign workers with a visa 4@@ 57 may have a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test .
The government is currently examining the possibility of setting up a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 4@@ 57 while considering extending repressive measures .
The test , if it is adopted , would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent visas from 4@@ 57 from being used to fill un@@ skilled posts or as a back@@ door way to bring his family and friends into Australia .
A working document from the government was un@@ ve@@ iled today , when the Labour MEP M@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w denounced the government dis@@ course on foreign workers , saying that it could off@@ end Australia ’ s neighbors .
“ The fr@@ acti@@ ous statements on “ str@@ ang@@ ers to the end of the qu@@ e@@ ue ” and &quot; jobs for the Austr@@ ali@@ ans first &quot; are a dis@@ agre@@ eable return at the time when trade unions called for a protected labor market , said to the Austr@@ ali@@ a Indian Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , this meant that the wh@@ ites ’ work had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region were to see this as an echo of this historical arena .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by former Minister of Im@@ mi@@ migration Ch@@ ris Bow@@ en .
Im@@ migration Minister B@@ rend@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings , has implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being examined .
If the &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; criterion was adopted , a visa applicants could be checked to find out : &apos; If the supply of employment is genuine in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person who is involved in the spons@@ or &apos; .
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be required to declare the number of holders of visas 4@@ 57 after some of them , having intended to spons@@ or a small number of workers , actually employed hundreds of them .
In the meantime , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old Sri Lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker would have died of a heart attack after having arrived on a boat carrying asylum seekers on the island of Chris@@ t@@ mas this week .

A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the H@@ S@@ 2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d &apos;s work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start from the start of the P@@ ha@@ se 1 in 20@@ 26 .
The Transport Minister , Baroness K@@ ra@@ er , has said that the project &apos; would bring together the United Kingdom &apos; .
The Scottish Transport Minister , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown , said ‘ exc@@ ite ’ the idea of working with the British Government on the project .
P@@ ha@@ se 1 will be on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When P@@ ha@@ se 2 will be completed , the lines will serve Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England , from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7 to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 .
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement in the length of journeys for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travelling times between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh of three hours at the most .
Baroness K@@ ra@@ mer said : ‘ Our objective for H@@ S@@ 2 is a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together ’ .
We are pushing the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the advantages it has are enormous .
Without it , we have a problem with the capacity of our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connec@@ tivity between the 18 major British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ is@@ ta@@ ir Car@@ m@@ cha@@ l , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland &apos; .
For the Scottish Government , K@@ e@@ it@@ h Brown has called on Mr Car@@ mi@@ ha@@ l to give his &apos; unequivocal &apos; support to Scotland &apos;s inclusion in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr Brown said : &apos; The high-speed train has the potential to bring considerable economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings Scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network throughout Britain .
‘ We are therefore exc@@ ited about the idea of working in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland , creating an advantage for everyone and comple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
‘ I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and we will then decide on the next steps . ’
The rules on the use of on-@@ board electronic devices are currently in force in Australia .
Austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers will have to continue to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their t@@ ab@@ lets and s@@ mar@@ ph@@ on@@ ies during the take@@ -@@ off and landing despite the US move to sof@@ ten the regulation of electronic appli@@ ances .
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch vide@@ os , or play games on their appli@@ ances during critical flight periods , provided that they are on the plane .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do so for much of the flight , but many people find it difficult not to be able to access their electronic books during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
The Austr@@ ali@@ an ha@@ uli@@ ers are examining the decision which obliges US carriers to carry out important work to meet the requirements , but has indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the immediate future .
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has also stated that it is examining the announcement , but has pointed out that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment during critical flight periods are still in force in Australia .
‘ CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft ’ , it said .
The issue is the subject of a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to guarantee permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety features of crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , who has already spoken to CA@@ SA about its intention to extend the use of its enter@@ tainment system on board the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology , was open to change , but said that it would follow the regulator .
‘ We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA , which would allow the use of electronic appli@@ ances , because we really do believe that this would improve the customer ’ s experience now that we have a enter@@ tainment system on our aircraft on our aircraft ’ , has indicated a spokes@@ person .
Q@@ an@@ t@@ as said that it is currently complying with the current rules .
&apos;@@ In line with our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we do not intend to change that immediately &apos; , she said .
The FA@@ A ’ s decision applies to US airlines .
However , we are always interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For American carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as a review of tex@@ t@@ books , training equipment , the transfer of hand lu@@ gg@@ age and the provision of instructions to passengers .
&apos;@@ As soon as an airline checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use ligh@@ tw@@ eight electronic devices , such as t@@ ab@@ lets , electronic books and s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ ies to all al@@ titudes &apos; , said the FA@@ A .
In the few cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances during landing .
The group also recommended that the heavi@@ er aircraft be safely placed under seats or in higher compar@@ tments during take@@ -@@ off and landing .

The Singapore l@@ enders profit from the middle classes who were forced to tighten their bel@@ ts .
In a len@@ der on the commercial center of B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani A@@ mit@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a dis@@ charges a bra@@ ke , a jo@@ ke , and a p@@ ary of gold inter@@ c@@ les to pay for his d@@ augh@@ ters ’ scho@@ oling .

Although it ear@@ ns $ 3@@ ,000 from Singapore ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) per month as an ad@@ mis@@ ator , and its hus@@ band also works , the monthly family income is not enough , it says .
In fact , demand is such in parts of Sou@@ theast Asia – where household debt is rising – that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , where she has carried out its transaction , has become the third loan company to be introduced on the Singapore stock market this week .
En@@ suring je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a quick means of obtaining cash – $ 1@@ ,@@ 300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs A@@ mi@@ r@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but it is almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank lending .
In general , the Singapore l@@ enders are raising an annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by United O@@ ver@@ se@@ as Bank , a local donor with a branch in the same business center .
But credit l@@ enders have the advantage that they do not seek solvency or pay evidence , and can un@@ lock loans more quickly than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region turn to home l@@ enders while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and over-@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by a monetary policy that is too lax in advanced economies , low-@@ income and middle-@@ income families are turning to home l@@ enders to fill the gap while their economies are slowing .
This week , Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ C ’ s rating agency cited the growing indeb@@ tedness of households , mainly resulting from the rise in mortgages , as a risk factor for Asian banks ’ cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore recorded the debt-@@ to-@@ GDP ratio of the highest G@@ ross Dom@@ es@@ tic Produc@@ t in Asia .
Malaysia comes at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , while this rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists are also fe@@ ar@@ ful of the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has recently emerged from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
“ The balance sheet is that , with rising costs , people in the middle or at the bottom &#91; of the scale of wages &#93; seek to supplement their income as they can ’ , S@@ ong Sen@@ g W@@ u@@ n , an economist at CI@@ M@@ B , is an Malay@@ sian bank .
His@@ tor@@ ically high gold prices over the last two years have meant that people have been quick to put their personal effects into effect in order to ta@@ p into the value of cash in their je@@ well@@ ery .
In Singapore , approximately 70 % of the articles put in the evidence in the 200 loan shops in relation to the state of the state are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us put the gold chain of grand@@ mothers and you will be looking for it next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest loan operator , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , has recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months .
The increase is such in the loan sector on the loan that V@@ alum@@ e@@ x , the shop operator in B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er and 15 other shops such as this in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia .

Society will finance them by using 60 % of the 66 Singapore of Singapore that it removed this week during its introduction to the Singapore Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change .
While some low-@@ interest l@@ enders have met with criticism of the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates they practice , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah says that marketing offers not only lower rates than the other l@@ enders , but that it does not increase debt directly .
“ The customers are mortg@@ aging goods that they already possess , and mone@@ tiz@@ ing their personal assets does not increase household debt , ” it says .
Mar@@ ke@@ ting is more and more socially acceptable as a means of securing short-term financing .
The people who travel to the home l@@ enders are not only those who have financial problems .
The aff@@ lu@@ ent people of Singapore also go to the loan shops on guarantees and to the Ro@@ le@@ x b@@ ing@@ les , which can account for up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash .
We see clients from all sections of society .
“ It may be easy for people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment activities , or small businesses that have c@@ ash@@ -@@ flow needs to cross a difficult course , ” adding M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .

A M@@ ail ’ s S@@ cu@@ p@@ ment of the T@@ as@@ an@@ ia ’ s Health S@@ cu@@ p@@ ment
The federal government maintains that the $ 3@@ 25 M rescue package for the vac@@ ill@@ ating health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that government government does not waste money .
The Federal Minister of San@@ ta T@@ op@@ se@@ k announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is currently taking &apos; urgent measures &apos; to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system .
Fun@@ ding over four years was decided after government consultations with the independent T@@ as@@ man@@ ia MEP , An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&apos;@@ The government has proposed an emergency rescue package which , in our view , will solve the unique difficulties faced by the state &apos; , said Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
The $ 3@@ 25 M plan includes a $ 31 ( $ 31 ) campaign for non-@@ urgent sur@@ gical operations .
2 600 additional operations , particularly in the area of or@@ th@@ opa@@ e@@ dic sur@@ ger@@ y and cat@@ ar@@ act , will help to catch up .
Funds are also provided for clin@@ ics without meeting H@@ ob@@ art and L@@ au@@ c@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ ton , better external care , training of medical frameworks , mental health services , and deployment of electronic medical records in local hospitals .
“ These investments respond to the idea that , according to first-@@ line clin@@ ic@@ ians , it is the best way to cure T@@ as@@ man@@ ia ’ s health care system , ” she said .
The Minister said that the government of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia would be faced with a strict regime of reporting and reporting .
The state will have to maintain the current levels of funding to receive money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and to prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends the additional funds .
A committee of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said today that the $ 3@@ 25 million will not count for very much ‘ unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will help to consolidate the public health system of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia ’ .
Nevertheless , he congratulated the government on having responded to the request for urgent assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&apos;@@ I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system in T@@ as@@ man@@ ia on the black@@ list &apos; , said Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie .
According to government government , these non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts .
But the health opposition spokesman Peter Du@@ ut@@ ton believes that today ’ s announcement is a “ ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft solution . ”
“ The reason we are here is that the Labour government with@@ drew $ 4@@ 30 from its health system , ” he said on A@@ BC TV .
We cannot have a state government that extr@@ acts almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth that puts $ 300 , and pre@@ tends that it is a good day .
Mr Du@@ ut@@ ton visited Mrs Paul@@ se@@ k to ensure that no dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , dec@@ la@@ res the supervisory body .
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and weapons filled with toxic gas , declared the international chemical arms monitoring body on Thursday , while violent clashes were ra@@ ging in the north of the country , near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian milit@@ ants also declared Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago .
The Organization for the Ch@@ em@@ icals of Ch@@ em@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons ( ICA@@ O ) has arrived one day in advance on the deadline of the
1 November set by the Hague Organisation ordered in Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &apos; un@@ us@@ able &apos; all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mi@@ xing toxic gases and filling am@@ muni@@ tion .
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Dam@@ as@@ cus chemical weapons by mid-@@ 2014 .
As a result of the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
It is believed that the country has around 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons , in particular mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the s@@ ar@@ in ner@@ ve agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was ra@@ ging in the town of Sa@@ fi@@ ra on Thursday which , according to the experts , is home to a unit of production of chemical weapons and storage sites , reported the Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights in Britain .
The group of milit@@ ants , following the development of the human balance sheet through a network of milit@@ ants based in Syria , said on Thursday that 120 2@@ 96 people were dead .
Among them , it is estimated that there were 61 0@@ 67 civilians , including 6 3@@ 65 children .
On the government side , it is estimated that 29 9@@ 54 members of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad ’ s armed forces died , with 18 6@@ 78 fighters from the pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 of Lebanese Hezbollah activists .
Among the dead , it is also estimated that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ ters and some 5 3@@ 75 of opposition fighters , many of whom were foreign .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since .
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country due to the conflict .
Assad ’ s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom have been linked to al-@@ Q@@ a ’ id@@ a groups , to Sa@@ fi@@ ra for weeks .
The Centre said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but did not give any prec@@ ision .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsen@@ al in the midst of a long-@@ lasting civil war .
A statement by the IA@@ C , which is working closely with the UN , indicated that its team was “ now satisfied that it has controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery intended for mi@@ xing and filling . ”
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was planned for the moment &apos; .
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They have not been able to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety , have indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the ICA@@ O said that the two sites were , according to Syria , &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether Sa@@ fi@@ ra &apos;s unit was one of the two sites that the ICA@@ O inspectors could not visit .
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons , which was approved the following month by the ICA@@ O Executive Committee .

The cause of the explosion remains unknown , he added .
T@@ oler@@ ance caused by the death sentence on one of Bali &apos;s bomb post@@ ers
The survi@@ v@@ ors and relatives of the 20@@ 2 people who were killed in the attacks in Bali in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence imposed on the last of the con@@ spir@@ ators to be brought to justice , saying that U@@ mar P@@ ate@@ k should be shot by an execution squ@@ ad .
P@@ at@@ ek , who spent almost 10 years on flight by being one of the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after men in South-East Asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in attacks .
He could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
The 4@@ 5-@@ year-old man was found guilty of mass killing for the attacks aimed at two nigh@@ t-@@ bo@@ xes in Ku@@ ta ’ s popular tourist district , which caused the deaths of 20@@ 2 people , 88 of whom were Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and caused many people to be injured .
It was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
Public prosecu@@ tors have asked for a life sentence , yet they could have asked for the man , described as &apos; D@@ em@@ oli@@ a M@@ an &apos; for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs , to be sentenced to death .
The decision has revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Pe@@ king who lost his two tw@@ in tw@@ in by 39 years , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction perpetrated by P@@ at@@ ek and the other con@@ spir@@ ators almost 10 years ago .
On the brink of te@@ ars , she said that P@@ ate@@ k should have been sentenced to death .
I really think that it should have followed the same path as the other men .
“ He should be dra@@ gged to death , ” Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en said to the A@@ PA .
I have to live every day without having other grand@@ children or seeing my d@@ augh@@ ters .
Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , charged to an external g@@ ate , explo@@ ded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in P@@ ad@@ dys@@ s B@@ ar when a k@@ am@@ ik@@ a@@ ze j@@ um@@ ped with a do@@ se ba@@ g with explo@@ si@@ ves barely 20 seconds earlier .
He s@@ ank into a com@@ a in the aftermath of the attack and remained un@@ conscious for a month , and he was “ dead ” three times when he was under res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that P@@ ate@@ k should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah responsible for the car@@ n@@ age – Am@@ ros@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ h@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ ra – who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
To keep him alive , why , there is no reason to keep him alive .
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 20@@ 2 people and injured hundreds of others is not a great deal .
P@@ at@@ ek was the last of the Bali bom@@ bers to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being cap@@ tured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Ab@@ bot@@ t@@ ab@@ d , where American forces will kill the former al-@@ Qaeda leader , Os@@ ama bin Laden , less than four months later .
During the trial , an agent of the F@@ B@@ I said that intelligence reports revealed that P@@ ate@@ k was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al Qaeda .
‘ He did not go ’ , he added Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
Until recently , he made a mo@@ ck@@ ery of the gri@@ ef he could have caused to other people .
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attacks that will be held later this year and marked by cere@@ monies in Bali and Australia .
‘ There will be a lot of be@@ aches this year ’ , Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en said .
However , P@@ at@@ ek can appeal for his condemnation .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on board aircraft ( but not an appeal with their mobile phones ) .
Air@@ lines ’ passengers will be able to use their g@@ ate@@ way electronic devices to read , work , play games , watch films , and listen to music – but not on their mobile phone – under the new directives that the Federal Aviation Administration has published on Thursday .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which the change will be in place will vary from one airline to another , declared the adminis@@ tr@@ ator of the FA@@ A Mic@@ hael H@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
The airlines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training tex@@ t@@ books of crew members and the rules on the collection of appli@@ ances to be in conformity .
The FA@@ A said that it had already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of electronic devices on their aircraft .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ B@@ lu@@ e are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
‘ In depending on the plan , we could approve an extended use of the electronic appli@@ ances very soon ’ , the FA@@ A indicated in a statement .
At present , passengers must ext@@ ingu@@ ish their s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ es , t@@ ab@@ lets and other appli@@ ances as soon as the g@@ ates of the aircraft are closed .
They are not supposed to s@@ cra@@ p them before the plane reaches an al@@ titude of 10 000 feet and the comm@@ ander gives the go@@ -@@ ahead .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances at the plane ’ s des@@ cent before landing and not r@@ all@@ ying them until the plane has been up .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their appli@@ ances during take@@ -@@ off , landing and ro@@ tation on the ground , has declared the FA@@ A .
Most of the new air@@ planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i at higher levels , should meet the criteria .
As the Chair of the Association of Pro@@ f@@ es@@ al Fa@@ th@@ h@@ t , the chairman of the Association of Pro@@ f@@ ers , has been happy with these changes .
‘ Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with the carriers for this – it will be of benefit to everyone , explained G@@ l@@ ass in a statement .
We are , frankly , tired of feeling that we are &apos; room supervis@@ ors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet for sur@@ f@@ ing , exchange em@@ ail@@ s and SM@@ S , or down@@ load data below 10 000 feet , have declared the agency .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their s@@ mar@@ ph@@ es , t@@ ab@@ lets , t@@ ab@@ lets and other appli@@ ances .
So , still not in Wor@@ ds W@@ it@@ h Fri@@ ends , the s@@ cra@@ b@@ ble online game that Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ w@@ in played on his s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one in 2011 when he was g@@ ros@@ sly driven out of a American Air@@ lines plane after refusing to ext@@ ingu@@ ish his . At the time the de@@ vice was kept on the do@@ or@@ step .
And heavi@@ er appli@@ ances like lap@@ top@@ s will always have to be brought up because they might hurt someone if they fly through the cab@@ in .
Mob@@ ile tele@@ phones on board will also continue to be banned .
Regul@@ atory power over mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communic@@ ations Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Last month , Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of the National Trans@@ f@@ er Bo@@ ard , the national transport security expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , said that mobile phones were always regarded as posing a risk .
‘ Mob@@ ile tele@@ phones are really a problem , not only because they might perhaps create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know that , according to the F@@ CC@@ C , they could dis@@ rupt mobile phone traffic an@@ ten@@ n@@ as if they are used on board ’ , he said .
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authori@@ zed a wider use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has increased in recent years to rela@@ x restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics such as Sen@@ ator Mc@@ Cas@@ k@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o , maintain that there is no valid security reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of aircraft has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous .
Some studies suggest that at least one third of passengers forget to switch off their appli@@ ances , or are deliberately doing so .
The FA@@ A started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying radi@@ os F@@ M , the then high-tech g@@ ad@@ get .
New air@@ planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
Air@@ lines allow their passengers to use the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i in cru@@ ise al@@ titudes for several years .
The modified aircraft to host W@@ i-@@ F@@ i systems are also better at res@@ isting interference .
The vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should make it possible for electronic equipment to be used more widely under the new directives , said H@@ er@@ t@@ ta .
Today ’ s electronic equipment usually em@@ its radio trans@@ missions that are much weaker than previous generations of appli@@ ances .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic read@@ ers , for example , have only minimum trans@@ missions when we turn to a page .
But the trans@@ missions are stronger when the appli@@ ances are passed or data is sent .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is one of those who press for a rela@@ xation of the restrictions on the use of electronic aircraft by passengers .
In 2011 , company leaders commissioned a K@@ ind@@ le e-@@ books air@@ lin@@ er to fly to see if there were problems , but there were none .
This inspired the members of the FA@@ A Advisory Committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of appli@@ ances is a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said that he thought that the interference from the appli@@ ances was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee have said that there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots indicating that appli@@ ances can interfere with aircraft systems , and that most of them are very old .
However , the committee recommended that the FA@@ A should allow pil@@ ots to ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances during the landing of the instruments under low visibility conditions .
One group of the vo@@ y@@ age industry welcomed the changes , calling for sensible arrangements for travellers with technology .
&apos;@@ We are pleased that the FA@@ A recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security &apos; , has declared Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , President and Director of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tra@@ vel Association .
A dead bir@@ d from a platform in the North Sea has been released in nature .

The Centre ’ s director , Col@@ in S@@ ed@@ don , said : “ This r@@ as@@ ph@@ o of water probably was a winter migratory migratory that came from northern Europe and found itself caught in the midst of violent win@@ ds in the North Sea . ”
It seems that the exhausted bir@@ d would have been able to find refuge in the oil platform .

Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain ?
The Business for Brit@@ west campaign was launched in April with the promise to re@@ unite companies and define what wealth and employment creat@@ ors want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
In order to do this , we commissioned the wid@@ est and most comprehensive investigation of the British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , companies and the EU .
Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , generally representative of all the sizes of companies , sectors and regions of Britain .
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on countries that modern@@ ize and develop while EU states stag@@ n@@ ate .
They want to see the government priori@@ tiz@@ e new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming European institutions .
When asked about specific political points – from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key competences should be returned to West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market caused general dis@@ content , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits to be gained from being part of the European trade area – 40 % of the traditionally most pro-European large companies even agree .
Last but not least , our survey of entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives for treaty change and the development of a trade relationship with the EU , not politics .
This conclusion , which is found in all the large groups and businesses of all sizes , shows that the business world is insisting on a “ significant change ” that re@@ sto@@ res power in the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high – to change the treaty and to represent Britain ’ s interests better would allow a shift of 16 % of the votes to the country ’ s retention of the country in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt about this : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate the terms of Britain &apos;s accession to the EU .
It also shows that companies hope that the re@@ negotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to represent the interests of British companies better , as the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our investigation show , for companies this means once again the focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels .

Alex@@ e@@ i Mill@@ er of Gaz@@ pro@@ m states that the Bulgaria gas pipeline is not a new gas age .
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared Gaz@@ pro@@ m &apos;s director .
‘ An historic event has taken place today : construction began in the Bulgarian part of South Stream , the large-scale project of Europe ’ s largest project ’ , explained by Alex@@ e@@ i Mill@@ er , the Director-General of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole continent of Europe .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its counterparts in Ukraine , which transit the largest part of Russian gas for Europe , increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes , adds the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated &apos; forever &apos; .
Bulgarian consumers will be receiving the gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is put into operation in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m has indicated that construction should start in other countries down@@ stream by the end of the year .
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ in wants to create the world ’ s largest marine reserve .
The island of Pit@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ in wants to create the world ’ s largest marine reserve , announced the daily newspaper the New York ’ s on Thursday , including an information from Rad@@ io Australia .
This island , in the east of the G@@ am@@ bia Ar@@ chi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last British territory of the South Pacific , half@@ way between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory measure 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , if there are three other small close islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the B@@ un@@ ty , an episo@@ de in the history of the English na@@ vy , which gave rise to three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adjustments .
A few dozen inhabitants , most of them des@@ c@@ endants of the B@@ un@@ ty muti@@ l@@ ates , still in@@ habit P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n , and their incomes depend on 95 % of London ’ s generosity .
The Council of Cyprus voted unanimously in favour of creating a marine reserve around the small archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , or 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , which correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
An Deputy May@@ or of the island went to London asking Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ n , the May@@ or of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ in , believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island .
The project must be accepted by the English Govern@@ or of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ re@@ n , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to s@@ na@@ p these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided , however , that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in Pit@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft on the surveillance of the area , and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels .
With regard to France , it must already lead the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 of the French E@@ E@@ Z of Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia &apos;s E@@ E@@ Z , neighbour of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ r@@ n .

P@@ ris@@ on Life for a Former Chinese Deputy Govern@@ or
A former Deputy Govern@@ or of J@@ il@@ in Pro@@ v@@ ince in north-@@ east China was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption .
The Communist Party of July 2012 , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of having affected more than 19 million y@@ u@@ ans of bri@@ bes , reported the official media in China .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Govern@@ or , who was also the president of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public establishment , helped and accountable for contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first interim court in Beijing on his micro@@ lo@@ g .

Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord at a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission .
Two workers in South Wales have been accused of sexual assa@@ ults on children following allegations against Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h &apos;s educ@@ ator , J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lo@@ ord , in 2011 , at a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission for S@@ ex@@ ual S@@ ex@@ ual Ab@@ use of Children .
In his opening statement to the Commission , however , Y@@ M@@ C@@ A said that it &apos; never had to deal with a sexual assault on children within its organisation &apos; .
The Director General Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ re has been asked about two cases : an employee of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A has been accused of infringements of child pornography and a P@@ E &apos;s P@@ E instruc@@ tor of Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all has been found guilty of sexual assa@@ ults on children in the centre where he is working . In 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ re said to the Commission &apos;s Ad@@ voc@@ ate to the Commission that he was aware of the first case , but he was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the opening declaration of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was in@@ accurate by empha@@ si@@ zing that &apos; the external controls of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A have been carried out and have indicated that the safety of children is an absolute priority for the organisation &apos; .
It was demonstrated in the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A had been informed that it had received the more bad opinions of four institutions during a quality audit of the De@@ par@@ te@@ ment of Education and Communic@@ ations carried out in August of this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who began to work in Y@@ M@@ C@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had failed to check that the employees knew that they were obliged to report any violation of children &apos;s security policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord was condemned for sexual assa@@ ults on 12 boys during the two years he worked in Y@@ M@@ C@@ A .
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of six years in prison .
But Mr Ha@@ re rejected the idea that Y@@ M@@ C@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting the de@@ faults of the Lord on the safety of children .
The members of the staff testi@@ fied that they had observed certain shortcomings , in particular the fact that the Lord remained alone with the children , that he kept them priv@@ ately , putting them on his k@@ nees , telling them that he loved them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone .
Dan@@ i@@ el@@ le O@@ k@@ w@@ ell , who was fram@@ ed by Lord and asked for training for the protection of children because she was worried about his behaviour , indicated that she was responsible for the childhood services of Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h , J@@ ac@@ is Bar@@ na@@ at , who would be subject to Lord &apos; Very da@@ un@@ ting and difficult to approach most of the time . ”
The Director-General said that he was rejecting the testi@@ mony of the staff that they were reluctant to point out these shortcomings to their superi@@ ors .
Instead , he said that their friendly relations with Lord have bl@@ ur@@ red their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Ha@@ re said that he had expressed his view before the Council of Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in South Wales that , for the organisation , the lesson of the &apos; J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lo@@ ord incident &apos; should not concern the &apos; reporting &apos; by the staff , and the Council agreed with him .
Mr Ha@@ re said that the decision to sign the staff of the confidentiality agreements , shortly after the allegations have been mentioned , was taken by the Director-General of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A , Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ ley .
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an &apos; excess ze@@ al &apos; and that it had been badly implemented .
The South Wales ’ s Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was not a safe child at the time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord was used , namely between 2009 and 2011 , the expert on sexual violence against children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ m@@ all@@ b@@ one of G@@ ri@@ It is not good enough before the Commission .
He said that there are &apos; serious problems &apos; in the recruitment , monitoring , initi@@ ation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again , but ad@@ mitting that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office , 59 years of his man made his views known on various national policies .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade in the country , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and its role as a special envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process .
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to London ’ s EP@@ ing Stand@@ ard : ‘ Yes , of course , but it may happen , so ... ’
When many of them met in Cardiff to meet and win the tro@@ ph@@ y of the Ch@@ ev@@ al of the year , they knew that the competition would be tough .
But no one expected a three-@@ year-old child to be won .
Not yet in school , and only a few months after having made its first weapons , the t@@ angle and its pon@@ y She@@ t@@ land T@@ off@@ land have tro@@ t@@ ted out for three rounds with great ease and won the first price , leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors .
The two in@@ separ@@ able – the same size – were welcomed for presentation , attitude , and style during the annual contest that took place in the Y@@ un@@ n@@ y@@ bank centre , in R@@ od@@ y near Cardiff .
When he stood against men and women in e@@ leg@@ ant me@@ als , he was wearing his h@@ at a little on the side in a way that was de@@ used to dis@@ pose of his two year old pon@@ y on the run@@ way .
It was welcomed by the judges for his natural qualities of un@@ common comp@@ act for a child of his age .
And T@@ ed@@ e received very good notes for his presentation and personality .
For@@ ced T@@ off@@ é@@ e was present for his 3@@ r@@ d birth@@ day in March of last year , and he has been involved since with his She@@ t@@ land pon@@ y every day .
His 3@@ 0-@@ year-old mother said : &apos; En@@ on and T@@ ed@@ us make an excellent du@@ o &apos; .
They have stood against each other and against all of them , but the two have fl@@ ou@@ ted the le@@ ague of gold and roc@@ kets .
It was only the second time that he was with T@@ off@@ e , and we were glad that he won .
On the run@@ way , people who did not know it thought it was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to be photo@@ graph@@ ed with him .
This bo@@ y , from the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ w V@@ ale , in the south of Wales , follows the foot@@ steps of his a@@ unt Sharon , who has been involved in qu@@ e@@ ues for more than 10 years .
Mrs Howitt said : &apos; There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applau@@ ded it &apos; .
He has come all the length of the run@@ way , and even if he seemed to be small , he did a wonderful job .
En@@ ough of animals – it lo@@ ves hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors , and the rural world , and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens .
In the way he started , he will certainly be taking part in the year ’ s C@@ ev@@ al demonstration – and I am sure he will make a good contribution .
A m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece of the annual survey said : “ Men@@ on is only three years old , but he knows how to drive his pon@@ y . ”
They are a good team .
The judges noticed that F@@ en@@ on and T@@ ed@@ ic@@ us presented well and the way in which they went on the run@@ way .
They seek effective te@@ am@@ work between the pon@@ y and the tra@@ in@@ er – Fol@@ on and T@@ off@@ a were the best on the run@@ way .

A preliminary inquiry showed that the New Ex@@ press belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g Ne@@ ws Group published a number of incorrect articles on the Z@@ o@@ om@@ lic@@ on company between September 2012 and August 2013 .
“ The New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organized , ” the regulator said in a statement .
He indicated that he had decided to &apos; impose a sanction of an administrative nature in Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press card &apos; .
He also “ ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g Ne@@ ws Group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he carry out an investigation into the people responsible in New Ex@@ press and immediately re@@ visit the newspaper ’ s management team . ”
Mr Ch@@ en wrote a number of articles for the New Ex@@ press on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Z@@ o@@ om@@ lic@@ on .
After his arrest , his newspaper twice published an appeal on the front page for his release , writing that he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories about money .
“ In this case , I did not in Z@@ o@@ om@@ lic@@ on as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he said to the public television network C@@ CC@@ TV .
I did so mainly because I was running after money and celebr@@ ity .
I have realised my mistake .
Following Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s apo@@ logy , New Ex@@ press published his apo@@ logy on the front page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects recently turned out to be tele@@ vised .
Experts say that people are systematically forced to go their own way , despite a change in the law that was voted on earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate themselves .
The aircraft carrier Char@@ l@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le in &apos; Un@@ availability &apos;
In T@@ oul@@ on , the aircraft carrier is in short supply .
The radi@@ o-@@ active ste@@ am le@@ ak detected on one of the two nuclear mil@@ ls of Char@@ l@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le , in mid-@@ October and when the ship was at sea , was &apos; safe for the se@@ am@@ en &apos; , but is not without consequences for the na@@ vy .
The Ro@@ yal has just confirmed to us the &apos; un@@ availability &apos; of the vessel until &apos; mid-@@ November &apos; , &apos; time to take the necessary corrective measures &apos; on the reactor .
For its part , the D@@ N@@ C , a defen@@ der of defence , ensures that its teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , des@@ pat@@ ched in the V@@ ar for the time , &apos; are currently involved in the aircraft carrier &apos; .
It is a matter for them , among other things , to change an ap@@ ple on defici@@ ent heating .
&apos;@@ Everything is done to ensure that Char@@ le@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le is able to carry out its planned deployment at the end of 2013 &apos; , but explains the DA@@ C .
And the National Mar@@ ine to certi@@ fy that &apos; it does not call into question the programme of activities of the &apos; nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion &apos; ship .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Char@@ l@@ -@@ de Gaul@@ le is coming out of an interim period of six months .
He had de@@ t@@ ached from T@@ oul@@ on in mid-@@ October for training .
In particular , this is in order to call young people pil@@ ots of hunting .
A &apos; small ch@@ or@@ us &apos; , confined to the reactor &apos;s area of reactor contain@@ ment , then occurred on the flagship ship of the French fleet .
According to the national na@@ vy , the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a great deal of dis@@ content on the part of the people I meet : a mon@@ str@@ ous reass@@ essment of their properties , a flood of taxes , the cost of all kinds of licences , and an end to administrative costs .
In short , there is no limit to our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of dollars squ@@ an@@ dered could be spared in order to allow much respectful taxation of those who pay .
Any money that is taken away from taxpayers will reduce their freedom of consumption and contribute to their impover@@ ishment .
In Sh@@ aw@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , we are not bo@@ thered about s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ary expenditure and the maintenance of lame duc@@ ks : a deficit cultural centre , a strong subsidy to the energy City , etc .
If these plants are not profitable , they are sold to the private company or are dem@@ ol@@ ished .
It is also sad to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of a number of properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come .
However , I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the old W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a sort of industrial inc@@ ub@@ ator , but at what cost to tax pay@@ ers ?
It is not for the public to invest in such companies , but for the private sector on the basis of consumer demand .
The citizens were pleased to learn that the la@@ kes in Fisheries and Pi@@ es will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
Following the departure of all industries ( consumers of water ) and the large decline in the population , the use of water has fallen considerably across the territory .
Without wanting to waste it , the city will never lack water and the severe regulation on its use could be greatly sof@@ tened .
In short , it is easy to achieve a great deal with other people &apos;s money .
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet .
With gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a p@@ en without going through an borrowing regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years with high qualifications for the majority , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse .
D@@ own in a drugs tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway line
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico , with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric ra@@ ils , has been discovered .
The US authorities have described the tunnel by 4 feet 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they have ever seen .
The tunnel , a z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag@@ ant on the same length of time at almost six long-@@ lasting football fields , links w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ ju@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go in the United States .
The area is full of indefin@@ able w@@ are@@ houses , which makes it easy to conceal the tr@@ uc@@ ks in charge of drugs .
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it un@@ noticed , said the authorities .
The authorities seized 8@@ .5 tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel was discovered , according to court cases .
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were accused of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e possession with intent to sell .
They inc@@ ur a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are condemned .
In No@@ g@@ ales , Ari@@ z@@ ona , traffickers use vast underground dra@@ in@@ age channels .
The tunnel is the important eigh@@ th passage in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the biggest tun@@ n@@ els were discovered as a result of the mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in the centre of Mexico in October , posing a challenge to the drug car@@ t@@ els that have to deliver their products quickly to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 y@@ ards f@@ itted with railways that ran from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of a Ti@@ ju@@ ana house and went up to two San Di@@ e@@ go w@@ are@@ houses .
The British police issue an extradition mandate against Ass@@ ange
The British police have now issued an extradition mandate against Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks foun@@ der Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge in the Ecu@@ ador of Ecu@@ ador in London and called for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said that she had issued a “ surrender opinion ” against Austr@@ ali@@ ans by 40 years , asking him to come to a police station , adding that if he did not , he would be likely to be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited in Sweden following the allegations of sexual crime , having exhausted all possible channels under the British law after the Supreme Court invali@@ dated the appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month .
F@@ earing that Stockholm allows its transfer to the US , he found refuge in the Ecu@@ ador ’ s Ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an Ambassador in London on June 19 , asking that South America ’ s country of the South .
Scotland Y@@ ard &apos; issued an opinion against a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man asking him to come to a police station at the time and the time of his choice &apos; , said a spokesman .
It continues to violate the conditions for its release under b@@ ail .
Em@@ bas@@ sy refused to comment on the issuing of the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange fears that he will be extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of es@@ pion@@ age , having un@@ ve@@ iled more than 250 000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website fighting secret information .
How biome@@ tr@@ ics will inv@@ ade our lives
Fin@@ al the f@@ ad words for access to his s@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one or pay for his purchases ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by the biome@@ tr@@ ics of tele@@ phones and computers .
Ber@@ n@@ ard Di@@ di@@ er , the deputy head of Mo@@ ph@@ o , even believes that “ the century will be biometric . ”
Only biome@@ tr@@ ics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in such a trans@@ verse and transnational world as the Internet .
The organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biome@@ tr@@ ics , but they are worried about it .
In 2011 alone and in France , the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorised 7@@ 74 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the form of hand or the ve@@ in@@ ous network of hand in companies , administrations , can@@ te@@ ens ...
&apos;@@ Everyone will soon be identified , anywhere and when &apos; , tre@@ ad Bro@@ o@@ k@@ man , who is responsible for the privacy of consumers in the CD@@ T ( C@@ enter for Democracy and Technology ) , in Washington .
The reasons for such optimism , among some , and pessimis@@ m , among others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics will be based on new techniques , which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used biometric data are fingerprints , the hand of the hand and the ve@@ in@@ ous network of the p@@ ile or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;@@ For example , some people who work in concrete have a very ab@@ ys@@ s of fin@@ gers and their fingerprints are un@@ read@@ able &apos; , noting Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in Ho@@ od , the technical director of the identity domain of Th@@ ales Communic@@ ations .
And the gathering , as well as the verification of the ve@@ in@@ ous network and the hand of the hand , is a voluntary act of the people .
It is both a safety - it cannot be taken for granted - and one disadvantage : the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time .
As a result , research has been carried out for some twenty years on other approaches , such as the recognition of the face or the ic@@ is ( the col@@ our@@ ful part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the sen@@ s@@ ors and the ability to calculate the computers required for the analysis of data , these techniques become operational .
The prec@@ ision of fac@@ ial recognition has increased ten@@ fold over the last five years , calcul@@ ating G@@ y@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ill@@ a , the director of the R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and Holland deployed automatic border cross@@ ings using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or i@@ is on the move .
&apos;@@ Today we are carrying out research on the recognition of voice or on how to walk with noise sen@@ s@@ ors , but we need a silent environment &apos; , according to S@@ ri@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , the head of security research to the In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
The single , inf@@ am@@ ous Mar@@ qu@@ in@@ ur , DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
&apos;@@ In the current state of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirmed by S@@ op@@ hi@@ e V@@ ul@@ li@@ ne@@ t-@@ T@@ av@@ a , Director of the Stu@@ dies , Innovation and Pro@@ spec@@ tive to C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But the DNA analysis is still very long and expensive .
N@@ an is proposed to the judicial police force costing EUR 9@@ 0@@ ,000 to analyse DNA s@@ amples in the place of a crime and in an hour .
The use of biome@@ tr@@ ics is divided into two groups : identification ( recognising one person among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( ensuring that the person is the person it claims to be ) .
The identification so far has been the issuing of identity papers : biome@@ tr@@ ics ( fingerprints , pho@@ to , i@@ is ) , with the information that the state poss@@ esses on all the citizens already sta@@ ked on .
This makes it possible to ensure that a person does not attempt to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison can have other applications .
NE@@ IS proposes the recognition of V@@ I@@ V@@ s at the entr@@ ance to a ho@@ tel or shop .
&apos;@@ We repu@@ di@@ ate the pictures of the surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compare them with the photo@@ graph@@ s of cele@@ bri@@ ties who circul@@ ate freely on the Internet , &apos; explains Dan@@ e N@@ assi@@ f , who is responsible , in N@@ EC France , for commercial development for biometric identi@@ fi@@ ers .
Another use : to take a photo@@ grap@@ h that has qu@@ eu@@ ed up in a shop , following its progress through fac@@ ial recognition and calculating the waiting time .
auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation was initially a matter of physical access ( borders , local protected areas , can@@ te@@ ens ... ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
More recently , it has been added to the presence of the presence of presence .
&apos;@@ One biometric biome@@ tr@@ ics avoi@@ ds the phenomenon of the C@@ op@@ in , which points for another &apos; , justifies G@@ y@@ ri@@ le B@@ at@@ ill@@ a , of Ac@@ cr@@ at@@ at .
More and more , however , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also concern transactions , particularly those made from connected devices to the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric read@@ er : it re@@ places the h@@ ed@@ ging of the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is being tested at V@@ ill@@ en@@ eu@@ us@@ -@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and in An@@ g@@ il@@ a by Nat@@ ural Security in partnership with banks and teachers of the big distribution : when paying in shop with its bank card , the customer does not ta@@ p his code but introduces its own . It is in a read@@ er who scan@@ ns the cal@@ ves .
The experiment is scheduled to last for six months .
If conclu@@ sive , biometric read@@ ers could soon arrive among French traders .
S@@ olu@@ tions to reassure users
There are three ways of making biome@@ tr@@ ics se@@ duc@@ tive in the eyes of the general public .
The first is to explain that it can save time .
&apos;@@ If , thanks to biome@@ tr@@ ics , a cli@@ ent is still in office 30 seconds less , that is good &apos; , explains the director of a large area .
The second is to offer person@@ alised services : in a few years &apos; time , a voice will be able to recognise your voice and propose tail@@ or-@@ made options .
Finally , I would like to reassure you by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;@@ In@@ v@@ estig@@ ations are stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos;s identities are in a second basis : the correlation between the two numbers is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure c@@ able , which is blocked if you try to move it &apos; , lists Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , of Th@@ ales .
But , due to a lack of in-depth studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches are really convincing the users .
Pri@@ v@@ acy specialists continue to worry .
&apos;@@ The progress of fac@@ ial recognition , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and the huge quantity of photo@@ graph@@ s available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ li@@ k@@ r or P@@ ic@@ as@@ a , make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance &apos; , predicted An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , the Commission for the Protection of Pri@@ vate life in Canada .
A driver , at 2@@ 10 km / h , with a warm be@@ verage between the leg@@ s , was given a £ 1@@ 000 am@@ mon@@ t of £ 1@@ 000 .
A motor@@ ist has been fin@@ ed a £ 1@@ 000 fine for driving at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink that is in balance between his leg@@ s .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ i , 35 years of Ti@@ p@@ tre@@ e in Es@@ sex , was re@@ started leading his Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 to B@@ ain@@ tre@@ e on 27 May .
When the police arrested him , they discovered the be@@ verage between his leg@@ s and his leg@@ s .
In the Court of First In@@ stance in Col@@ ch@@ ester , H@@ ow@@ e admitted the conduct of conduct without the necessary prudence and attention .
The seven points of its permit led to a 6 months &apos; withdrawal .
H@@ ow@@ us has also been sentenced to pay costs amounting to £ 90 and a £ 100 per victim .
A Tax on Foreign home@@ owners to bur@@ st the London bubble
The Treasury has provisi@@ onally quanti@@ fied the capital gains tax , but is waiting for a final decision by Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 budget , has put a 7 % stamp on properties costing more than £ 2@@ M and annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold property . In the context of a society rather than individual .
the stamp right already applies to the residential properties of West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ el@@ se@@ a , and to £ 7@@ 08 M in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , The North-@@ East , Nor@@ th@@ west and Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and H@@ um@@ ber region combined .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &apos; As a result of the increase in the right of stam@@ ps on the high value and the introduction of the anti-@@ avo@@ idance law in this area , it is very difficult to make progress on the fact that high-@@ value properties are under-@@ imposed independently of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &apos;
“ But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or current owners who are reluctant to sell , ” he added .
prestige housing – the 5 % to 10 % of the highest prices in the housing market – in the prosperous sou@@ th@@ west London sector that is running out of F@@ ul@@ ham in W@@ im@@ b@@ id@@ on , increased by a record@@ -@@ high 11.@@ 8 % last year .
P@@ ric@@ es in central London are growing year by year in a year of 5.@@ 6 % , but have been ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed by an “ internal market ” that is growing , the sou@@ th@@ west of the city , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and ( 6@@ .5 % ) with a recovery , according to S@@ I think that is the case .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted the way in which a dog &apos;s qu@@ e@@ ue is linked to its mood .
Pre@@ vious studies revealed that happy dogs won their qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while the nerv@@ ous dogs made it more to the left .
But scientists now say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and respond to them .
Professor Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ scientists from the University of T@@ ren@@ te , said : “ Everyone knows that , in humans , the left side and the brain ’ s right are involved in a different way in the stimul@@ i that ar@@ ouse positive or negative emotions . . ”
Here we have tried to see what is happening in other species .
He added that , as in the case of human beings , the right side of the brain to dogs was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and that both hemis@@ p@@ here played a different role in emotions .
To know more about the way in which dogs respond to the dis@@ orderly qu@@ e@@ ue of other dogs , researchers have followed animals that watch mo@@ vi@@ es on other dogs .
They have measured the car@@ di@@ a@@ c frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ue sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a has explained : “ We have presented dogs of films where other dogs contain dogs – or a nat@@ ur@@ alist version is a sil@@ et@@ te to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we have been able to ta@@ p the qu@@ e@@ ue and present it to the left or to the right . . ”
When the animals saw a dog without a qu@@ e@@ ue qu@@ eu@@ ing up to the right ( from the point of view of the dog that qu@@ eu@@ ed ) , they remained perfectly rela@@ xed .
But when they found a qu@@ e@@ ue devi@@ ating mainly from the left ( once again from the point of view of the dog ’ s qu@@ e@@ ue ) , their heart has accelerated , and they seem anxious .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said that he did not think that dogs deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
Rather , it believes that dogs know by experience the movements that they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet on several occasions with other dogs , and if you note that , most of their time , their qu@@ e@@ ue to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude , you will react according to this experience . &apos;
Res@@ ear@@ chers show that the results could enable the owners , ve@@ ts and com@@ ment@@ ators to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The expert in John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a prof@@ essor invited to the Scho@@ ol of Veterinary Sci@@ ences at B@@ ris@@ to@@ l University , made it clear that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the can@@ in species .
Last year , a team from the University of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs turned head to the left when they looked at an aggressive and right-wing dog when it was a jo@@ y@@ ful dog .
And , in another scientific study by Vic@@ tor@@ ia University in Canada , he said : “ The dogs were more easily toward a ro@@ bo@@ t dog when his qu@@ e@@ ue left to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what is in the Italian study . ”
He pointed out that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not entirely consider the animals or ro@@ bo@@ ts as dogs .
A study of the way dogs respond to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
“ Although many elements , found in different ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception . ”
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not be long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ue sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other .

Pope Franc@@ is will name his first car@@ din@@ als in February
Pope Franc@@ is will appoint new Car@@ d@@ in@@ als of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ als are the high@@ est@@ -@@ ranking men in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect him , so Franc@@ is will appoint his first group of men who ultimately choose his successor .
There are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ d@@ in@@ au@@ x .
But , as soon as a car@@ d@@ inal reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer take part in the election of a Pope – that is to say , a group of 120 ’ s voters .
In a statement announcing the new , Fa@@ ther F@@ eder@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ bar@@ di , a V@@ a@@ tic@@ an spokesman , said that a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the ceremony in which b@@ ish@@ ops will be b@@ red to the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as the name . Con@@ fron@@ tal .
“ Pope Franc@@ is has decided to communicate his decision to conven@@ e February in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Car@@ din@@ als in various parts of the world . ”
J@@ ack Val@@ er@@ o of the Catholic V@@ ice has said that by February the number of car@@ d@@ inal car@@ d@@ in@@ ers will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope usually has as many car@@ d@@ in@@ als as he had to do so that the number of car@@ d@@ inal car@@ d@@ in@@ ers could reach 120 and as many of the more than 80 years old as he wanted .
Next year ’ s con@@ is@@ c@@ ise will be important , because it will be the first since Pope Franc@@ is ’ s election in March of this year , said Val@@ er@@ o .
At the moment , there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and , in particular , Italy .
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint car@@ d@@ in@@ als to the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he added .
For@@ ty per cent of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of car@@ din@@ als represent them .
Car@@ din@@ als will also be chosen for the first time since Franc@@ is formed the Car@@ din@@ als Council , a group of eight car@@ d@@ in@@ als from around the world to consider how to reform the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided to decide on his own .
“ From now on , Franc@@ is chose these eight car@@ d@@ in@@ als to help him ’ , explained Val@@ er@@ o .
He added that it was &apos; entirely possible &apos; that Franc@@ is requests for car@@ din@@ als .
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new .
Val@@ er@@ o pointed out that the po@@ pes typically raised b@@ ish@@ ops representing vast communities as Car@@ din@@ al , but that Franc@@ is was “ full of sur@@ prises – so we don ’ t know who will name them . ”
GM rec@@ alls some of its new p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps in the United States to repair the seats dossier
General Mo@@ tors C@@ o rec@@ alls almost 19 000 of his new@@ est Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ l@@ t Sil@@ ver@@ ado and G@@ M@@ C 2014 , in order to deal with a problem with inc@@ re@@ mental files , according to a statement on Friday of the American body responsible for the regulation of vehicle safety .
O@@ ut of some p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps , the seats before they were able to present a defec@@ t at the level of the inc@@ lin@@ ation mechanism .
As a result , the dossiers do not comply with the federal safety standards for vehicles with regard to the type of support .
‘ If the vehicle is cu@@ red by the back , it may not protect passengers properly , thereby increasing the risk of injuries ’ , according to the statement displayed at the National High@@ way Tra@@ ffic Safety Administration ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) site .
The models that were recalled were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of G@@ M p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its collapse and restructuring in 2009 .
GM has informed owners of p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps of default in the first half of October .
The N@@ H@@ T@@ SA has not been able to examine the letter of information to owners due to the 16 days of government activities , which has slow@@ ed down the growth in car sales in October .
Sal@@ es of p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and Sierra , which have been re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , have increased by around 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , declared GM on Friday .
In October , GM sold 42 6@@ 60 pic@@ kers and 16 50@@ 3 p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps .
G@@ M ’ s stock price rose by 1.@@ 4 % to $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change on Friday afternoon .
A worker dies in concrete blocks .
A construction worker is dead under dozens of concrete blocks , on Thursday l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The tragedy occurred at 11 a.m. on the streets of Mar@@ qu@@ et@@ te , very close to the inter@@ section of the Be@@ au@@ au@@ t street , in the r@@ ound@@ about of Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La Patri@@ e .
In all probability , work on the foundations has been going on there for some time .
A j@@ uni@@ or wall wall was erec@@ ted in the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had just arrived on the building site in order to recover its tools .
I was travelling by car and I saw the wall collapse with a big smoke cl@@ oud , said Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who is still close to the building site .
I am lan@@ ded and I went to remove the b@@ ric@@ ks that were going back .
We only saw some of his back , that is so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in the fif@@ ties who worked for a co@@ ff@@ ers company .
Re@@ li@@ gious man@@ eu@@ vers have been tried by the emergency services , but they have not been successful .
The man did not survive his serious injuries .
A Commission inspec@@ tor on health and safety at work was sent to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .

In@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism does not excuse the difficulties of the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are site , nor the attacks on d@@ ron@@ es .
The memory of Obama ’ s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened .
N@@ a@@ the@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is a 2@@ n@@ d year student student of the Har@@ v@@ ard Med@@ ical Medic@@ ines Fac@@ ul@@ ty .
I am reading a p@@ ound which is pain@@ fully sad in the last few days .
It is a book which , I thought , would encourage me during the morality of the 2@@ n@@ d year of medicine and would give me hope .
He is called “ The Au@@ d@@ aci@@ ty to W@@ in , ” and this is the m@@ emo@@ irs of Barack Obama ’ s presidential campaign of 2008 .
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I saw myself , this book took me back to the time when the policies were inspired by the millions of people and where speeches could b@@ ite you b@@ reath .
The election ended with overwhelming victory , and presen@@ ters of news newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des have ple@@ aded with joy and my parents have kept all the newspapers they found .
A young team of vision@@ aries was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama ’ s transition period before taking office in 2008 , he had 82 % of his views .
Then I close the book .
The return to the present is a difficult aw@@ ak@@ ening . It is like getting out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these optimistic days , they are as distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change really took place in the years after I first voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put to the credit of Obama great achievements , from the passing of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act to the departure of Iraq ’ s military , to the end of the “ or seen , and the assassination of Os@@ ama bin Laden . ”
In addition , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But , having repeatedly defended Obama ’ s administration to my pe@@ ers and my colleagues , I can no longer explain .
I am on the brink of political despair .
The Republican ob@@ struction cannot explain the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor the attacks on innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collected data on the privacy of Americans , nor the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers who reveal the mis@@ deeds of the government .
It cannot justify the murder of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , or the avo@@ idance of public funding and the over@@ spending of spending during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the &apos; more aggressive ... since the administration of Ni@@ xon &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the im@@ possibility of design@@ ing a simple website for more than three years after the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I do not know whether that was what I expected .
If , at the age of 18 , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that were before it .
Of course , the electoral function is not predictable , because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance , such as the New@@ ton massacre , influence our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples I have listed here seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what bo@@ thers me most .
I voted again for Obama in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a confused and un@@ refin@@ ed alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined .
I felt that Obama , elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections , would make the promises that have been heard for so long .
Yet , while the fav@@ orable Op@@ en Inde@@ x has plun@@ ged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to come back to 2008 through this book .
I would like to see the many promises that have been made .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses for the benefit of Clinton in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania ’ s Pri@@ is@@ ers .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting , he told his team that they had to go on the right track and remain true to their cause .
“ I want us to get back on our talent , ” he said .
We must remember who we are .
We were five years after , Mr President , and I no longer agree with you .
The views expressed in this comment are only those of N@@ a@@ the@@ el Mor@@ ris .
On Friday , at 15@@ .@@ 00 , a violent col@@ lis@@ ion between a motor@@ cycle and a car occurred in F@@ l@@ é@@ on .
The mo@@ late , J@@ on@@ a@@ than , 26 years , of F@@ l@@ é@@ on , did not b@@ other .
Despite rapid relief , he died during this fron@@ tal col@@ lis@@ ion .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims that Mr Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest in relation to the system of parental leave .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire MEP C@@ li@@ ve Pal@@ mer argues that Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his d@@ augh@@ ters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system .
The mining ty@@ co@@ on , which con@@ tests the payment of a $ 6 ( $ 6 ) carbon tax , has argued this in an attempt to remove questions about a possible conflict .
The Pal@@ e United Par@@ ty Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Pal@@ mer said that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s girls were prepared to benefit personally from these policies .
&apos;@@ It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave , because if one of its d@@ augh@@ ters is pregnant , it will have a direct interest in whether or not it gets leave &apos; , Mr Pal@@ mer has said .
Two months after his election , the Elec@@ tion Commission officially declared that Mr Pal@@ mer won the seat of Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast de Fa@@ ir@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes after re@@ count .
Mr Pal@@ mer has put forward the idea of a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of the remains remains to speed up the process .
The d@@ augh@@ ters of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , Brotherhood , and Bri@@ d@@ g@@ et .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over ?
“ We need a better system , ” he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , take your details in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6.@@ 30 p.m. the following morning ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticised the use of paper cra@@ fts to mark the ballot papers .
Is it in order to be able to er@@ ase the result if someone does not agree ?
Today , having a piece of paper seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ tion Commission has studied the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years , has said that his political project includes an international Sun@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he will take on new functions &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service .
He added , &quot; We are not looking for reward , except for the reward for history , because we have to serve the community at a critical moment &apos; , he added .
A team of bi@@ olog@@ ists led by the Wil@@ d@@ life Society of New York identified a new kind of d@@ au@@ ph@@ in to drink off the northern coast of Australia .
Th@@ i@@ b@@ au@@ t Br@@ é@@ li@@ u@@ x , who is responsible for a scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for Conser@@ vation and the E@@ it@@ ality of Anim@@ als and Mic@@ ro-@@ Mar@@ ine ( O@@ EM@@ M@@ M ) , is for Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Is you surprised by the discovery of this new type of d@@ us@@ ph@@ in dol@@ ph@@ in ?
That is good news , but I am not particularly surprised by that .
If in the past , species have been described and identified on the basis of mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ at@@ om@@ ical and geographic basis , the development of new tools , such as gene@@ tics , will enable us to improve our knowledge of species classification .
Moreover , it is not possible for these genetic and m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology to challenge the classification or membership of a species of one kind , a family , or even an order .
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , mor@@ pho@@ ts ran@@ ked animals , based on mor@@ pho@@ logical differences between species .
Today , some of these ran@@ kings are being called into question because of the progress of gene@@ tics .
In the same way , two very close mor@@ pho@@ tic species have been distinguished from gene@@ tics .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
Ten years ago , the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this under@@ family : dol@@ ph@@ ins in the Pacific and wh@@ ales for the Atlantic .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is this an important discovery , as the Wil@@ d@@ life Society Society said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences , in order to protect the species and thus its genetic vari@@ ability .
If this population were already known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only there .
Therefore , if a massive mortality problem caused by a vir@@ al epidemic or acci@@ dental capture arises in the region , we could be dealing with the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than the local disappearance of a population of a larger species on earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered to be threatened or endangered by the number of people on earth , that is to say , the stock , and the possibility that it can recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to the kind of Sou@@ sa horse mac@@ ke@@ rel , whose population of the new species of discovery has come out , its stock has automatically become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ genous , open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This genetic bre@@ w@@ age limits the creation of new species .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , more closed ecosystems favour genetic isolation , which may eventually lead to the creation of new species .
We must be aware that the marine environment is the least well known .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts to M@@ ars , than to know what is going on in the sea of the Mari@@ ann@@ es , only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea .
More money is spent on the search for life on other plan@@ ets than on marine research , and it is high time that this changed .
R@@ ail on the foreign-@@ exchange market
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland has suspended two tra@@ pp@@ ers of its exchange market division according to two sources close to the file , showing once again that the regulators ’ global investigation into suspic@@ ions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , particularly U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank , and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world ’ s most important financial market investigations , where US $ 5.@@ 3 trillion is changing hand in hand .
Both traders are the first R@@ B@@ S employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation , which reflects the scandal of the inter@@ bank rate manipulation .
The bank , which refused to comment on suspen@@ sions , this month confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulators .
&apos;@@ The ongoing investigation on this matter and we cooperate fully with the F@@ A and the other regulators &apos; , said a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the dossier stated that R@@ B@@ S had transmitted em@@ ail@@ s and in@@ stan@@ tane@@ ous messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , to the British regulator , the Financial Con@@ du@@ t Authority .
This tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sha@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 and would have been suspended from the post of European cash trading office J@@ P@@ Morgan .
Ro@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , European cash trading responsible in C@@ iti , has been f@@ leave this week , while B@@ at Gar@@ d@@ in@@ er , the senior currency tra@@ der in Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S , has been suspended by Stand@@ ard Char@@ ty this week .
None of these traders have been charged with any charges .
Mr U@@ sha@@ er &apos;s case included in@@ stant messages sent to and by bankers working in Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ ti@@ group , added sources close to the dossier .
U@@ B@@ S explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , said that he was investigating suspic@@ ions of currency manipulation in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities – the European Commission , the Swiss , the Swiss Competition Authority W@@ k@@ o , the United States Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – look at the allegations of bankers who would have agreed to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market . .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ Morgan and Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators , have indicated sources close to the dossier .
The banks are pl@@ agu@@ ing the in@@ stant messages and em@@ ail@@ s that have been sent for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
The news about these investigations has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment banks in recent years , but which has been called into question this year because of the low volatility of the currencies that limit opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers have tried to play down the matter by saying that it is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast liquid exchange market , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A senior tra@@ der said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms &apos; explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market . L@@ it@@ tle is the cost . &apos;
The news came on the very day that C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it , C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland , announced that he had sent a tra@@ der to his office in the London Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change this week after the loss of $ 6 at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators .
‘ We are convinced that the tra@@ der has acted alone and that the case has been brought under control ’ , a representative of C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ is Switzerland .
The investigation into May@@ or Ro@@ b Ford has been bot@@ ched and supports a lawyer .
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video showing Ro@@ b Ford f@@ lowing from cr@@ ick , M@@ e C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by supported no &quot; as bot@@ ched &quot; investigation .
M@@ e Ru@@ by said that the police had &quot; ignored or played down &quot; elements of evidence against the may@@ or .
On Thursday , the police arrested Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s occa@@ sional friend and driver , Alexander Lis@@ i , 35 years old , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion on the video .
Alexander Lis@@ i , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police have said that they have also observed this man who issued par@@ c@@ els at Ro@@ b Ford , that there are new court documents .
Ru@@ by has called the &apos; in@@ explic@@ able &apos; the fact that the police have never sear@@ ched Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s vehicle or his home , or are listening to his phone , arguing that the police chief Bill Blair has chosen not to act against the may@@ or .
According to the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands , could well have inter@@ cep@@ ted Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s vehicle , stopped the may@@ or , and carried out a ra@@ id - even without a mandate .
It could also have required an in@@ stant ra@@ id , if deemed necessary .
The police chief has not commented , but his spokes@@ person , Mar@@ k P@@ u@@ gas , has described the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by as &apos; obvious and hope@@ less attempt &apos; to be made to the media in a case that does not affect him in any way .
At the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &apos; reasonable motives &apos; which could lead to a criminal charge against the may@@ or .
European Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change in the middle of the sitting except London
With the exception of London , Europe ’ s major stock markets are falling on Friday to mid-@@ sitting , pl@@ agu@@ ed by some disappointing new societies , while Wall@@ -@@ Street is expected to rise .
Moreover , investors remain cautious , because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could un@@ ra@@ vel its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , following the announcement of an inflation rate of 0.7 % for the euro area as a whole , the idea is spreading among the market players that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street fores@@ ha@@ d@@ ows an increase in US action , following two con@@ spic@@ uous re@@ tren@@ ch@@ ment .
To the values , Rena@@ ult ( -@@ 4.@@ 63 % ) recorded the largest withdrawal of CA@@ C 40 , be@@ mo@@ an@@ ed by the outcome of its N@@ iss@@ an partner Friday partner .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) marks Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 ’ s worst performance , having also published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a “ bad bank ” structure ( “ bad bank ” ) , bringing together $ 38 billion of the most ris@@ k@@ ier asset books . They are .
For its part , V@@ od@@ af@@ one ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) remains at the top of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 increases in response to press reports that A@@ T is studying a possible takeover bid .
On the foreign exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the ECB &apos;s monetary policy is going well , as John Har@@ dy , a strate@@ g@@ ist at Sa@@ x@@ o Bank , testi@@ fies .
The ECB ’ s unique mandate has always been inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reason to act at next week ’ s meeting .
We are anticip@@ ating a great potential for a fall in the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing to withdraw from the US currency and affected a lower sitting of two weeks to USD 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 .
In contrast , the eurozone ’ s bond market is supporting the eurozone ’ s bond market .
Obama ’ s Health Reform Act
A great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court said today that Obama ’ s health-care reform law was constitutional .
By 5 votes to 4 , judges valid@@ ated the individual mandate of the P@@ ati@@ ent Protection and Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act – which requires citizens to sign up to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they would have to pay a fine – and said that they were . Constitutional power on the basis of the government ’ s power of taxation .
The President of the Supreme Court , John Rob@@ er@@ ts , has joined the four most liberal members of the Court , while the S@@ ca@@ lia , Thomas , A@@ li@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy judges have expressed disagreement .
The Court also valid@@ ated the other sections of the 2 700 pages and also considered that the provision of the law on the reform of the health system , which states that the eligibility threshold should be low@@ ered to Medic@@ aid , or that it will lose all the federal funding of the programme , was coer@@ cive in accordance with the A constitution .
The procedure to block the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
All the leading Republican candidates in the presidential election in the course of 2012 , including Commission@@ er-@@ designate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , vehe@@ men@@ tly opposed the law .
Rem@@ emb@@ ering the former combat@@ ants in Men@@ on
At the heart of the T@@ ra@@ bu@@ qu@@ et gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ard , civil , religious and military authorities , as well as many patri@@ otic associations , made a tribute , this Friday afternoon , to the soldiers and the dead of all wars .
Mr May@@ or , May@@ or Jean-@@ Claude Gu@@ i@@ bal and various person@@ alities have tabled ger@@ bes in two of the three military square areas of the c@@ eme@@ tery .
Ac@@ ting between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers were injured on Thursday 31 October 2013 in the evening in a violent way on the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip has ceased to operate on Friday 1 November after the deple@@ tion of its fuel stocks , has announced the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve authority .
A local comm@@ ander of the Al@@ zz@@ e@@ di@@ ine al-@@ Q@@ assa@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ades , K@@ hal@@ ed Abu B@@ ak@@ r , and another framework of the armed branch of Hamas , R@@ abi@@ e@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a fir@@ ing of sh@@ ell sh@@ ell@@ s during an incur@@ sion by the Israeli army into the In the south of the Gaza Strip , in the south of the Gaza Strip , according to local medical sources , it is in the south of the Gaza Strip .
Two other local officials in the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ assa@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ ass@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ ou@@ d died when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four combat@@ ants were driving a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
an attack on a tunnel mel@@ ting by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli t@@ ank and a bl@@ unt bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er made an incur@@ sion by one hundred metres within the territory and then withdrawn .
The conflict has lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , a Hamas spokesman , Sam@@ i Abu Z@@ ou@@ h@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &apos; her@@ oes &apos; and said that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of Al@@ -@@ Q@@ assa@@ m who have fallen behind the territory during an incur@@ sion by Z@@ ion@@ ist occup@@ i@@ ers to K@@ han Y@@ ou@@ f .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;@@ Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &apos; , threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army has indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dig@@ ging into Israeli territory from the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , discovered on 7 October , aimed , according to the army , to &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed the use of tun@@ n@@ els to fight against Israel , stating that the aim was to abduc@@ t Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communi@@ qu@@ é .
During the operation , Hamas unle@@ ashed an explosive attack on the forces of the Ta@@ o@@ h@@ al ( the Israeli army ) and injured five soldiers .
Israel in northern Syria
&apos;@@ This mission was imperative due to the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians &apos; , as also indicated by the army spokesman Peter L@@ er@@ ner .
On the other hand , Israel struck an air base in north-@@ west Syria , aimed at a ship@@ ment of missiles for the Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement Hezbollah , reported the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite station on Thursday 31 October .
An American official has confirmed an &apos; Israeli strike &apos; but has not given details of the target .
&apos;@@ In the past , the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah &apos; , and it has been added .
Those responsible for the Israeli Government refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
“ Ex@@ cep@@ tional sources ” that she has not named , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that “ the bombing has targeted a ship@@ ment of solar missiles that were intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon , ” with reference to the powerful Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement that is fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .
Ear@@ lier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights , reported several explo@@ sions that were heard on Wednesday in an air defence base in S@@ on@@ ar J@@ ab@@ é , near L@@ att@@ on , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explo@@ sions .
On the black and white , Mari@@ e Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , who is present to Dan@@ se Dan@@ se , his two new groups of groups : the first inspired by Hen@@ ri Mic@@ ha@@ x &apos;s po@@ les and po@@ ems , the second in@@ vigor@@ ated by the famous so@@ lo@@ s of pi@@ ano G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ operated . Let us look at it from the S &amp; D .
This is an evening that can see the whole of Ch@@ oun@@ ard ’ s pr@@ ism , art , and black bo@@ y .
A white scre@@ en is used as a wall of substance .
On the car@@ pet , however white , in the vast area of the The@@ at@@ li@@ bel@@ vi@@ e , is advanced and profile , an end as a line and d@@ row@@ ned on black , a body .
On the scre@@ en , a Hen@@ ri Mic@@ ha@@ le ink is being planned .
The simple form of the body is taking shape .
And this form will be the whole thing : a ma@@ m@@ mo@@ th physical im@@ itation of design@@ s .
The d@@ augh@@ ters , who are in black and white , only have their hands and face face , waiting on every side of the game , hur@@ ting when the next grap@@ h appears , inc@@ ar@@ n@@ ingly , comes out .
The black and white game of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ ha@@ u is being played by so@@ lo@@ s , in a group in un@@ ison ( a large mass ) , in a large group of 12 so@@ lo@@ s , where each ex@@ ec@@ utes his sign .
We are thinking of the morning &apos; morning &apos; , where , in sol@@ o , Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard carried out a series of written tasks in car@@ t@@ els , which were set out in the front line .
This is the same principle , the P@@ ow@@ er@@ Po@@ int version .
Here , music is strong , per@@ ish , and power stations .
Energy is high , the fast pace .
There will be a reduction in when Car@@ ol Pri@@ or will take refuge under the d@@ ance car@@ pet , to give up , micro@@ - in hand , without so@@ bri@@ ety or restraint , a share of the po@@ em of Mic@@ ha@@ ha@@ le , mon@@ oc@@ de and mon@@ ot@@ one in the sh@@ ou@@ ting , and will go on d@@ an@@ cing .
And there is the music to go back , and the sequ@@ ence to resume .
This is a long and energe@@ tic discharge , if it is possible , and ends up har@@ n@@ essing and eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ing .
Like the regul@@ arity of the visual r@@ hy@@ th@@ m , too .
There are some nice fl@@ ash@@ points - the creation of images has always been a force in Ch@@ oun@@ in@@ ard - as ha@@ ir@@ -@@ spl@@ itting ha@@ ir or black tissu@@ e that is leng@@ th@@ ening the lines .
But the h@@ orm@@ one approach is lacking in composition .
We have the impression that , instead of going to the Mic@@ hel@@ le work meeting , the ch@@ or@@ ac@@ he has imposed itself , with its te@@ eth .
The result is that the bodies seem to be looking at the draw@@ ings .
The co@@ c@@ ks of Mic@@ ha@@ u , like forms of G@@ es@@ tal@@ t , are opening up a broader and gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic fant@@ asy than d@@ an@@ cing , more por@@ ous .
Only the end , in negative , with its d@@ an@@ cing d@@ augh@@ ters m@@ inc@@ ed by a p@@ ob@@ o@@ op@@ ic light and white signs in a black theat@@ re , touches the magic .
The public loved , the reception was warm .
The G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ opa@@ e@@ es , after the en@@ act , are richer .
The scene is part of some grey , d@@ an@@ cing , and pi@@ ano is covered by tissu@@ e , like fur@@ nit@@ ure in a neglected house .
In the pi@@ ano , d@@ wel@@ lers relied to play the game .
Their hand@@ outs in music , which are tou@@ ch@@ y , give real frag@@ ility .
On the scene , couples , in lo@@ f@@ ty du@@ es , are very sen@@ sel@@ ess , even ero@@ ded .
A group of people , small so@@ lo@@ s of transi@@ tions , ho@@ o@@ ks who move , cho@@ ir , a writ@@ er is less bin@@ ary .
Bu@@ ff@@ o@@ ons are appearing , so familiar from Ch@@ oun@@ ard , wearing red no@@ ses , in lo@@ f@@ ty male par@@ ades .
The am@@ ours are car@@ n@@ as@@ ers , fu@@ n or players .
Gra@@ du@@ al , la@@ ugh@@ ter , and little cri@@ es about the ar@@ cha@@ ic , gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ breaking par@@ don , and lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous bodies that are based .
But the room takes flight after sal@@ vation .
A c@@ lown is on the stage when the public leaves .
In this case , everything becomes permitted : the fourth wall falls , the world explo@@ its are super@@ vised , the cab@@ in d@@ augh@@ ters , the spec@@ t@@ ators , are g@@ los@@ sing up , smoking , by@@ passing , and playing codes of applause , d@@ row@@ ning the sa@@ u@@ ce into a mess that has been app@@ all@@ ingly calculated . It is still sen@@ sel@@ ess .
Jo@@ y and mad@@ ness trans@@ c@@ end , and it is the art of Ch@@ oun@@ ard , there to contamin@@ ate the public .
Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g and Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i are being prosecuted for Nor@@ l patents
The group that own@@ s thousands of former Nor@@ tel patents has begun an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of legal proceedings on patents on mobile phones on Thursday , including Google , the company that it has set to the po@@ le when the patent has been auc@@ tioned after the bankruptcy of the Nor@@ tel . .
Ro@@ ck@@ st@@ ar , the cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um that acquired the Nor@@ tel for 4@@ .5 M@@ d , f@@ iled a complaint against Sam@@ sun@@ g Elec@@ tr@@ ics C@@ o L@@ t@@ d , H@@ T@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and four other companies for patent infringement before the court of sitting The United States in T@@ ex@@ as .
Ro@@ k@@ st@@ ar is held jointly by Ap@@ ple , Micro@@ soft , Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , E@@ ric@@ sson , and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of violating seven patents .
Pat@@ ents contain technologies that make it possible to adver@@ tise the Internet ’ s terms of research , have indicated the outcome of the trial , which is Google ’ s core job .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ k@@ st@@ ar .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and H@@ T@@ C make tele@@ phones operating under Google ’ s An@@ dro@@ id exploitation system , which produces fierce competition for Ap@@ ple ’ s mobile products and Micro@@ soft .
In 2011 , Google made an initial $ 900 bid for Nor@@ tel patents .
Google has increased its offer several times , finally proposing $ 4.@@ 4 M@@ ade .

Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion of a house in G@@ es@@ ves : a defec@@ tive water driver at the root of the explosion
The grand@@ mother would have turned a cigarette into a gas le@@ ak .
The explosion of a housing in G@@ es@@ ves , which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning , a 52 year-old grand@@ mother and his 5 year-old grand@@ son , is due to a gas le@@ ak from a defec@@ tive water he@@ at@@ er , indicated on Friday evening the replacement of the King &apos;s prosecutor .
The expert who was sent on the spot by the Public Prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely acci@@ dental .
The grand@@ mother swit@@ ched a cigarette when there was a gas le@@ ak and an accumulation of gas .
The vital prog@@ no@@ sis of the two victims is still committed .
The grand@@ mother was planned by the explosion and has been bur@@ ned down .
The little bo@@ y , who was in his grand@@ father and his compan@@ ion , was on his side and was bur@@ ned more slightly .
&apos;@@ The two victims were in@@ tu@@ b@@ ited and at length condi@@ tioned on the ground before being taken over to Li@@ è@@ ge , she was in hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , in am@@ bul@@ ance &apos; , made the execu@@ tion@@ er José Paul@@ and , des@@ cen@@ ding on the scene .
The grand@@ father , the grand@@ father was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
He and the other side of the House have been able to return to the ground from the ground which remained intact , while the re@@ ar wall in the house was completely destroyed .
The grand@@ father and the ten@@ ant of the neighbouring house , which was weakened by the explosion , were rela@@ xed by the President of the S@@ P@@ A@@ C .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ades in An@@ ne and N@@ am@@ ur and the police of the Ar@@ ches have intervened .
The civil protection of Ca@@ thol@@ ics has stabil@@ ised both buildings .
Egypt calls on the first freely elected president to be o@@ ath .
Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si s@@ wor@@ e the inaug@@ ur@@ ation , but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of the political conflict in Egypt .
The Islamist Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si promised the emergence of a “ new Egypt ” when he l@@ ent the office of inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture to the presidency , becoming the first freely elected president and successor in H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier .
During his inaug@@ ur@@ ation in the High Constitutional Court , Mr Mor@@ si also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the mon@@ archy ’ s over@@ throw of the mon@@ archy 60 years ago .
He was o@@ ath to the Court ’ s 18 black judges , whose building on the border of the N@@ ile was built to look like an Egyptian temp@@ le .
&apos;@@ We aspire to a better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public &apos; , said President Mor@@ si during the sole@@ mn ceremony on public television .
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” explained Mr Mor@@ si , a 60 year-old engine@@ er trained in the US , from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his formation as an illegal and hard-@@ pressed organization . S@@ ucc@@ essive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and police officers kept the building when Mr Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11 hours , the local hour , followed by a small con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred f@@ ans gathered before the Court to acc@@ laim the new president , and , out of the Mubarak ’ s president of the Mubarak years , traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his con@@ voy to go to the very busy streets connec@@ ting the cen@@ ter-@@ town city to the south .
In view of his un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ rescue wheel ” of the Muslim Brotherhood , his personal prestige has strengthened dramatically since his victory and his speech on Friday , in which he tried to port@@ ray himself as the candidate not only of Islamists , but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against the President Mubarak .
“ Egypt today is a civilian , national , constitutional and modern state , ” declared Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , in blue suits and red tie , to be addressed to the judges in the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om room in which he was s@@ wor@@ n .
Lat@@ er , Mor@@ si went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaug@@ ur@@ ation speech .
He was officially gre@@ eted by a military fan@@ fare that played the national an@@ them when he was putting himself in the forefront .
The Mar@@ sh@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ ou@@ i was present at the ceremony .
When he arrived , he was welcomed by the &apos; people and army , hand in hand ... &apos; en@@ gen@@ dered by thousands of people who were assemb@@ led in the great student of university .
F@@ ounded in 19@@ 08 and a previous str@@ on@@ gh@@ old of secular education , the university in Cairo later became a fi@@ ef@@ dom of the Islamist students ’ groups in the 1970 ’ s .
Mr Mor@@ si made a symbolic o@@ ath on Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square , where he left the uprising that ended Mubarak &apos;s authoritarian regime last year , and v@@ owed to recover the presidential powers , whose military council , which replaced the former president , has deprived him of it .
But , by agreeing to send an official o@@ ath to the Court , rather than to Parliament as usual , he bo@@ ils down to the army ’ s will to show that the struggle for power is not over .
Mr Mor@@ si ’ s speech on Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gest@@ ures .
S@@ hu@@ t@@ down in the USA has slow@@ ed down the increase in the car market .
The closure for 16 days of the majority of federal administrations weigh@@ ed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October , showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers , five of the six of which have achieved less than expectations .
The three major De@@ tro@@ it manufacturers are growing at double-@@ dig@@ it levels in October 2012 , but only General Mo@@ tors has done better .
An@@ aly@@ sts anticipated , on average , 15@@ .@@ 4 million sales at an ann@@ u@@ alized rate and corrected for seasonal variations , but the market grew at 15@@ .@@ 3 million according to the estimates of Adam J@@ on@@ as , the analy@@ st of Morgan Stan@@ ley .
In a note to the bank &apos;s clients , it considers that this slight bra@@ ke is primarily due to the &apos; government sh@@ ut@@ down &apos; and its impact on the feeling of the consumer in the first half of the month .
GM has , however , made an increase of almost 16 % of its sales last month to 2@@ 26 40@@ 2 vehicles , compared to 2@@ 11 5@@ 63 expected by the consensus .
The group ’ s four bran@@ ds saw their trade performance improve relative to October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit , among other things , from the success of its p@@ ick@@ -@@ ups , has seen its sales increase by 14 % over a year to 19@@ 1 9@@ 85 vehicles , while the consensus expected 19@@ 4 30@@ 1 .
For its part , Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ler , controlled by Fi@@ at , announced an 11 % increase in its sales to 140 0@@ 83 vehicles , compared to 14@@ 3 5@@ 36 expected .

Greece : Two dead in a sho@@ oting near a neo-@@ Nazi local party .
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday evening by fir@@ ing sho@@ ts by two people who were on board a motor@@ ist who was in front of a local party of the Ne@@ on@@ az@@ i D@@ aw@@ n in the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Athens .
The police were not at present in a position to provide information about the identity of the victims and their possible political aff@@ i@@ lia@@ tions .

Do you think that travel agencies belong to the past as a result of the Internet ?
F@@ resh the Centre seems to be rever@@ sing the trend .
Society has increased its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results thanks to the ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying benefit of the $ 3@@ 25 , $ 3@@ 40 , $ 3@@ 40 pre-@@ tax exercise , against a previous $ 30@@ 5 to $ 3@@ 15 .
If current forecasts are met , it will account for 12 to 17 % of growth compared to the record of $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 M in 2011 .
The Director-General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ light Centre had made 8 % of its profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly as regards travel other than business tri@@ ps in Australia and the United Kingdom .
&apos;@@ Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are well on the way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before interest and tax is deduc@@ ted &apos; , he said .
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits .
In Australia , the rec@@ re@@ ation sector re@@ kin@@ d@@ led in the second half of the year , thereby compens@@ ating for a ligh@@ t-@@ touch home market market .
Similarly in the United Kingdom , the F@@ light C@@ enter Centre has achieved good results , while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States has recovered its losses in the first half of the year , where seasonal demand is lower and should derive benefit from the entire exercise for the third con@@ secu@@ tive time .
The F@@ light Centre ’ s actions increased by 3 c@@ ents to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .

In English literature courses , pupils will have to study at least one part of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic po@@ em and a contemporary British fic@@ tion of fic@@ tion of 19@@ 14 .
The review will also present ‘ new texts ’ to encourage a more diverse reading .
A course that comb@@ ines English with English will be abolished .
From 2015 , pupils will have to switch to an independent G@@ C@@ A , and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education must publish its new programmes of English and me@@ a@@ hs tomorrow – the first areas to be subjected to radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , O@@ f@@ ter , the regulatory burea@@ u , will un@@ ve@@ il a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of the C@@ CS structure , with a new system of rating and lower prices .
Speaking during the summer , Mic@@ hael Go@@ ve , Minister for Education , said that there was a “ broad consensus on the need to reform our system of exam@@ inations to restore public confidence , ” insisting that C@@ CS would be “ more stimul@@ ative , more ambitious , and more rigorous . ” .
Stu@@ dies show that in English schools less time is spent ( 1@@ 16 hours a year , or 3 hours a week in the school year ) than most other countries .
By contrast , Australia ’ s schools offer , on average , 14@@ 3 hours per year , and Singapore ’ s students make around 13@@ 8 hours .
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to me@@ a@@ th@@ s , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the G@@ C@@ ES@@ C ’ s deeper G@@ C@@ SE – as well as the greater importance given to the materials in international ran@@ kings – would likely encourage schools to make more of them .

It works in the mu@@ d , in the jung@@ le and in rivers to offer free medical assistance .
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es Bra@@ w@@ le provides free health care in Cam@@ ero@@ on villages .
Dr B@@ w@@ le and his team spend almost all their weekend on hundreds of patients .
There are not many doctors in this West African country , only 1 for 5 000 inhabitants .
Vo@@ te here or through your mobile apparatus
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le is one of the 10 H@@ é@@ os C@@ N@@ N of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the 10 other her@@ oes , to elect him &apos; H@@ é@@ os C@@ N@@ N of the year &apos; .
This person will receive $ 25@@ 0@@ ,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le looked at his sick father , alter@@ n@@ ating awareness and reck@@ lessness , and travelling to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James B@@ w@@ le was injured in a car accident in 198@@ 1 near Y@@ a@@ ound@@ é , the capital of Cam@@ ero@@ on .
At the beginning , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted an infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of which he was going to carry the rest of his life .
&apos;@@ There was no neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on in Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos; , said Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le .
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money .
Instead , Dr B@@ wa@@ le spent years supporting his father in clin@@ ics and crow@@ ded hospitals , so that he could obtain any treatment he could have .
“ It is not easy , ” adding Mr B@@ w@@ le .
You can leave the house at 5 p.m. , go to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they are waiting for too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr B@@ w@@ le &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there are only one doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
Even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ on would not be able to pay for the consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of the country ’ s health spending is carried out in the private sector .
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” he explained Dr B@@ w@@ le .
And because of poverty , they cannot take advantage of life .
After having seen his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ riots suffering , Dr B@@ w@@ le was determined to try to change the course .
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ le and his voluntary team practic@@ ed more than 700 sur@@ gical acts in the course of the last year .
He became a doctor himself , working as a v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar sur@@ ge@@ on at the central hospital in Y@@ a@@ ound@@ é .
And he created a non-@@ profit humanitarian association , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ M@@ E , which goes to rural areas at week@@ ends to provide free health care .
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32 000 people .
Almost every Friday , with 30 people , they p@@ our into fo@@ d@@ der after having laid down medical equipment on the ro@@ of and going through difficult areas to travel to the villages most in need of help .
This is not always the case .
They have often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or wind@@ ows .
But when they arrive , they are received as her@@ oes : the community is holding a f@@ es@@ ti@@ val , s@@ inging and d@@ an@@ cing , and offering them the best housing available .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and Dr B@@ w@@ le – with his great s@@ mile and his s@@ mile – is more than happy to join the cele@@ bra@@ tions .
The next morning , the team is beginning to receive hundreds of patients .
&apos;@@ We get 500 people on every visit &apos; , Mr B@@ w@@ le said .
They sometimes live at 60 km of the village , and they are on foot .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is being provided .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive cru@@ t@@ ches , a pair of gl@@ asses collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
T@@ on@@ ight , the practical team of simple sur@@ gical acts in local an@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
The operations are usually carried out in a school , a ma@@ id@@ en or a house ; after intervention , the patient stands up and travel@@ s to the re@@ aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the light of the elec@@ tro@@ gen group , the operation room and the ster@@ ili@@ zation of the equipment , Dr B@@ wa@@ le and his volunteers work until the first hours of the Sunday morning .
This is an e@@ ye@@ -@@ open@@ er , but the villages of the villages generally help the team to remain motivated .
‘ They are kno@@ cking on dr@@ ums all night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work ’ , Mr B@@ w@@ le .
On Sunday the team returned , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , made up of doctors and medical students , carried out 700 of the sur@@ gical acts free of charge last year , and knows that their presence can make a difference to those who help them .
A man explained that the free operation he had had to treat a her@@ nia would allow him to work again .
‘ This will change my future and that of my family ’ , has declared man .
In addition to having this travelling hospital and working as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , Dr B@@ w@@ le is also working the night in private sur@@ ger@@ ies around Y@@ a@@ ound@@ é .
It is this second job , he is explaining , which is funding 60 % of his or her association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
“ I don ’ t know when he is sle@@ eping , ” the second year of the second year of D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a , Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a .
He is still in the hospital or is trying to find money for his association in order to be able to carry out these campaigns .
For medical students and nur@@ sing students like the United States and the United States , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr B@@ w@@ le in his missions , it is an opportunity for learning on the ground that they do not have at home .
&quot; We were able to take part in operations to help the blood of the blood or to pass the instruments to D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ le , &quot; explained M@@ iss O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
It is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine second year .
Volun@@ tary students generally pay their journey to Cam@@ ero@@ on and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
But , once in Y@@ a@@ ound@@ é , his pension , transport , and education are borne by Do@@ c@@ tor B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
&apos;@@ He is a her@@ o , there is no doubt &apos; , he said , K@@ a@@ is O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the people of Cam@@ ero@@ on is not close to extinc@@ tion .
For Dr B@@ w@@ le , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ ping others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him a great deal of joy .
&apos;@@ I am so happy when I do this work &apos; , added Mr B@@ w@@ le .
I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
To make people lau@@ gh and alleviate the pain are the reasons why I have to do that .

The two France of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a
As a result , aca@@ demics have long strugg@@ led to define and place Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a .
Professor in the amp@@ theat@@ res and the cl@@ ass@@ rooms ?
Un@@ doub@@ tedly , but by empha@@ si@@ zing his poor travel on the roads , S@@ ci@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , the E@@ ut@@ des High@@ ers .
Ar@@ ound the works of others in his office in the G@@ ast@@ ton@@ -@@ G@@ alli@@ mar@@ d street ?
In fact , but by ignoring the hidden work of the publ@@ ish@@ er of the publ@@ ish@@ er .
In the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , who was occupying the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t cannot be a substitute for real ho@@ ly oil , that of the theory , that has happened .
They were happy to admit to him a great wa@@ ver , anim@@ ator and uni@@ fying of their work , but by pointing out that he was unwilling to produce it himself .
To this uncertain picture , the monu@@ ment of the &apos; Li@@ ves of Rem@@ emb@@ r@@ ance &apos; , to which he attached his name , also contributed .
The bad gu@@ ys have been able to see a huge market for chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of the eye and of the er@@ u@@ di@@ tion , but in@@ adver@@ tently dil@@ u@@ ted .
The two works published by Nor@@ a soon two years ago have already established that the one that was to not write had a lot and written written .
The book that is here should bring it to justice once and for all .
Yet again , there is the temptation , once again , of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , intellectual ag@@ ony , and ju@@ bil@@ ation as attached to one issue .
But it is easy to understand that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered in this book , in such a beautiful title , bring the b@@ ann@@ er with one and the same passion : that of dis@@ covering the n@@ our@@ ishment of French identity .
Why these tragic calls to national unity ?
I@@ d@@ enti@@ suffered : that is a matter of concern .
Not long ago , we were collectively invited to give a definition .
But in the pe@@ re@@ mp@@ tory spirit of our then leaders , French identity was an in@@ tim@@ acy .
It was only by deplo@@ ying accidents , and the case , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism obliges , was entrusted to the pre@@ fec@@ ts and sub@@ pre@@ ts , who are authorised interpreters .
The one that Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a is tr@@ um@@ pe@@ ting is quite different .
It does not have to be a des@@ c@@ end@@ ant of e@@ ternal fran@@ ch@@ ise , but it does not want to be defined .
An@@ aly@@ st who is worried about a family str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he w@@ ins in a forest of symbols , arrested each step by an object in the form of a bus , tor@@ mented by irrit@@ ating questions .
Does this mean that it is born of the company itself : why is it that , in a country that has so long been established on its borders , which was once again on its borders , which was formerly the char@@ tered and soli@@ dly entren@@ ched country , these calls for unity are called for ?
They are so pressing , suggested by Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , than to prevent the distur@@ b@@ ance of the dis@@ cor@@ d in French history .
Fran@@ cs and G@@ au@@ laws , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ac@@ s and Bour@@ gu@@ ign@@ ons , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the forces of division here are very old .
And the most emb@@ le@@ matic of these is , of course , the one in two of national history .
From the earthquake to the revolution , the French have two histor@@ ies and they have two nations , a mon@@ arch@@ ic , the other revolutionary .
The second wanted the death of the first , but did not manage to deny it ; in fact , it was anxious to return to the sac@@ ros@@ anc@@ t and all the more vi@@ vi@@ d of unity and indi@@ visibility that it had cut off to the person who was the obvious and powerful embo@@ di@@ ment of it .
And , from this point of view , an inv@@ inci@@ bly bin@@ ary nation , shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , the ad@@ oration and hatred of the revolution .
In order to make the uni@@ qu@@ eness of French identity felt , nothing is worth four steps outside of the H@@ exagger@@ one , so Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a &apos;s st@@ agg@@ er may well be the core of his book .
Because America and France have a revolution , drawn up a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
But the American b@@ ann@@ er only serves better to underline what is of our own .
There , men who left their An@@ ci@@ en R@@ é@@ g@@ ime in England and no longer had to worry about it .
Here , over@@ crow@@ ded men from an ancient indigenous region , and all the more radical .
There is a consensu@@ al revolution when it has s@@ own the drama and j@@ um@@ ped it .
Here , the founding fathers who are always honoured , and here the revolutionary anc@@ estors whose models you are not able to do , and who have been the cen@@ tre@@ piece , have been killed .
This is an institutional con@@ stan@@ cy , a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitutions , as well as errors to be made up and running .
France \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s Mo@@ del France
Yet there was a time when the French thought that they could rec@@ ou@@ p their history ’ s te@@ eth , and defeat the cur@@ se of two .
To this I@@ I@@ I@@ th Republic , the central and creative moment , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a showed a lot of interest and even ten@@ der@@ ness : sal@@ u@@ ting those who then used to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching school@@ children everything that in the former France was going to prepare for modern France and offer them . A unified version of their history .
But this p@@ aci@@ fic identity has had only a time .
This is again in the debate , driven by a new type of immigration , which is threatened by the increase in the use of re@@ sold minorities , which are absor@@ bed in the European area .
The book thus offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ yal of France , and France ’ s cautious ske@@ t@@ ch .
With , as a premium , the portra@@ it of the histor@@ ian , who should reserve some sur@@ prises .
It is discovered that the shir@@ t was a ca@@ p .
The man of multiple cu@@ o@@ si@@ ties looked , slightly obs@@ cu@@ red , around the same idea .
The role of read@@ ers was at the centre of the centre .
And the person who , more than half a century ago , had a subject on the idea of the nation , but escap@@ ed from the initial exercise of the theory , entr@@ u@@ sts us , and k@@ ic@@ ks him , to the idea that he will have done so .
Of course , less reason@@ ed , more broken , and more sub@@ tle form .
But let us not dec@@ eive ourselves , as binding .
Because much more than the figure imposed by the university curricul@@ um , this is the internal necessity of a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &apos; The return is quite complex to manage &apos; .
The journalist , in Be@@ ir@@ ut , on 8 March 1986 , with three members of his &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; team fil@@ ming a demonstration by H@@ iz@@ bollah , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released almost 21 months later , on 27 November 1987 .
Re@@ Treaty since 2008 , in 2004 , took part in the creation of the Association for the Defence of the hostages , which he has been cha@@ iring for several years .
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and to bring their ho@@ sts of hostages before the International Criminal Court .
D@@ extended over 1 000 days , the four hostages in A@@ q@@ m@@ i ( Al@@ -@@ Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) Dan@@ i@@ el L@@ arre@@ be , Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry D@@ ol , Pi@@ er@@ re Le@@ large and Mar@@ c F@@ é@@ re@@ t were released on Tuesday .
After medical exam@@ inations in the military hospital on the V@@ al-@@ -@@ on Wednesday afternoon , they have been able , since then , to return to their families .
And , gradually , try to return to the course of their lives .
&apos;@@ The New Ob@@ ser@@ ver &apos; questioned Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din , 62 , a pen@@ sion@@ er , who has been reti@@ red since 2008 , the Chairman of the World Trade Organisation .
As long ago as the evening of your release , you were on the &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; pl@@ ate@@ au .
What are your memories today of your release ?
In the case of Be@@ ir@@ ut , in particular .
When I was released , I find myself in the co@@ ff@@ in of a car in which I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ que .
It tells me &apos; you are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and tell me that we can still be killed .
We are very exc@@ ited , but very tense as well .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very stra@@ ined .
They are putting us on the edge of a pa@@ vements .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then we come to the site of the Sum@@ mer@@ land ho@@ tel where the press is present .
The French are bringing us to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
It is time for parents , family , friends , press ...
I remember taking a b@@ ath for an hour .
And have din@@ ner in the T@@ -@@ shir@@ t at the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
I also remember a short night discussing with Ro@@ ger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
The tension is still there , because we do not have the means to evac@@ u@@ ate us to L@@ ar@@ n@@ ac@@ a airport in Cyprus .
Ar@@ ound there in hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , you are taking a private plane that brings us back to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ ren@@ z@@ ara , where P@@ as@@ qua is .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
We are moving to Or@@ ly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
That is a bit bl@@ unt .
There is an incredible s@@ wa@@ p .
And there is a lot of media .
When I left , there were three television channels .
I come back and there is full .
The des@@ cent into the air@@ lin@@ er , the re@@ union with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely emotional .
Between the airport and my home , many motor@@ cycles are following our car that R@@ cus@@ h leads .
The mo@@ vers are sho@@ oting up to take photo@@ graph@@ s and following my home where I have to do a bit of the police to prevent some of them from rising .
The media pressure is enormous .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fa@@ ti@@ gue is such that it is difficult to see it .
We are getting out of a hole and we are suddenly in the middle of the media fires .
It is a bit complicated , a bit violent , rather complex to manage .
But the hardest thing has been done .
On the same day , I am at 20@@ .@@ , the next day I am on the television as well .
Then there is a kind of re-@@ adjustment to life , very slowly , for one or two months , which are a little like a holiday .
What has happened to medical exam@@ inations and to the D@@ G@@ SE de@@ bri@@ e@@ fin@@ g ?
I had the first medical control in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The rest was done in the V@@ al-@@ de-@@ working in the days following my return : radi@@ os , all kinds of exam@@ inations and a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that we can count on him , to remind him if need be , that we are not left to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the ho@@ stag@@ e-@@ ta@@ kers .
That was logical .
I did not embarr@@ ass me .
How do you respond today to the release of the four hostages in Ni@@ ger ?
I listen to what is being said .
The debate on them , among other things , is being held .
Some things have anno@@ yed me , others less .
I am trying to play a part between the questions on my past as a hostage and the chair of the Chair of the World Trade Organization , which allows me to put a stop to this , and I think it is much more interesting to deal with it .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Above all , I am fighting with others to recognise the legal status of the hostage .
In my opinion , there is a problem of sem@@ an@@ tics .
We must call hostage hostages to take hostages , which is most often the case , and allow the hostages to have access to justice , to lo@@ dge a complaint and to bring their ho@@ sts of hostages before the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in sympathy , emotion and welcome the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice ?
A court in The Hague is done for that .
Why do we not say to the ho@@ stag@@ e-@@ ta@@ kers &apos; you have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of the war , like those of all the Geneva Conventions , we are going to bring you to justice &apos; ?
It seems to me , however , that it is justified , legitimate and striking in terms of common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and I am shocked .
That is my main fight .
Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Mor@@ si ’ s trial
There is growing anger among Egypt ’ s Islamists .
Two days before the trial of the de@@ posed President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
A mobili@@ zation of the country ’ s first democratically elected president is being mobili@@ zed throughout Egypt .
This is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood activis@@ t .
So far , no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunte@@ er has been able to take a copy of the documents .
This is not a trial , it is a far@@ ce .
President Mor@@ si ’ s trial is a false trial for a pro-@@ Mor@@ si trial , and he is supposed to try S@@ is@@ i , not the opposite .
Mor@@ si must judge S@@ is@@ i for the massacres in R@@ ab@@ a@@ a , the N@@ ah@@ da massacres , and the massacre of the Republican Gu@@ ard .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
There have been clashes in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police have used te@@ ar gas , 60 demonstrators have been arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police officers will be deployed before the Cairo Police A@@ ca@@ de@@ my , where the Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si will be judged .
H@@ ag@@ el blam@@ ing nine American states for violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state has recognised homosexual marriage , &apos; all spouses have a right to an identity card in the Department of Defense and to the benefits that come with &apos; , reminded the Minister in New York in a speech in front of the An@@ ti@@ -@@ D@@ ef@@ am@@ ation League for the fight against anti-Semitism .
&apos;@@ But some Member States refuse to issue these cards to sa@@ me-@@ sex spouses in the National Gu@@ ard &apos;s facilities &apos; , he has denounced , blam@@ ing these states for violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases or access to their shops .
The Secretary of Defense said that he ordered the head of the National Gu@@ ard , General Fr@@ ank Gr@@ ass , to ensure that federal law was implemented .
The n@@ in@@ e-@@ state front began by the T@@ ex@@ as , which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the T@@ ex@@ as National Gu@@ ard , due to a conflict between the text law and the federal law on homosexual marriage .
He was joined in his refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ ppi , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Car@@ ol@@ ine , and Western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defense officer .
The Pen@@ tag@@ on estimates the people affected by the recognition of sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage to around 5@@ 600 people , 17 000 by including the National Gu@@ ard , the reserve and pensioners .
Sixth edi@@ tion of P@@ la@@ ly Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard on Saturday in H@@ y@@ res
The sixth edi@@ tion of P@@ la@@ ly Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard is taking place on Saturday 2 November at the sk@@ ate in H@@ y@@ res .
Organ@@ ized by the B@@ ram@@ p Association of B@@ um@@ p , competition should bring together the best sk@@ tors in the region .
The en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment is taking place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification stages will begin in the process at 10 o &apos;@@ clock before the final date at 3 p.m. and the award of the price at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to ad@@ mire the technical pro@@ w@@ ess of young people who , for some , are already going to the highest competi@@ tions at the highest level , like the young Catholic pro@@ di@@ gi@@ ate L@@ or@@ ren@@ z@@ o P@@ lu@@ umb@@ o .
In just 10 years , he has already taken his place for the European cham@@ pion@@ ships in Copenhagen , and he does not like anything until they go to competitors who exceed three heads .
Tor@@ onto , the may@@ or of Tor@@ onto , has been asking him about drugs on a drug issue .
In Canada , the May@@ or of Tor@@ onto is suspected of d@@ row@@ ning , according to several media .
A video on justice seems to support these suspic@@ ions .
The person concerned , Ro@@ b Ford , has always denied that he has consumed a pen@@ ny , while recognising a pen@@ ch@@ ant for can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
On Thursday , he ou@@ sted several journalists from his property .
We also believe that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment .
There is a case of ra@@ b@@ ies in a c@@ at in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ Estaing .
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of ra@@ b@@ ies had been detected in a s@@ at@@ on of the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ is@@ es , obviously of foreign origin , while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001 .
The ch@@ at@@ ter was found on 25 October in Ar@@ g@@ en@@ eu@@ il and died on 28 October .
The diagnosis of ra@@ b@@ ies was confirmed by the Pa@@ ste@@ ur Institute .
&apos;@@ An epide@@ mi@@ ological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this chair between 8 October and , on 28 October , including , including , the ministries of health and agriculture .
&apos;@@ Five people who have been in contact with the k@@ at@@ on have already been identified &apos; and received preventive treatment .
&apos;@@ Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es man , the preventive treatment of human ra@@ b@@ ies , administered after contact with the animal , but before the symptoms appear , is very effective &apos; , says the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The ministries are now calling for people who would have been killed , gri@@ pped , wi@@ ped out , or d@@ ashed on a m@@ ould or a skin affected by that ch@@ at@@ ter , or whose animal would have been in contact with that ch@@ at@@ ter between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0@@ 8.@@ 11 . 00@@ .@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November .
According to the communi@@ qu@@ é , &apos; France has been free of ra@@ b@@ ies since 2001 , this ch@@ at@@ us or the mother were imported from another country &apos; , not un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the latest &apos; indigenous &apos; ra@@ b@@ ies &apos; case dates back to December 1998 on a fo@@ x and that &apos; France is declared un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed in November 2001 by the International Office for Animal Health ( O@@ I@@ E ) &apos; .
There was a case of ra@@ b@@ ies on an illegally imported Chile from G@@ am@@ bia in 2008 .
&apos;@@ The ra@@ b@@ ies is a deadly disease if it is not dealt with in time &apos; , re@@ minis@@ cent of ministries and it is trans@@ missible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama ’ s Global Health Reform
Under an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday on his unambiguous and often repeated promise that ‘ if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it ’ .
After hundreds of thousands of people have received res@@ titu@@ tion opinions from their providers , the Republic@@ ans have criticised the President in the last few days , acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
“ The vast majority of people with a good health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
Tal@@ king about what he calls “ a current state of affairs ” about the resili@@ ence , President Obama has encouraged the Americans to seek new insurance on the market .
Most people will be able to obtain full and better adapted health systems for the same price , even less so than expected .
“ You will win , ” he said .
The Administration announced that it should not be surprising if the 5 % of the population who themselves contract their insurance were forced to change their regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act .
&apos;@@ Let me address these Americans directly : you deserve better &apos; , said K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ bed in his testi@@ mony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington .
Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who over@@ saw the implementation of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act , indicated that the launch in October of the online market had failed “ la@@ ment@@ ably . ”
&apos;@@ I am as frustrated and irrit@@ ated as anyone &apos; , she added .
I look forward to reg@@ ain@@ ing your confidence .
It is an ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us who gave this sentence , when she believed his micro@@ phone cut , addressing an assist@@ ant behind it at yesterday &apos;s sitting , following a contentious exchange of views with B@@ ill@@ ly L@@ ong , The Republican Party of M@@ iss@@ our@@ i is about whether it should adhere to Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
For more than three hours , B@@ ill@@ ly L@@ ong has repeatedly asked Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us why the &apos; architec@@ t &apos; of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act did not voluntarily re@@ linqu@@ ish insurance sponsored by the government to sign a regime through He@@ al@@ th@@ Car@@ Car@@ .@@ go@@ v than it did . Now it is about millions of Americans .
C@@ ho@@ ice in Abu D@@ hab@@ i
The happy job elected , J@@ ke Vic@@ te Pre@@ ko@@ p , combined the col@@ ours of the car brand and the German flag , while incorporating the no@@ tions of speed and heat in the run@@ way .
S@@ bas@@ ti@@ an V@@ et@@ tel , a For@@ mul@@ a 1 world champion in For@@ mul@@ a 1 , has e@@ ased a special ca@@ p of the Gr@@ and Pri@@ x of Abu D@@ hab@@ i on Friday , whose design was carried out by a Mexican f@@ an of 21 years .
In the context of a competition launched by one of the spons@@ ors , a car brand , a stable , one of 1@@ 500 car@@ to@@ ons from all over the world was chosen .
He was invited to follow the G@@ P of Abu D@@ hab@@ i , with a friend , and can therefore look closely at the German champion , the run@@ way and his s@@ ang .
It was intended to wear this ca@@ ke on Friday and Saturday , to carry out tests .
It is likely that he will have another special ca@@ ke on Sunday , for the race , to mark his 4@@ th con@@ secu@@ tive global title .
A constituent of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ l@@ o launched his Party of the sub@@ ur@@ bs
Let us not dec@@ eive ourselves .
In the spirit of Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , his foun@@ der , the &quot; sub@@ ur@@ bs &quot; Party , is not just directed at the ban@@ li@@ e@@ ards .
I have chosen a French card as a lo@@ go .
When I speak of sub@@ ur@@ bs , I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , his draft , presented to the press conference in his native of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ l@@ o , was born out of the desire to defend multicul@@ tur@@ alism better , this great cultural po@@ t , which is characterised above all by the distric@@ ts .
My proposal No 1 is to set up a minis@@ try for multicul@@ tur@@ alism , he says .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ in , 50 years of territorial att@@ achment , is now claiming to be &quot; 100 % a@@ political &quot; even if he has not always been neutral .
He then , together with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ el@@ i in 2002 , subsequently supported locally Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the equality values I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if the right-wing people are prepared to support me , I will also listen to them .
There are only extremist parties that I am not talking about .
In addition to multicul@@ tur@@ alism , Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine built his programme -@@ consul@@ table on Inter@@ net@@ - from many themes that are supposed to speak to the sub@@ ur@@ bs and especially to young people : the right to vote for foreigners , the leg@@ alisation of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , the civilian majority at 16 years . , the rehabilitation of the function of building the Buil@@ ding Gu@@ ards ...
There is still a need for candidates to form lists and to defend his ideas on the political scene , &apos; .@@ For the 2014 municipal elections , which may be fair , he would recognise &apos; .
It is a problem of time and money .
The party in the sub@@ ur@@ bs should still be represented in Au@@ ber@@ vit@@ a through my candi@@ d@@ acy and I also hope in other cities .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine already has seven heads of list in me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an France and Mart@@ ini@@ que .
&apos;@@ And the support that I have received since yesterday does not come from all sub@@ ur@@ bs &apos; &apos; is welcome .
John Ker@@ ry , unprecedented , admitted that American sp@@ ying “ went too far . ”
John Ker@@ ry has pointed to the United States &apos; defensive attitude towards its surveillance programmes by ad@@ mitting , unprecedented , that on several occasions sp@@ ying has gone too far in the wrong way .
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had , like Barack Obama , ruled on “ automatic pilot ” when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations of the whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lowers Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den on the N@@ SA sp@@ ying activities came into being .
The lea@@ ks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &apos; It is undeniable that the President , myself and other members of the government have taken note of certain things as an automatic pilot because we were able , as early as the Second World War and then to the difficult years of the Cold War , and then well , then well . Of course , September 11 .
He then became the first senior member of the United States Government to admit that American es@@ pion@@ age had over@@ run , but insisted that the rights of everyone had not been violated .
He said : “ In some cases , it has gone too far . ”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to the people that he is now carrying out an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels dec@@ eived .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused as part of this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry has insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : “ We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up . ”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , to blow them up and to attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they act ?
We have indeed prevented aircraft from falling , buildings to explo@@ de and people to be murdered because we have been able to read the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to address the concerns about alleged American sp@@ ying and to convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the US , explained to the president of the Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs on Thursday .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut indicated that he had spoken to the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the feeling of frustration generated by the supervision of the National Security Council . A@@ gen@@ c@@ y .
&apos;@@ It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay alongside us in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism &apos; , said Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first term , and Chairman of the European Senate &apos;s Sub@@ committee on European Senate , during an interview since Washington .
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the N@@ SA programmes .
The press reports that the N@@ SA cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which has damaged relations with some allies in the United States , but the agency &apos;s director said this week that this was not true and that it was a misunderstanding , as it was a question of meta@@ data that NATO allies had collected and Together with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations have reported S@@ now@@ den documents that the N@@ SA had inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 34 other heads of state .
The Director of the Int@@ elli@@ gence Service , James C@@ app@@ er , has justified sp@@ ying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice on both sides .
In this turbul@@ ent atmosphere , Mur@@ ph@@ y indicated that his office was organising a cong@@ ress trip , which should take place this year , and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and the two cham@@ bers .
The names of other participating legislators should be un@@ ve@@ iled in the coming days .
He pointed out that the route remains to be defined .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the aim of this journey was to improve relations , but also to show &apos; affec@@ tion@@ ate firm@@ ness &apos; .
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of es@@ pion@@ age programmes that they have been applying themselves for years .
‘ We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to engage in es@@ pion@@ age ’ , they have said Mur@@ ph@@ y .
In the meantime , Ker@@ ry has planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the resen@@ tment of US strategies in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as the US surveillance activities .
The London Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change closed down on Thursday , pl@@ agu@@ ed by S@@ hell ’ s poor performance and following an announcement by the Fed to keep it in support of the economy , as planned .
An Austr@@ ali@@ an sentence on his prison sentence in Thailand
One 21@@ -@@ year-old Sy@@ d@@ ney , sentenced to 15 days in prison in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et for allegedly alleged to have been assa@@ ul@@ ted by a tax@@ i driver , appe@@ aled for the judgment and was released under b@@ ail .
Ste@@ breathe Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first found guilty by a court of P@@ hu@@ k@@ and P@@ hu@@ k@@ let on 15 June of false declarations after telling the Tha@@ i police that a local tax@@ i driver , accompanied by two other men who ma@@ stered him , attacked him early on Sunday , 10 June . .
However , video surveillance record@@ ings later revealed that she had returned to her ho@@ tel safely after leaving her small Austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
The P@@ hu@@ k@@ et police inter@@ rog@@ ated B@@ am@@ ford for two days before it admitted that it had invented the history of all parts .
It was held in a local command cell prior to the court hearing before the court .
B@@ am@@ ford was sentenced to a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a low-@@ security detention centre on the periphery of P@@ hu@@ k@@ let rather than in a prison for women .
This is the gir@@ l of the Austr@@ ali@@ an League ’ s former player of ru@@ g@@ by Peter Tun@@ ks , who appe@@ aled to the Foreign Ministry of Can@@ ber@@ ra to help his daughter .
Tun@@ ks said in Sy@@ d@@ ney ’ s Sunday Te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h that the entire family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia .
‘ We have , of course , experienced a time of an@@ gu@@ ish , but we hope to bring it back to the home as soon as possible ’ , said Tun@@ ks .
B@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled for the judgment and was released following the payment of a 50 000 ba@@ g .
In Australia , the press has said that , in the meantime , it has been on holiday in the K@@ ra@@ bi region , south of Thailand .
Tha@@ i legal sources have indicated that B@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et , but warned that the call could lead to an increase in sentence of up to two years &apos; imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison .
However , following the recent murder in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et of Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith , an Austr@@ ali@@ an travel ag@@ ony , Thailand could also seek to restore its image to tourists , which could lead to acqu@@ it@@ tal .
The French police will stop the supporters of Ander@@ le@@ ic@@ ht other than the R@@ S@@ C@@ A square .
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the Ro@@ yal S@@ port@@ ing C@@ lu@@ b of Ander@@ le@@ ch@@ t against Paris Sain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ ar@@ t on Tuesday , reported on Mari@@ e Ver@@ be@@ ke , the spokesman for the police area Brussels at mid@@ day on Friday .
The Belgian supporters of the R@@ S@@ C@@ A who want to go to this meeting of the Cha@@ mp@@ ions League will have to make use of the travel system set up by the S@@ C@@ A .
&apos;@@ The bus con@@ voy will be es@@ cor@@ ted by the police from a former border post of Re@@ ke@@ m to the P@@ S@@ G stad@@ ium &apos; , passed on to the spokes@@ person .
