S@@ pec@@ ta@@ k@@ ular j@@ um@@ ps in &quot; W@@ ing@@ follow &quot; above Bo@@ go@@ ta
The sports sport@@ sman J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lor@@ ez j@@ um@@ ped on Thursday of a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter above Bo@@ go@@ ta , the capital of Colombia .
As@@ ked by a w@@ ad@@ er ( a love combination of w@@ ings ) , he spent at 160 km / h above the famous Mon@@ ser@@ ra@@ tis s@@ ine , located more than 3 000 me@@ ters al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ ds had gathered to observe his explo@@ it .
A black box in your car ?
While the pl@@ ann@@ ers of the United States road network have trouble finding the money to repair the motor@@ way infrastructure in dec@@ it@@ ude , many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the board of your car .
The devices , which all record a car car and pass on information to civil servants , are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the government planning offices to re@@ work the obsolete system of financing the main American roads .
The sector generally without planning interest of major a@@ xes suddenly caused a very lively debate and hec@@ tic alliances .
The liber@@ tarian ones have joined environment@@ alist groups to press for the government to use small bo@@ xes to keep track of the mine you &apos;@@ re talking about , and perhaps of the road on which you are circul@@ ating , and then use the information to draft a tax law .
The Te@@ a Party is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liber@@ ty Union is also very concerned and express its concern about the protection of privacy .
And while the members of Congress fail to agree to know if you need to continue , several states di@@ dn &apos;t wait .
They are looking for how , over the next decade , they will be able to move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles travel@@ ing .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of drivers have already bo@@ thered these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with a system of surveillance by G@@ PS , for an experimental defec@@ t .
This is really necessary for our nation .
&quot; It &apos;s not as if we had the choice &quot; , said H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ h@@ ra@@ ta , director general of the Sou@@ ther@@ n California Association Association , which states that the state is starting to record the miles travel@@ ed by each Califor@@ n@@ ian car driver by 20@@ 25 . .
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do it .
The pressure comes from the fact that the High@@ way Tr@@ ust F@@ un@@ d of the country , financed with the taxes that Americans pay for the p@@ ump , is financially dry .
Americans no longer buy as much g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine as before .
C@@ ars can travel more with a gall@@ on with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are re@@ tic@@ ent about increasing the tax , even of 1 % , while the prices of petrol are high .
&quot; The g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not sustainable &quot; , said Le@@ e M@@ un@@ n@@ ich , a transport policy specialist at Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a University .
His state recently inst@@ alled trac@@ ers out of 500 cars to test a mine payment system .
&quot; This turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term , &quot; he said .
W@@ on@@ ks calls it charges for using mil@@ e@@ age .
It &apos;s not surprising that the idea se@@ duc@@ ed by the liberals , since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to help reduce traffic j@@ ams and gas emissions , for example .
California &apos;s pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system because they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the State &apos;s ambitious laws on climate change .
But the representative Bill S@@ us@@ ster ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a ) , president of the Transport Committee of the House of representatives , said that he also saw him as the most viable alternative in the long term .
The supporters of the free market of the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for mine .
&quot; It &apos;s not just a tax is eng@@ ul@@ fed in a big black hole &quot; said A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , the deputy president of the politics at the Re@@ as@@ son Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits that are given to them .
The movement is also supported by two former American secre@@ tar@@ ies in Trans@@ ports who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to go along the path of payment to the mine .
The American Senate approved a pilot project of 90 M $ last year that would have been about 10 000 cars .
But the presidency of the House killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural law@@ makers representative of voters who have to travel from many miles to their work or city .
Several states and large cities nevertheless make progress on their side .
The most specific is O@@ reg@@ on , which has mobili@@ zed 5 000 drivers to carry out the most important experience in the country .
These drivers will soon pay the State for mil@@ e@@ age fees instead of taxes on g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
New York City is considering one .
Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is trying a test on a limited number of tr@@ uc@@ ks .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of America ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) study how she could implement the change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where about 50 voluntary car drivers recently equipped their car with a de@@ vice , drivers were worried that the government could follow their little facts and gesture .
&quot; The concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and this kind of thing are a big problem &quot; , said Al@@ au@@ d@@ din K@@ han , who heads the strategic management of performance in the N@@ ev@@ ada Department department .
It &apos;s not something people want .
From the beginning of the test , the AC@@ L@@ U of N@@ ev@@ ada warned her site : &quot; It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into loc@@ alization devices in its own right . &quot;
There is no need to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be broad@@ ened to maintain the recording of people &apos;s daily bre@@ eds .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find an affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles it takes a car , but without knowing where or the exact time .
If we can do that , added K@@ han , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The search for this technology has led some State agencies to call on a small start-@@ up of California for the name of T@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society did not go to help car drivers who pay taxes to the states .
She was trying to pene@@ tr@@ ate into the emerging market of au@@ to insurance , where drivers would pay according to their mil@@ e@@ age .
But the devices she test have please the pl@@ ann@@ ers of the major a@@ xes because they don &apos;t use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , down@@ loaded perio@@ dic@@ ally by mo@@ de@@ m .
&quot; People will be more pr@@ one to do that if you don &apos;t record speed and don &apos;t loc@@ ate them &quot; , said R@@ y@@ an Mor@@ ris@@ on , Man@@ aging Director of T@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
Bi@@ g mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of certain states .
There are much less expensive means and much less intru@@ sive methods .
In O@@ reg@@ on , the pl@@ ann@@ ers try the experience by offering motor@@ ists different choices .
They can choose a de@@ vice with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have any de@@ vice at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay for a package based on the average number of miles travel@@ ing by all the residents of the State .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing equipment to do more , rather than not enough .
In New York City , transport officials are trying to develop a tax de@@ vice that would also be equipped to pay par@@ king fees , provide &quot; driving payment for driving &quot; and create a set of data on real speed from the other drivers that drivers could use to avoid emb@@ le@@ ms . T@@ ry ill@@ um@@ inating .
&quot; motor@@ ists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them &quot; , indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder if the whole debate about payment to the mine is not just a huge di@@ version .
To the Commission Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an Trans@@ portation of the San Franc@@ is@@ co area , those responsible say that the Congress could very simply manage the High@@ way Tr@@ ust Tr@@ ust Fun@@ d by increasing taxes on petrol .
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hy@@ bri@@ d vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of petrol , so that everyone pays their fair share .
&quot; It &apos;s not necessary to use a radical sur@@ ger@@ y when you simply have aspir@@ in , &quot; said <unk> y R@@ en@@ sch@@ ler , the director of legislation and public affairs with the committee .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bo@@ ie : four me@@ ats in e@@ av@@ es@@ se
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an has not ended up sur@@ taking this year .
From The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , published in January , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a luxury edi@@ tion planned for November 4 , with several me@@ ats .
Four have already emerged on the To@@ le .
The announcement of the appearance of a new al@@ bu@@ m from David Bo@@ ie left everyone out .
The day of his 6@@ 6@@ th birth@@ day on 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ bu@@ m would come out in March .
After 10 years of silence ( the last dis@@ c , Re@@ ali@@ ty , date of 2003 ) and too few cases in public , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an showed that we could still count on him to make the po@@ p scene .
A f@@ es@@ ti@@ n for his f@@ ans
Not tired of sur@@ prises , David Bo@@ ie had more of a turn in his ba@@ g with The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay .
The Th@@ in White has thus planned to re@@ publish this al@@ bu@@ m on November 4 .
For the occasion , he con@@ co@@ c@@ ted a real f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans .
This edi@@ tion , entitled The N@@ ex@@ t Day Ex@@ tr@@ a , will be presented in the form of three dis@@ cs : the original al@@ bu@@ m , novel stu@@ di@@ o sessions and re@@ i@@ x@@ es , as well as a D@@ V@@ D containing the four c@@ lic@@ h@@ es already un@@ ve@@ iled .
The N@@ ex@@ t Day will contain a total of ten additional ti@@ t@@ les compared to the original al@@ bu@@ m : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x@@ e edi@@ tion , five s@@ ong@@ s specially un@@ ve@@ iled for the occasion , as well as two rem@@ n@@ ants .
David Bo@@ ie , moreover , made presen@@ tations of this nice co@@ ff@@ t in a video .
He introduces both records , but also the acc@@ ess@@ ories provided with : exclusive photo@@ s and po@@ ch@@ et@@ tes , a net to share his own im@@ pres@@ sions , a sh@@ it with the words ...
And , above all , he gives a fore@@ taste of his new title . At@@ om@@ ica , typically in The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay &apos;s ve@@ in , with gu@@ ys very much advanced and ro@@ ck electricity so@@ rely under control .
In@@ ed@@ ges already in e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping
But At@@ om@@ ica is not the only title to un@@ ve@@ il his weapons .
The In@@ forming , Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ck@@ et M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O are also available on the web .
The In@@ forming is in double face : an wor@@ ris@@ ome intr@@ in@@ er before a c@@ av@@ al@@ c@@ ade c@@ av@@ al@@ c@@ ade that is slowly slowing down and leaving room for a po@@ p .
On Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ck@@ let M@@ an , did he want to make a little reference to Ro@@ ck@@ let M@@ an &apos;s M@@ an of El@@ ton John , or even to Gr@@ avi@@ ty ?
With this title , the sing@@ er seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth .
S@@ pace O@@ d@@ di@@ ty , on the other hand , was much more serious .
On Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , David Bo@@ ie once again makes reference to his str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold : will he come from another planet ?
Ad@@ ff@@ ers of gu@@ it@@ a , en@@ vo@@ ys who are en@@ cro@@ ached , want to leave the Earth .
In any case , we like to play a bur@@ ge@@ on with these ti@@ t@@ les . These ti@@ t@@ les : turn around inform@@ er , man on board a roc@@ ket , Mar@@ tian potential ...
It conce@@ als and reveals at the same time , plays to adopt different person@@ alities , as he did throughout his career , especially with his charac@@ ters Z@@ i@@ gg@@ y St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ add S@@ ane .
No wonder he has a hand in the photo@@ grap@@ h of the campaign L &apos;@@ In@@ vi@@ itation in the V@@ age , the brand Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , whose new face he embo@@ dies .
He will appear in one of their advertising spo@@ ts , broadcast from 10 November .
The Defense Minister , Ro@@ ch@@ son , insisted that the injured soldiers were not sum@@ mon@@ ed by Canadian armed For@@ ces , and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civil life .
At@@ t@@ acked by liberals and neo-@@ democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr Nichol@@ son assured that before their release , the members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and none of them is released before being ready , he said .
Cri@@ tics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the rule of &quot; the univers@@ ality of the service &quot; of the army demanding that staff be able to carry out a series of varied tasks - to reach the 10@@ -year ad@@ mis@@ sibility period required for the benefits of the army . retirement .
They cited two cases reported by La Pres@@ se Can@@ ad@@ ian , including the one of a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Com@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a reser@@ vis@@ t from London , On@@ tari@@ o , reached post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , has been freed from the army despite its request to stay a year more so that it can receive a fully inde@@ xed pension .
His case came after that of Corpor@@ al G@@ l@@ en Kir@@ ge , who told a parliamentary commission last month that he was pushed toward the exit before being ready because he di@@ dn &apos;t answer the rule of univers@@ ality of service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared to leave , with plans and consultation sessions , but that it was completely different than wanting to leave the ranks .
&quot; I told them that I was not ready &quot; , he said during an interview with La Pres@@ se Canadian Wednesday .
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay , and they said no .
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan , the army is struggling to determine which la@@ titude it can give to w@@ ounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks , but who are not fit to fight .
According to the current rules , the seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
If they don &apos;t meet the criteria for deployment abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons , 19@@ 9 had not reached the service period required for pension benefits .
The liberal spokes@@ person for former combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked for the reintegration of the Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins on Wednesday , while the neo-@@ democratic J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for the immediate end of &quot; this shameful practice . &quot;
Dis@@ ney put on the t@@ ab@@ let to launch an anim@@ ated series
The American media and enter@@ tainment group decided to give priority to t@@ ab@@ lets on its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children .
The first nine episo@@ des of S@@ her@@ i@@ ff is C@@ alli@@ ed s Wil@@ d West will be available from 24 November on the site w@@ at@@ ch@@ Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ j@@ uni@@ or@@ .@@ co@@ m or via its application for tele@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
His global launch on the Dis@@ ney group channels is planned only in 2014 , details the communi@@ qu@@ é of his Dis@@ ney Di@@ vi@@ de division .
The anim@@ ated design , destined for children from 2 to 7 years old , tells the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the Ch@@ it@@ te C@@ alli@@ e , sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of a city in the west American where she makes order with a mag@@ ical l@@ ass@@ o .
Each episo@@ de includes two stories of 11 minutes .
&quot; Inter@@ act with smar@@ t@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &quot; , commented on Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , vice president for digital products with Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , cited in the communi@@ qu@@ é .
This kind of experience is part of Dis@@ ney &apos;s efforts to &quot; expand the life of its series and build new relations with its public thanks to digital platforms that are increasingly important &quot; , added .
A survey published at the beginning of this week by the Commission . S@@ en@@ se Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of less than 2 years old have already served a t@@ ab@@ let or phone , and 72 % less than 8 years old , compared to 10 % and 38 % respectively . Two years ago .
S@@ now@@ den is ready to &quot; cooperation &quot; with Germany on the question of American surveillance .
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lower of American intelligence services , said he was ready to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy before the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director K@@ e@@ ith Alexander were not providing answers on their activities .
The German deputy , Hans@@ -@@ Christian St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met on Thursday Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia , where he benefits from the right of asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter that the deputy presented to the media in Berlin Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &quot; Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a le@@ ak and seeks to pen@@ alize political dis@@ course with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself . &quot;
However , to tell the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he thought the support of the international community could persuade the American government to give up criminal charges against him .
In the context of the complaint lod@@ ged by the American Ministry of Justice , he is accused of sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of state property .
Hans@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich , Minister of the German Interior , said in Z@@ ed@@ it On@@ line : &quot; If Mr S@@ now@@ den is ready to talk to the German officials , we will make it possible . &quot;
relations between the United States and Germany were tested following complaints according to which the N@@ SA had put on the phone phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Thomas O@@ p@@ hot@@ n , the deputy head of the parliamentary group super@@ vised by the foreign secret services , said that if there was a chance to listen to Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness &quot; without putting him in danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States &quot; , it had to be taken advantage of .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a German MEP , has published a pho@@ to of him with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
During his visit to Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr St@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that , according to the lawyer of the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Mr S@@ now@@ den could not go back to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den testi@@ fied in Germany , you should give him the assurance he would be in &quot; security &quot; there , said the deputy .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a &quot; serious and sustained persecution &quot; that forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction to &quot; my act of political expression &quot; .
Citizens all over the world as well as high officials – including in the United States – thought that the re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was of public use .
The letter puts forward a offer of cooperation with the German authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved . &quot;
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able could soon offer inter@@ active TV
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subscri@@ bers could well have access to applications like Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter and ultimate video service on request Net@@ f@@ li@@ x via their television in a future that doesn &apos;t seem that far away .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary indicated Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests in the be@@ ta version of this platform with some of its users .
&quot; This will allow us to value more us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces as well as more options &quot; , explained the president and head of the management of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , Lou@@ is Aud@@ let , in meetings .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er is similar to his competitors , like Bel@@ l , even if the subsidiary of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o does not yet have a precise date regarding this new platform .
&quot; We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail &quot; , pointed out Mr Aud@@ et .
The ultimate goal is still to offer tools to which our clients do not currently have access .
The telec@@ oms giant Ro@@ gers has already indicated that he could offer Net@@ f@@ li@@ x if some technical details , which were not mentioned , could be settled .
In the United States , the popular service service says being in discussions with some major distributors so that its service is available via their distribution platforms .
The P@@ .@@ out@@ .@@ g@@ . de Co@@ ec@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ ast@@ er also welcomed the announcement made by the Har@@ per government during his speech at the Tro@@ r@@ ine on October 16 .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force TV and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay services at the card .
&quot; It &apos;s about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channels of channels , it doesn &apos;t work &quot; , said Mr Aud@@ et .
It hopes , however , that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Council of T@@ elec@@ om and T@@ elec@@ ommunic@@ ations ( CR@@ T@@ C ) will result in interesting recommendations .
&quot; He will have to emerge from these discussions a new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy in relation to television &quot; , said the P@@ .@@ below .@@ g@@ . de Co@@ ec@@ ec@@ o .
The CR@@ T@@ C has held consultations with the public since last week and they should continue with industry next week .
On the results side , Co@@ ec@@ ec@@ o indicated having a net benefit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 <unk> per action .
This is a retro@@ grade step compared to the net benefit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million , or 83 per action , of the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this step backwards with depreci@@ ation costs linked to new acquisition .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o acquired in 2012 the Atlantic B@@ ros@@ land c@@ able , established in the United States , for $ 1.@@ 36 billion .
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the company &apos;s failure .
Last December , show society also bought Pe@@ er Pe@@ er 1 Net@@ works , an Internet provider established in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , for the sum of 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o &apos;s income , they experienced 4@@ 1.5 % growth in the fourth quarter to reach 50@@ 4.@@ 7 million million .
They are 1.@@ 8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able , was 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 hours per action , declining compared to 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million , or 93 <unk> per action , last year last year .
Co@@ g@@ o income , however , grew by 45 % to reach 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 clients in the fourth quarter .
However , for the 2013 financial year , the number of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o clients is rising 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Aud@@ et is not worried about the number of customers changing in this way .
For me , it &apos;s not an indication of a change of trend , he observed .
It varies from one quarter to the other with very high competition .
From horse to beef products .
H@@ ey meat has been found in can@@ ning bo@@ xes of beef products sold by two small British teachers of low-cost distribution , today announced the food hygiene agency .
routine tests revealed that products drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the channels H@@ om@@ y B@@ ar@@ si@@ r and Qu@@ ali@@ ty Sa@@ ve were content with the DNA of 1 to 5 % .
&quot; Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , she should not have been present in the product &quot; , explained the British agency .
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in co@@ o@@ king dis@@ h@@ es broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests carried out in Ireland .
According to exam@@ inations by the European Commission , France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles w@@ ounded four people , early Friday , on the 1@@ 31 road , in Lan@@ audi@@ ère .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ h , a car driver who was moving north , in Sain@@ t-@@ F@@ eli@@ x@@ -@@ de Val@@ o@@ is , lost his ma@@ ster@@ y of his vehicle and co@@ ff@@ ed a car that arrived in the other direction .
The four occup@@ ants of the two vehicles were w@@ ounded , but they di@@ dn &apos;t fear for their lives .
The traffic was back to normal at 6 , Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make b@@ agg@@ age pay for hand b@@ agg@@ age
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to make up to $ 100 for passengers carrying hand b@@ agg@@ age on his flights .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines plans to start making up to $ 100 for a hand b@@ agg@@ age and $ 2 for a coffee or a so@@ da , although in his announcement Wednesday , she said that passengers could take the un@@ open can@@ te with them to the down@@ fall of the plane .
New hand b@@ agg@@ age costs concern the bag@@ s that are in the higher compar@@ tment , so the small bag@@ s inst@@ alled under the sie@@ ge will always be free .
B@@ ans said that she would make $ 25 if the fees were paid in advance and $ 100 if travellers only paid once at the door of bo@@ arding .
The spokesman for Fron@@ tier , K@@ ate O O O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley said that $ 100 were planned to inc@@ ite travel@@ ers to pay the costs in advance .
&quot; We don &apos;t want to make this price pay , &quot; she explained .
Air@@ lines started making the first and second lu@@ gg@@ age registered in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who tried to avoid these expenses would put as many things as they could in the hand lu@@ gg@@ age row in superior compar@@ tments , so there was often no room in these compar@@ tments .
These expenses are a way to ensure that passengers transport fewer things on board .
O@@ O Mal@@ ley said these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It &apos;s a question of making the most loyal clients understand that it &apos;s becoming more and more difficult to find room in superior compar@@ tments .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who buy their ticket on the company &apos;s site will not have to pay .
For example , a passenger qu@@ eu@@ ing at a bo@@ arding door door could transport a ba@@ g free , while the next person in the tail could have to pay $ 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
O@@ O Mal@@ ley explained that the site and the recording procedures of Fron@@ tier are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these expenses before coming to the door .
Fron@@ tier lu@@ gg@@ age fees will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often run on b@@ agg@@ age fees and other expenses , but the airlines love them .
They think that the costs of handling b@@ agg@@ age are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it .
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of b@@ agg@@ age fees as a sign that the airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them di@@ dn &apos;t hit b@@ agg@@ age fees .
S@@ pi@@ ri@@ t Air@@ lines . had applied the first b@@ agg@@ age fees three years ago , and the lo@@ w@@ -@@ co@@ co@@ t Al@@ le@@ gi@@ ant company followed a little later .
The only other company imposing such expenses is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , said the consul@@ tant with air companies J@@ ay S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , which closely follows the fees .
He estimated , in a December 2011 report , that S@@ pi@@ ri@@ t &apos;s hand fees reported $ 50 M per year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former Mid@@ west Air@@ line framework , recently travel@@ ed on S@@ pi@@ ri@@ t and won@@ dered what he was going to find at the bo@@ arding door when passengers would discover the unusual lu@@ gg@@ age fees imposed by the company .
&quot; I had never seen such a flu@@ id bo@@ arding procedure as all my professional career &quot; , he said .
I expected to see te@@ eth and a b@@ agg@@ ard bur@@ st at the door .
The plane was full , he added , &quot; passengers are on board at the speed of the light &quot; .
Fron@@ tier also acts like S@@ pi@@ ri@@ t and applies $ 2 for a coffee , a te@@ a , a so@@ da or fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier has indicated that passengers who take a so@@ da or fruit ju@@ ice can take the can@@ te un@@ open with them , and those who take coffee can be served free of charge .
It will always distribute water free .
U@@ S Air@@ ways briefly tried to make drinks pay for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other large airline had followed .
The decision of the Fron@@ tier to make hand lu@@ gg@@ age fees when passengers do not buy their ticket directly with the airline is his last effort to encourage clients to go on his website .
Air@@ lines pay for online travel sel@@ lers like Or@@ bit@@ z 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
This encouraged all the airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of talking to an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier has gone further in this area .
In September , she started to offer only half of fi@@ de@@ lity to customers who buy their ticket via an online travel agency .
Wednesday , she reduced the mix premiums by 25 % on a trip .
For example , a Fron@@ tier trip to an online travel agency purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to win 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Fron@@ tier site .
Fron@@ tier has a loyal cli@@ ent in his home city , Den@@ ver , but his activity is declining and she loses money .
The reci@@ pes have fallen by 9 % and its flight capacity has decreased by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published by its parent company , Re@@ public Air@@ ways holding Hol@@ dings .
Re@@ public tried to get rid of Fron@@ tier &apos;s finances by selling the airline .
The N@@ SA calls into question a &quot; internal error &quot; and not the ha@@ c@@ kers for its site .
The National Security Agency working in the shad@@ ows said Friday that it was a bun@@ ch that caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , not ha@@ c@@ kers , as some had claimed in line online .
&quot; N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v remained in@@ accessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a planned update &quot; , indicated the sp@@ ying agency in a declaration by em@@ ail .
The problem will be solved tonight .
The claims that the breakdown was due to a denial service attack &#91; D@@ S@@ D &#93; are false .
Ear@@ lier tonight , online ser@@ vers of ser@@ vers noted that the N@@ SA site had been broken for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokesman indicated in A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the sensitive internal network of the agency was &quot; not at all &quot; compromise .
No classified information is in danger , explained the spokesman .
At least a group of online ha@@ ac@@ k@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts claimed to be responsible for the N@@ SA &apos;s failure by an attack D@@ S@@ D .
D@@ S@@ D attacks aim to flood a specific site until the ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
The cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not destined to enter the internal network of the targeted system .
The N@@ SA once secret , a time named the &quot; N@@ o Su@@ ch A@@ gen@@ c@@ y &quot; , found itself under the spot@@ light and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its vast communications monitoring programs at national and abroad . - who are among the N@@ SA secret files stolen from the agency and lea@@ ked by the former dis@@ en@@ chan@@ ted N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den .
This growing controversy around the agency caused a lot of speculation according to which tonight &apos;s accident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
The Del@@ ta C@@ entr@@ ta now closed
Del@@ ta C@@ inter@@ -@@ V@@ ille has closed its doors on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that had the edi@@ fic@@ e sold it to promo@@ ters who will transform it into student homes .
Three hundred and fifty people were working at the ho@@ tel .
Among them , 200 have still not found a new job .
Del@@ ta promises not to let down his employees .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers came to meet employees directly there , we met with employees individually to evaluate their needs .
&quot; This f@@ ren@@ ch will continue for the next six months &quot; , explains the regional director of the work relations of Ho@@ tel Del@@ ta , F@@ eli@@ x B@@ is@@ son .
The closure of the Del@@ ta comes in a very competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that had this buil@@ der had choices to make .
Either he re@@ invested in the building to continue to work , so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very f@@ ero@@ ci@@ ous , there are many new hot@@ els that appeared in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&quot; Either he di@@ dn &apos;t sell it to someone else and it &apos;s what happened &quot; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ra@@ t , the holder of the C@@ ar of tourism Trans@@ at to the Scho@@ ol of Sci@@ ences of U@@ Q@@ A@@ M .
Other Mon@@ tre@@ al hot@@ els will also be converted in the next few months , as the C@@ rown P@@ la@@ za will become a residence for older people .
Meanwhile , four ho@@ tel projects tot@@ alling almost 600 cham@@ bers will see the light of day in two years .
For T@@ ot@@ a &apos;s CE@@ O , &quot; The project to buy Go@@ od@@ year A@@ mi@@ ens starts with zero employee &quot; .
Having thrown up it with f@@ ren@@ ch in January for the partial recovery of the Am@@ en@@ s-@@ North Go@@ od@@ year site promised to close , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , the CE@@ O of American ty@@ p@@ ma@@ ker Tit@@ an , is now declaring himself ready to save 3@@ 33 jobs on 1 137 that counts . The factory .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ burg , Minister of productive recovery , announced it on Monday 21 October .
Having given up on the plan to buy the factory in January , you come back today .
You had pronounced violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about &quot; so-called workers , &quot; who &quot; work three hours &quot; per day , &quot; cra@@ zy &quot; unions , aiming at C@@ G@@ T .
We don &apos;t understand this U@@ -@@ turn .
Is it to please Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg ?
I &apos;@@ m not trying to please anyone .
Ex@@ cep@@ t for my wife .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg , is a ch@@ arming young man trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs .
If I w@@ ounded someone with my words , I am sorry .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Does the truth hurt you ?
S@@ even hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours hin@@ dering France .
In India , in China and in many other countries , we work 10 to 12 hours per day .
But I have no prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is located and has sp@@ aces to expand .
Why does Tit@@ an have so much need of this factory ?
You don &apos;t need to buy this factory .
But , with a proper price and skilled workers , it &apos;s worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year ?
If , since the closure of the factory , Go@@ od@@ year had offered employees a good departure allowance , I think 100 % of employees would have accepted it .
Now , imagine that Tit@@ an bought the closed factory at Go@@ od@@ year .
So Tit@@ an could move the machines to Poland or any other country of the European Union that still has its own currency .
I think that Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg knows this .
Well , he wants to keep the factory in A@@ mi@@ ens with at least 3@@ 33 well paid jobs .
Ti@@ tan agrees to recru@@ it some of the 1 200 current employees of Go@@ od@@ year .
Also , Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a Ti@@ tan engagement before trying to get the C@@ G@@ T to sit at the table with Go@@ od@@ year .
The first step is that the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year seal an agreement on the departure allowances for all employees .
So there will be no employees at the factory .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you were ready to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm it ?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he wants a four@@ -year guarantee .
But , as I told you , the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year must first agree on starting allowances .
If all employees accept them , the plan to buy the factory starts with zero employee .
How can we give guarantees of job duration when there are no employees left on the site ?
If Mr Mon@@ te@@ bour@@ g succe@@ eds in getting the C@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ year to agree and Tit@@ an buy the factory , we intend to stay in A@@ mi@@ en@@ s-@@ North more than four years ago .
The benefit of B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er falling , while deli@@ veries and orders of planes go backwards .
B@@ om@@ lar@@ er In@@ c , Canadian aircraft manufacturer and railway company , sign@@ alled a 15 % fall in its net profit Thursday , under the pressure of a decrease in orders and deli@@ veries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its division .
B@@ om@@ lar@@ di@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , has also not provided the@@ ft test data for all new C@@ Ser@@ ies or information to know if the plane will respect its ambitious calendar of commercial service before September .
After the inaug@@ ural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago , it only stolen three times , and the question then asked if the test phase was on the right track .
The results did not match up to the forecast and the share price fell 8 % on the Tor@@ onto stock market .
Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st in the National Bank Finan@@ ci@@ al , low@@ ered on Thursday his rating , moving from &quot; over@@ performance &quot; to &quot; sector performance &quot; because of the low growth potential of the stock exchange during the next quarter or the next two quar@@ ters .
&quot; Although the fall in aircraft deli@@ veries was largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Di@@ division &quot; , declared Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a note to customers .
We think that B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er will register new orders for her C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft as the flying test program progres@@ ses .
However , if no new order is announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more skep@@ tical about the program .
B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er hopes that the family of aircraft C@@ Ser@@ ies will be able to cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the lower seg@@ ment of a market today dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and took away for the first time in September after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft is modest until now . 17@@ 7 . It seems that potential bu@@ yers wait for the results of flight tests to valid@@ ate the company &apos;s claims about energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new line air@@ lin@@ er .
At the moment , society recorded a total of 40@@ 3 orders and purchasing obligations with 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ must , president and head of the management , is convinced that B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er will reach his goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial service of the first plane .
The leaders also reassured analy@@ sts and the media Thursday by telling them that the program was moving in line with the calendar .
&quot; The test plane has not stay@@ ed in the ground longer than planned &quot; , said Mr. Be@@ au@@ must at a telephone conference , adding that the ground tests and software up@@ dates were planned during the time when the plane was stopping .
Each manufacturer is planning differently .
We decided to take a first flight and to plan an update period , and that &apos;s what we did .
This will be repeated throughout the flight program .
The second of the five test planes should ste@@ al in the coming weeks , the others will follow shortly after , indicated society .
Yet analy@@ sts are skep@@ tical about the fact that the first customer can ste@@ al a C@@ Ser@@ ies plane only 12 months after his inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er has indicated that she was in the process of assessing the tim@@ esc@@ ale of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months .
&quot; This slow@@ ness in flight flight - although apparently in line with the internal calendar of B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er - reinforces our opinion that the entry into service will be re@@ leg@@ ated in the first quarter of 2015 &quot; , said Mr. Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
In the third quarter closed on September 30 , the net benefit of B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er fell to $ 14@@ 7 M , or 8 c@@ ents per action , compared to $ 17@@ 2 M , or 9 c@@ ents per action , one year earlier .
The result by adjusted action has remained intact at 9 c@@ ents .
The income has slightly back@@ sli@@ ded from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 M@@ d .
An@@ aly@@ sts expected a result of 10 c@@ ents per action and $ 4.@@ 56 M@@ d income , according to Thomas Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / E / E / S@@ .
The fourth a@@ ero@@ space manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter , compared to 57 a year earlier .
N@@ et orders fell to 26 aircraft , compared to 83 before .
The delay in the A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics division represented $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 $ until 30 September , which changed compared to 31 December of the previous year .
&quot; In A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics , the results were in line with our predic@@ tions , but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing &quot; , said Mr. Be@@ au@@ must .
A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics income has fallen by 13 % to $ 2 M@@ d .
B@@ om@@ lar@@ di@@ er , the biggest railway manufacturer in the world , said that the income of this division had increased by almost 11 % to 2.@@ 1 M@@ d .
The order of order of the Trans@@ -@@ Sport division total $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ d at 30 September , which is a small increase compared to 31 December of the previous year .
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from implementing problems concerning a few big contracts .
The leaders announced that new information would be provided during the fourth quarter .
B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er &apos;s course , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ch@@ et@@ te , leader of Google In@@ c &apos;s financial management , would sit on the board of directors , has dropped from 8@@ .5 % to Canadian $ 4.@@ 83 on Thursday afternoon .
Brazil &apos;s company Em@@ bra@@ er SA , third a@@ ero@@ space manufacturer in the world and competi@@ tor closest to B@@ om@@ b@@ lar@@ er , indicated Thursday a 10 % decrease in its quar@@ terly profit .
Two 3@@ 2@@ 3@@ olog@@ ists of 23 and 27 years old were missing in a cha@@ s@@ m under the De@@ ath of Cro@@ ps since Thursday night , they learned on Friday with the rescue S@@ p@@ é@@ pe@@ o of the Is@@ ère .
They were located this sel@@ f@@ afternoon .
Both men , a cra@@ zy in practice and the other no , were on the ground on Thursday at 9.@@ 30 p@@ m to carry out a cross from the De@@ ath of C@@ l@@ ass , located on the municip@@ ality of Sain@@ t-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re-@@ de-@@ Char@@ tr@@ ous .
We were without any news since then , specified the same source .
&quot; S@@ p@@ é@@ le@@ olog@@ ists should have come out around 5@@ h in the morning &quot; , said Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry L@@ arre@@ be , a technical advis@@ er to the assistance organization .
Do@@ z@@ ens of people on the ground
Some 20 sec@@ ur@@ ists , 10 civilian members of the French rescue office , as well as police , CA@@ R@@ S and fire@@ fighters were there .
At the end of this afternoon this Friday , both sp@@ é@@ m@@ é@@ olog@@ ists were located .
&quot; It &apos;s another group of sp@@ é@@ m@@ é@@ olog@@ ists who , having found them exhausted but in good health in the ca@@ val@@ ier , passed on the information to one of the emergency teams engaged in the network &quot; explains Le D@@ au@@ ph@@ all .
The two soldiers at the 13@@ th bat@@ tal@@ ion of the Ch@@ ass@@ ers al@@ pine Cha@@ m@@ b@@ é@@ ry , were found &quot; exhausted but un@@ injured &quot; .
They lost in the network , went back to their steps waiting for the rescue , specified the pre@@ fec@@ ture .
Re@@ n@@ our@@ ished , they should come out with the help of sec@@ ur@@ ists in the evening .
German journalists invited to flee Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o
The German journalists &apos; union has invited its members Thursday to stop using Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o online services in the wake of new re@@ vel@@ ations about the activities of US and British intelligence services .
&quot; The German Federation of Jour@@ n@@ alists recommends to journalists to avoid using search engines and Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mess@@ aging engines until again &quot; , she says in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
She thinks &quot; scandalous &quot; the information from the Washington Po@@ st , according to which the National American Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) and the UK Government He@@ ad@@ quar@@ ters ( G@@ C@@ H@@ Q ) have collected m@@ asses of information by inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the international networks that allow both firms to syn@@ chron@@ ize Their ser@@ vers .
&quot; Research by journalists is as confidential as the details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &quot; , added Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ k@@ en , the president of the union who claims 3@@ 8@@ ,000 members .
Very re@@ pain@@ ted : a deputy asks for Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te &apos;s resignation .
Minister Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te &apos;s plan for &quot; re@@ connec@@ ting &quot; traffic lights in Brussels doesn &apos;t like everyone .
As a reminder , Brussels Minister Brussels has launched a test project on Thursday in the center of Brussels to re@@ pain@@ t 16 po@@ les of traffic lights in the region at y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ors from Brussels .
The goal is simultaneously &quot; to increase security &quot; and &quot; the Brussels identity &quot; .
The idea is , in the long run , to re-@@ pain@@ t all the traffic lights in Brussels , at an estimated cost of about one million euros .
But the blue chosen by the minister is &quot; too bl@@ ank &quot; , according to the Brussels deputy Em@@ manu@@ el De Bo@@ c@@ k who talks about &quot; Flem@@ ish &quot; of the capital and demands the &quot; resignation &quot; of Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te groupings .
&quot; No content to spend cra@@ zy money from Brussels in the fac@@ ul@@ ty fac@@ ul@@ ty operations of the Brussels R@@ region , &quot; Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te G@@ é@@ g@@ it@@ te is continuing his fu@@ tu@@ re-@@ fire operations in the Cap@@ it@@ ol . &quot; Mr De Bo@@ c@@ k re@@ sto@@ res . In a communi@@ qu@@ é .
After his tax@@ is j@@ a@@ un@@ e-@@ man@@ gu@@ e-@@ black , she finally re@@ pain@@ ted itself in j@@ a@@ us@@ e-@@ blue black blue in Brussels .
According to the honourable Member , there is now &quot; no more difference of vis@@ u@@ el@@ ism from F@@ landers and Brussels &quot; .
Brussels laws deserve better than seeing their money squ@@ an@@ dered by a minister C@@ D &amp; V itself that does the N@@ V@@ A program itself .
It &apos;s high time to stop the Tro@@ j@@ an horse of F@@ landers .
&quot; To remind you , Bri@@ g@@ it@@ te Grou@@ tw@@ els was elected only with 2 2@@ 45 votes or 0@@ .5 % of Brussels ! &quot; , Mr De Bo@@ ck concluded .
The P@@ on@@ t-@@ B@@ -B@@ uc@@ is por@@ n .
P@@ on@@ t-@@ de-@@ -B@@ u@@ is &apos;s Eco@@ tax por@@ k , around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday morning , was disman@@ tled Thursday morning .
Com@@ pan@@ ies arrived on the spot shortly after 10 hours , and traffic on the national was hi@@ j@@ acked in the aftermath .
The decision of dismantling , announced by the P@@ ref@@ ec@@ ture of the Fin@@ ist@@ ère Wednesday , was taken by the company E@@ Com@@ v , manag@@ er of the por@@ k .
This is the last of the three eco@@ taxes that are in the state to work in the department of Fin@@ ist@@ ère , the other two having been disman@@ tled or sab@@ ot@@ aged .

Five years ago , that my father er@@ ased from the world of live .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking about him at the present ,
I had so sc@@ ared of forgetting it or rather I di@@ dn &apos;t know how I was going to continue to &quot; attend &quot; .
There is no recipe , mode of employment to go through the wall of the in@@ visible and find them again .
Then there were signs .
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I drive .
Another time , a show@@ er in the middle of the night to watch his show who no longer leaves me , asked on the night table .
It &apos;s the image of my s@@ mil@@ ing father who ac@@ companies me in my gesture on a daily basis .
Our mother left after her fight exha@@ u@@ sting cancer .
At least that &apos;s what I thought the day I found his body empty , cryst@@ alli@@ ed on this hospital bed with sh@@ red@@ ded flags .
Similarly , his fun@@ eral was a ic@@ ac@@ ial f@@ are@@ well focused on the meag@@ re light of the can@@ als who fram@@ ed his co@@ ff@@ in .
I thought she was part .
L@@ it@@ tle by little , by small news stories , a little ti@@ mid , a little er@@ ased , she quickly returned to my mind , moving forward as she took up her place in the landscape of my thought that thought she was in m@@ our@@ ning .
And then , she turned out to be revealing my own fac@@ ets that I had not yet seen , m@@ asked by my relationship with her .
I therefore learned and understood that I had in no way lost the person of my mother but simply a woman I di@@ dn &apos;t really know , a woman who embo@@ died this person , during his stay in life .
By dying , this woman had perfect her life and released the person I helped , and here I found her , full and complete .
This de@@ tour of my life remains the most anticipated and beautiful .
It &apos;s a privilege to know that people like them never leave us .
I look like my father , &quot; both inside and outside &quot; .
I have always told me that .
I never believed it at the time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , sick .
Here , I &apos;@@ m no longer afraid of him and I was able to love it .
One day , he &apos;s dead .
For a long time , he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was sc@@ ared , when I had bad ...
He told me , I constantly encouraged , he lived my body .
I saw his hands watching mine , I l@@ ent her my body .
But it was never in@@ discre@@ et .
I was able to have a personal life .
He left me in@@ tim@@ ate .
It lasted a long time and one day he left .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged and advised .
I don &apos;t know who said that people who died are not forgotten but in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer but I &apos;@@ m constantly making them close to me .
Each event , every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them : what would they say ? What would they think ? What would they think ? They are doing ?
I constantly dream of them , maybe not all ni@@ ghts but several times per week is sure .
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late , only , there is always something that prevents me from doing this moment .
I often wake up when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence .
Sometimes , some dreams lead me on the contrary and are part of my history and indeed , they continue to live and share my life .
The day before my ho@@ o@@ graphy where I had to know the sex of my baby , I dre@@ am@@ ed that I wo@@ ke up , I was sh@@ un@@ ning out of the bed , my father expected me on the bos@@ s and he was s@@ mil@@ ing and rejo@@ ic@@ ing that I &apos;@@ m waiting for a little bo@@ y .
The next day , I had the feeling he visited me in my sle@@ ep for telling me that he was happy to share what happened to me .
And of course , it was a little bo@@ y in my home .
I liked to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell this common memory lived after his death .
Just five years ago , my grand@@ mother was dying of cancer .
One year before , she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
That means the shock his disappearance caused for the young b@@ ast@@ lier that I was at the time .
In spite of everything , I did my m@@ our@@ ning pretty quickly .
But she continues to influence my life , especially when I find myself in trouble , or when I have to take important decisions .
C@@ alling Arab@@ ic and interested in the Middle East , to the point of making it a master in a big school , have not been , with hin@@ d@@ sight , an@@ od@@ ine choices .
In fact , I often heard it talk about Arab in my childhood , and talk about Morocco , where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values she has accused me are always present , so I can think of how she would like me to act at some point .
The same applies to my attitudes : I &apos;@@ m trying to live up to the generosity and spirit of the spirit of the one who was a fer@@ vent beli@@ ever .
From now on , I feel it like a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent soul , a sal@@ v@@ ator spirit .
I see his eyes ask me .
My mother died nine@@ teen years ago now .
De@@ ath to the phone .
I went through all stages : in@@ comprehen@@ sion , anger , pain , pain that is going on alone , anywhere , when , in unusual places , in@@ con@@ gr@@ u@@ us moments .
Then , time appe@@ aled .
It stay@@ ed only the lack , this void without an answer , this need for her , to give me reas@@ surance at the cre@@ am of her swe@@ et .
However , she is here , silent presence , she is there and watching me .
Every morning , I see his eyes worried about me , I see the s@@ ons who increase his ga@@ ze , the la@@ kes around the li@@ ps dig@@ ging the cigarettes , the pl@@ ars that mark the face for days of concern .
My mother took my face and she looks at me every morning in my mir@@ ror .
And every morning , I hi@@ j@@ ack my eyes .
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died from cancer to 43 years old .
We constantly feel his protection , nothing serious can happen to us .
It was his promise on his pain bed , so we slowly learned to s@@ mile , and pronoun@@ ce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I &apos;@@ m talking to him in the cr@@ unch of the night when the absence is too bad , she inv@@ ites himself in my dreams when the mor@@ ale is a little reached .
We feel like and protected in difficult times , the re@@ treat of time makes us realize how much she was a or@@ che@@ str@@ a and we try to stay in the path she had drawn us .
If someone liked you very much , the absence can &apos;t gr@@ ind you out of the heart and memories .
In a way , being loved becomes your domestic energy .
I lost my father on August 22 , 2008 , as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked .
I could not attend his in@@ hum@@ ation and three weeks after his death , I gave a little bo@@ y .
If I have my sometimes different convictions from his own , I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things .
I also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me , it &apos;s impossible to go in the opposite direction , I don &apos;t sle@@ ep and I always wonder what it will think about it .
I don &apos;t know if I adopted its way of being or if I &apos;@@ m just like him : is it genetic ?
In any case , he will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a alter@@ -@@ e@@ go , there was no need to talk between us .
In short , it &apos;s there on a daily basis .
I feel his presence and that makes me happy .
That &apos;s almost 30 years since my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years old .
The immense punishment that then inv@@ aded me , of course , has moder@@ ated but it &apos;s always close to me .
Very often he &quot; lan@@ ded &quot; in my dreams in such a precise way , so alive , I &apos;@@ m even sad to see that it was only a dream .
The other night , he asked me if I was going , I told him no , he replied to me &quot; I &apos;@@ m des@@ cen@@ ding &quot; but from a voice so real that I wo@@ ke up , an@@ gu@@ ish , and I lit the ha@@ ir lam@@ p by looking everywhere , convinced that he was going to go . arrived .
I still live in the same house , and often , I feel observed and I turn to see if he is@@ n &apos;t there , I know it &apos;s him and I &apos;@@ m talking to him .
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy .
For nothing , I &apos;@@ m not leaving this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me .
I have 8 years , I have always lived alone since his departure , he &apos;s and will remain love for my life .
I want to make it clear that I &apos;@@ m soci@@ able with a job with responsibility , I &apos;@@ m looking and I &apos;@@ d love , I &apos;@@ m grand@@ mother , I &apos;@@ m a lot of friends , but my heart and soul belong to her and I &apos;@@ m never talking about him except my son , and I &apos;@@ m never going to the c@@ eme@@ tery .
Iraq : October was the bloo@@ di@@ est month since 2008 .
October was in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008 .
This Friday , the official figures published the official figures : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month : 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 police officers and 44 soldiers .
This published day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants help from the United States .
&quot; We don &apos;t say to the world to be on our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we &apos;@@ re part of it &quot; , said Al@@ -@@ M@@ ali@@ ki this Thursday in Washington .
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled , it will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also expand .
And what happens when a terrorism virus lives ? It &apos;s spread .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
O@@ ut@@ side of the building , protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader .

Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years old , gave information to the l@@ ord of the crime N@@ il S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh .
The lawyer was afraid that his secre@@ tive addiction to drugs was revealed in the open .
He was sentenced to three years imprisonment by the Li@@ ver@@ pool Court of Li@@ ver@@ pool .
A great defence lawyer , who informed a drug drug of a significant police investigation because he was afraid that his secre@@ tive addiction to drugs was revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years old , gave sensitive information to the l@@ ord of the crime N@@ il S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh about surveys of his activities related to drug trafficking after having compromised because of his habit of consuming co@@ c@@ ain@@ e .
The lawyer , who was called &quot; Bas@@ h &quot; and considered by the criminals as a &quot; file of first importance &quot; , was arrested at his house in 2011 following police inter@@ c@@ eption operations directed at S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , which he represented during a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
Police officials re@@ pai@@ red Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 years , tabling three co@@ c@@ ain@@ e bag@@ s at the house of the lawyer in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , while he attended a Bar@@ re@@ au din@@ ner with colleagues .
Sur@@ ve@@ ys revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a &quot; regular consumer &quot; of this class drugs after tests showed co@@ c@@ ain@@ e trac@@ es in his ha@@ ir , on his wal@@ let and credit cards .
O@@ ut of a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough account and one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were watched at the time by the police in an important investigation into the trafficking of hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e taking place in coun@@ ties of Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
With 32 other men , they were then imprisoned after the police confisc@@ ated hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for a £ 1.5 M amount , as well as more than £ 200 000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to the criminals because he was worried that his drug drug was revealed in the open .
Today , at the Li@@ ver@@ pool Court of Li@@ ver@@ pool , which works in the cabinet of lawyers For@@ bes Solidarity located in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , has fallen into dis@@ thanks after being found guilty on two charges of hin@@ dering justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He recognized the ownership of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e during a previous audience .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he had regularly been in phone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators followed the suspect and re@@ ne@@ ged him on the home at Di@@ t@@ ta and put drugs , pure at 60 % , under the b@@ ast@@ ard of the lawyer in a black gol@@ f g@@ ate .
S@@ hor@@ tly after the deposit , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough has regularly been in phone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta who was at a din@@ ner at E@@ wood Par@@ k &apos;s so@@ cc@@ er stad@@ ium , pregnant with the Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n club .
The lawyer has gone back home , discovered drugs and they phone nine times .
The court heard that Di@@ t@@ ta was a &quot; regular consumer &quot; of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests showed trac@@ es of this class drugs A A drug in his ha@@ ir , on his wal@@ let and credit cards .
Di@@ t@@ ta was stopped later but denied consuming co@@ c@@ ain@@ e . He said he had spoken about the alleged drug trafficking because it was his cli@@ ent and said that their discussions were subject to a &quot; legal privilege &quot; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta collection his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit cards , but they were all confisc@@ ated and they were taken from a ha@@ ir of ha@@ ir .
During an inter@@ rog@@ ation , he said he had an office at his home , as well as at his workplace and arrived that customers call him at home for legal questions .
But the court heard testi@@ monies according to which he called major actors in the drugs trade , some of whom he had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investig@@ ators were aware .
Public prosecutor An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : &quot; If someone has to know that you don &apos;t have to violate the law , it &apos;s a pen@@ alist lawyer . &quot;
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a pen@@ alist lawyer , and having become too involved with particular customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug traffic , but a drug trafficking drug providing drugs to his own lawyer .
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer .
But it went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
He hindered police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not hon@@ or his profession , but he dis@@ hon@@ ed him .
He got too close to certain clients , especially S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and he let him jeopardise his independence .
Di@@ t@@ ta denied illegal ag@@ itation and said : &quot; If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and if I wanted to provide Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough information , I would not have waited 3 hours , I would not have done it immediately . &quot;
But after the audience , the super@@ meaning Le@@ e H@@ al@@ ste@@ ad of the Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re Poli@@ tics said : &quot; Mr. Di@@ t@@ ta has gone from a criminal pen@@ alist to criminal himself as he started getting drugs with criminal organizations . &quot;
His co@@ c@@ ain@@ e addiction compromises him forever and made him vulnerable to the ul@@ ter@@ ior motives of the leaders of organised criminal groups who asked him to get useful information about police surveys .
L@@ aw@@ yers should observe the highest integrity rules and create a climate of confidence among the public .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta betra@@ yed this confidence and tried to shelter behind his profession &apos;s ven@@ e@@ er .
The unit responsible for serious and organized crime in Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re conducted the investigation on Mr. Di@@ t@@ ta , who was found guilty of the three indic@@ tments of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e ownership and now hin@@ dering justice , testi@@ fying of his commitment to prosecute criminals in court .
That this case should serve as a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law .
We will find you and you will translate into the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after having ple@@ aded guilty guilty for the trafficking of hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
35 other people involved in traffic have been sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years in prison for drug trafficking .
On his website , Di@@ t@@ ta organised a questions / answers session on himself during which he said that his dream &apos;s job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his last gu@@ est to din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali and the inequality would be what motiv@@ ates him . to work .

New demand for collective appeal against the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ i@@ x bro@@ thers
A new request for collective redress was lod@@ ged against the Sain@@ t-@@ C@@ bro@@ i@@ x bro@@ thers , concerning sexual assault that would have taken place this time at or@@ atory Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h and in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the shar@@ k &apos;s testi@@ mony , identified as &quot; J@@ . J &quot; . , who would have been m@@ asked in the 195@@ 0s , first of all in No@@ out@@ -@@ De@@ -@@ N@@ ei@@ ges by his prof@@ essor the bro@@ ther Sou@@ placed , and then by his conf@@ essor , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , at the or@@ ace . By Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h , where he was serving mass and where his father worked as pain@@ ter .
The first appeal aimed only at three establishments , and when you announced the regulation , many people told us : &quot; I was at that place , I can register ? &quot; , tell the lawyer Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ra@@ ult , who defends victims in both cases .
The collective appeal that has just been lod@@ ged is to allow the addition of complain@@ ants of any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ i@@ x con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation .
At the moment , the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ i@@ x bro@@ thers .
The alleged facts are usually older than those mentioned in the first resort , since several of the targeted establishments closed in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also points out that the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ i@@ x and the Sain@@ t-@@ Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ atory , which is a separate entity , &quot; allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children &quot; , that they &quot; exercised a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &quot; , that they &quot; were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless stif@@ led them &quot; , and they have &quot; consci@@ ously and consci@@ ously chosen to ignore the problem &quot; .
These latest accusations are based , among other things , on letters written by the Ad@@ voc@@ ate bro@@ thers &apos; lawyer , M@@ e E@@ mi@@ le Per@@ ri@@ in , in the 1990 &apos;s , but also by the sear@@ ches made in the archi@@ ves on this subject by the bro@@ ther of Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy , a former bro@@ e@@ te@@ y bro@@ ther . Lo@@ c@@ ating who publicly denounced the abuse .
Col@@ lec@@ tive redress must first take the step of ad@@ mis@@ sibility in the Supreme Court .
Once the ad@@ mis@@ sibility ad@@ mis@@ ds by the Court , we do the second stage , or the hearings on the background .
In the case of the first resort , the Sain@@ te@@ -@@ C@@ r@@ as@@ i@@ i@@ x con@@ g@@ reg@@ ation agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ able before hearings are conducted on the basis .
I@@ mp@@ act of fire in a trade
A fire has seriously damaged a trade in the L@@ Sal@@ le Ar@@ med For@@ ces in Mon@@ tre@@ al , on Thursday night on Thursday .
Re@@ li@@ ef was called to 1@@ h , Friday , because of a fire that declared on the sub@@ ground of a restaur@@ ant restaur@@ ant on the D@@ ol@@ ard aven@@ ue D@@ ol@@ ard , near the inter@@ section with the street R@@ ann@@ e .
The 3@@ r@@ d fire bri@@ g@@ ade that was sent out on the scene took almost an hour to control the bra@@ ke .
The fire &quot; caused significant damage to the structure of the building &quot; , indicated the head of the operations of the fire security service in Mon@@ tre@@ al , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in restaur@@ ants when the fire@@ men arrived on the scene .
There were no w@@ ounded , but almost 20 homes , located in the first and second floor of this row of commercial premises , had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross was requested because the residents of one of the apar@@ tments could have to be posted temporarily , indicated the I@@ M .
Many opposition to medical assistance to die at Congress .
The Canadian Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical assistance to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
It &apos;s an opportunity for several pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reas@@ ser@@ t their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to all@@ ay their suffering , in addition to being able to stay at home , very few would want to end their days , according to a spokesman of the Canadian Association for pal@@ lia@@ tive care , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ ou@@ et@@ te .
If we put the acc@@ ent on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the approach of eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia would become small .
The president of the Network for pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c also rejects the draft law on medical assistance to die .
If it is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ é@@ ry is worried about the consequences for the next generations .
&quot; What &apos;s the meaning of life &quot; , is it .
The majority of pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses refuse to help patients die , according to the deputy president of the pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses , Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne F@@ it@@ z@@ ub@@ back .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ ub@@ back , as directors of the Ma@@ thi@@ -@@ Franc@@ om@@ en@@ t-@@ S@@ av@@ y house in G@@ ati@@ n@@ au , thinks the service would be useless anyway .
We never ask us : &quot; I want to die , give me a injec@@ tion &quot; .
The director of the pal@@ lia@@ tive treatment of On@@ tari@@ o , R@@ ick F@@ ir@@ th , believes that the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c bill dis@@ orien@@ t@@ ates the population about the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He doesn &apos;t believe that On@@ tari@@ o will follow .
For its part , the liberal deputy of G@@ ati@@ e@@ au , St@@ é@@ ph@@ ania V@@ all@@ é , says that the notion of the end of life will have to be made clear before the draft law is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press is un@@ worthy of the controversial media law
&quot; It &apos;s a frigh@@ tening country and it &apos;s legitimate to ask ourselves the question : what will prevent Parliament from wi@@ ping out the independence of the judicial system tomorrow ? &quot; , said the newspaper said by con@@ testing the draft law and calling for it to be declared un@@ constitutional .
&quot; This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and very p@@ uni@@ tive , and we reject it &quot; , explained C@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ u , the chief executive of Cap@@ it@@ tal@@ F@@ M - owner of Cap@@ it@@ tal@@ F@@ M , one of the most respected independent radio and websites sites in Kenya .
He said that the new media court &quot; will always be biased because it &apos;s an extension of the government &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya &apos;s place in the world economy .
&quot; I hope the president will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this bill and send him back to the parliamentarians &quot; , he added .
According to The Sta@@ r newspaper , the new bill will allow the government to have &quot; the str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold on the media &quot; . The Stand@@ ard indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya &quot; had been hard &quot; and cas@@ tig@@ ated the bill calling him &quot; D@@ rac@@ i@@ ah . &quot;
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack perpetrated by armed Islamists in the West@@ g@@ ate commercial center last September .
The Ken@@ yan media gave rise to the anger of the authorities by dissem@@ inating images of video cam@@ er@@ as on which the troops deployed on the scene supposedly stolen from the luxury commercial center .
The chief of police , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ o , reacted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media officer to inter@@ rog@@ ate them , although the con@@ vocation was withdrawn following a c@@ lic@@ h@@ é in the media .
Under the new bill , the media will be able to be pun@@ ishable by up to 20 million sh@@ ill@@ ings Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &quot; radi@@ ated &quot; or of no official press acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the property of a offen@@ der if he has not paid his fine .
According to the D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , &quot; Even a single fine suffice to crip@@ ple most of F@@ M stations . &quot;
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya &apos;s &quot; anim@@ ated blo@@ go@@ sphere &quot; .
By reducing media silence , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
&quot; Nobody will ever know , &quot; wrote Mu@@ tu@@ ma Ma@@ thi@@ u , journalist in The N@@ ation , describing Ken@@ yan media as a key control source in public life .
&quot; Li@@ ve for themselves , politicians would go bankrupt and bring us back to hunting and cop@@ ing . &quot;
Ken@@ yan legislators have been the target of the anger of the population in the past .
In May , they took a position against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of salaries and rein@@ stated their mixed wages of about 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month exempt from tax - which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult year for pharmac@@ ists
The departure of almost 10 pharmac@@ ists at the C@@ enter for Health and Social Services ( CS@@ S@@ S ) of L@@ av@@ al caused a whole lot to the direction of the Ho@@ sp@@ ital of C@@ it@@ -@@ de-@@ Health , and this during 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
Because of multiple retirement , maternity or depar@@ t@@ mental leave at all times , the pharm@@ acy department has found itself highly staff@@ ed .
It was missing almost 30 % of the necessary staff , making this financial year &quot; very difficult &quot; , according to the head of the department , G@@ illi@@ an Be@@ au@@ d@@ and .
However , the CS@@ S@@ S decided not to hi@@ re independent workers , which can cost up to three times more than a full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist engaged pharmac@@ ist .
We did not use breakdown , explained Mrs Be@@ au@@ d@@ and .
We stream@@ ed or reduced some of our activities inside the institution to repair , the time things go again .
It &apos;s sure that we worked hard to interest our young people &#91; residents in pharm@@ acy &#93; to come and stay here .
There is a competition of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year .
Im@@ pro@@ vement .
After this difficult period , 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 will be much easier for the S@@ S@@ S pharm@@ acy department .
Already , three pharm@@ acies are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharm@@ acies have been hi@@ red in recent months .
Also , the efforts made by the department to with@@ hold fruit because the four students are currently living at L@@ av@@ al at L@@ av@@ al also decided to stay at the job of the CS@@ S@@ S .
Now it &apos;s much better , pointed out the pharm@@ acy .
By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity returns .
So it will come up our depar@@ tures from last year .
Increas@@ ing , ever growing ,
However , the situation is still difficult .
Several factors , like the lack of pharmac@@ ists in hospital or a predomin@@ ance of young women in the job , make situations like the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is still precarious , because we have a background that is young and we use a lot of young women , so with pregnan@@ cies , we almost always drive maternity leave when it &apos;s going well , she added .
The last year , we had a lot more and we do not have pharmac@@ ists who are available to make re@@ plac@@ ements , so it was more difficult .

Im@@ medi@@ ately , the director of the establishment took the evac@@ uation of the room and warned the fire@@ men for a suspect sm@@ ell .

She tries to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in c@@ lic@@ ks .
Taking advantage of H@@ all@@ al@@ we@@ en Day , a woman tried to get two k@@ ilo@@ grams of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e hidden in c@@ as , Thursday morning at Mon@@ tre@@ al T@@ ru@@ dea@@ u Air@@ port .
It was during the examination of the b@@ agg@@ age of the passenger that drugs could be detected .
Co@@ c@@ ain@@ e had been distributed in three cities since it had already been emp@@ tied .
drugs were then transported to the office of the Ro@@ yal Canada G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie ( G@@ R@@ C ) that took over in this investigation .
Canada &apos;s agency for border services ( AS@@ F@@ C ) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
This is part of the investigation , said J@@ bu@@ e@@ line Rob@@ y , spokesman for the AS@@ F@@ C .
What I can tell you is that she arrived in the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border services agents at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ dea@@ u Air@@ port have carried out 17@@ 3 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 co@@ c@@ ain@@ e se@@ iz@@ ures for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , border services agents in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region made a total of 16@@ 53 seize drugs .
Air air travel against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanon army , Israeli aircraft went into Lebanon &apos;s air space Wednesday at the beginning of this afternoon , but the strikes took place in the evening .
A con@@ sign@@ ment of short sol@@ air missiles ( SA@@ -@@ 8 ) missiles would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new ra@@ id of Ta@@ h@@ al aviation into Syria ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli daily newspaper Ha@@ are@@ z ) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria .
The ra@@ id took place in about the same circumstances as the one that took place on 5 July : at the time , it was also an an@@ onymous American official who confirmed at C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack , this time targeting sol@@ -@@ sea missiles Y@@ ak@@ h@@ have , delivered by Russia to Dam@@ as@@ cus .
Israeli officials had not hidden their irrit@@ ation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora low@@ ered the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of Ukraine on Friday , calling into question the ability of the former Soviet Republic , in a recession for more than a year , to face up to its financial obligations .
The country &apos;s public debt notes pass to &quot; B@@ - &quot; , sin@@ king into the category of speculative investments .
It is accompanied by a negative perspective , S &amp; P seeing at least one chance on three that it is once again low@@ ered within a year .
&quot; It &apos;s less and less likely that the government &apos;s strategy will allow enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs &quot; , explains the American agency .
The agency notes that the exchange reserves of Ukraine fell 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 and that the trend will continue .
It makes the re@@ payment of credits taken abroad more difficult .
These reservations , to which the authorities use mas@@ sively to support the local currency , the h@@ ry@@ v@@ ni@@ a , collap@@ sing , the agency is becoming more and more likely to be de@@ valued , which would inf@@ late its external debt .
Ki@@ v also needs cash to settle gas imports to Russia , acc@@ using him of not having paid $ 8@@ 82 million .
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its neighbour , Russia , fu@@ rious at the desire of Ki@@ v to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
She was made public in the day after the official statistics published showing that the country &apos;s economy had suffered between July and September her fifth quarter of contr@@ action .
Its indeb@@ tedness , still relatively modest , has explo@@ ded in recent years and S &amp; P estimate 3@@ 3@@ .5 % of GDP , compared to less than 10 % before the crisis of 2008-@@ 2009 .
The country , in budget deficit , has been calling for months for assistance from the International Monetary Fund , which granted it in 2010 a credit of $ 15@@ .@@ 3 billion and for now only made available 3.@@ 4 billion .
But the fund refuses to pay any new tran@@ che until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , especially by increasing gas prices to the population .
After a new unsuccessful mission in the country , the IMF noted this week that &quot; important external financing needs &quot; were &quot; a vulnerable &quot; , while raising &quot; signs of economic improvement . &quot;
However , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r Jo@@ ol@@ d , the Poli@@ tics Centre C@@ enter , &quot; we can &apos;t wait for a short term improvement &quot; .
&quot; There &apos;s little hope that unpopular reforms are launched in a pre-@@ election year &quot; , the presidential elections are planned in 2015 , comes up with the expert , inter@@ rog@@ ated at the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international climate .
S &amp; P also notes the &quot; uncertainty &quot; related to the possible signature of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , that Brussels depends on the release of the opposition Y@@ ou@@ li@@ a Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
&quot; Sign@@ ing the agreement would be positive for trade in the long run but there could be negative short@@ - and medium-term negative consequences related to the reaction of Russia &quot; , explained S &amp; P , which fears &quot; trade restrictions &quot; from Moscow .
Russia , which represents a quarter of Ukrainian exports , warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Ki@@ v , it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods .
Green H@@ ell@@ o of the United States .
Al@@ li@@ ed and Om@@ ni@@ co@@ m said Friday having received no objection from the American authorities for their fusion , thus coming closer to the creation of the first World Ad@@ ver@@ tising Agency .
The fusion indeed brings the second World agency , O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , and the third , u@@ b@@ b@@ is .
&quot; O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m Group and Public Pan@@ el have today announced the exp@@ ir@@ ation of the examination period of the previous fusion announced by the P@@ u@@ b@@ b@@ is Group and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , provided for by the Har@@ t-@@ S@@ co@@ t@@ t-@@ Ro@@ d@@ ino An@@ ti@@ les Im@@ pro@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ u@@ v@@ ors of 197@@ 6 , as amended &quot; , &quot; announ@@ ces both groups in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
They specify that they also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The exp@@ ir@@ ation of the examination period planned by the H@@ S@@ R in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation of the operation .
&quot; fusion is also condi@@ tioned by the achievement of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of shareholders of both groups &quot; , they add .
The Congolese army hun@@ t the M@@ 23 rebels .
The Congolese army ( F@@ AR@@ DC ) announced Thursday that its units were going to hun@@ t the M@@ 23 rebels up to their bases in the forests and the mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u ad@@ jac@@ ent to Rwanda and Uganda .
M@@ 23 seems to be on the point of being beaten after being hun@@ ted from the loc@@ alities in the nor@@ theast of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) that he controlled since the beginning , 20 months ago , of the insur@@ rec@@ tion .
&quot; We are going to continue M@@ 23 and make it work everywhere it hi@@ des because they are criminals &quot; , said in Re@@ u@@ ters O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokes@@ person for F@@ AR@@ DC .
We must not let them re@@ organize themselves because they &apos;@@ re mar@@ ty@@ red by the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come to bring the peace back .
O@@ ffici@@ als of M@@ 23 explained having evac@@ uated loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure and Ber@@ tr@@ and Bis@@ sim@@ wa , a politician of the re@@ bel@@ lion , said on F@@ R@@ FI that these military set@@ backs would not change his claims in any way to the peace talks .
The latter , according to the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , took up on Wednesday in K@@ am@@ pa@@ ala between the government of Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 .
B@@ un@@ ch@@ ys are reported in the h@@ ills that domin@@ ate B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , the last loc@@ ality in the hands of the insur@@ gents this week , as well as the surrounding R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a col@@ line where the M@@ 23 re@@ bel@@ lion saw the day in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , ma@@ ster@@ -@@ place of North Ki@@ v@@ u province , taking advantage of the government gar@@ ris@@ on gar@@ ris@@ on and the p@@ assi@@ vity of the blue hel@@ me@@ ts of Mon@@ us@@ co .
The fall of G@@ om@@ a brought the United Nations Mission in the DR@@ C , the most important in the world in terms of man@@ power , to strengthen its mandate and to train a quick bri@@ g@@ ade composed of South African soldiers , mal@@ es and tan@@ z@@ ians .
For its part , the F@@ AR@@ DC staff was re@@ worked and the army went to the offensive against M@@ 23 , making the course of the war change .
The rate of progress of government troops is unprecedented today .
&quot; Le M@@ 23 seems to be coming to an end &quot; , predicted an expert on Congolese affairs , J@@ as@@ son Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Si@@ as@@ a .
It would be historic - it would be the first time the Kin@@ sha@@ sa government managed to beat a major insur@@ rec@@ tion .
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group alli@@ ed in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DR@@ C .
UN experts accuse Rwanda , which fier@@ cely den@@ ies it , to support milit@@ arily the M@@ 23 , made up of former Congolese soldiers ma@@ im@@ ed .
The head of British diplomacy , Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , invited the Rw@@ and@@ an president Paul K@@ ag@@ ame to show restraint , announced a spokes@@ person of the Foreign Office .
Last week , K@@ ig@@ ig@@ i mentioned the possibility of military re@@ pris@@ als following the sh@@ ell@@ s falling into Rwanda .
Wednesday , the inhabitants of B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana took on the streets of the bour@@ g@@ ade to welcome the entry of the soldiers of the F@@ AR@@ DC .
&quot; We lived a year with M@@ 23 and it seemed un@@ imagin@@ able to us to one day liber@@ ated by the army , &quot; testi@@ fies a inhabit@@ ant of this local loc@@ ality of Uganda .
&quot; We lived in terror ( of M@@ 23 ) , we are tra@@ u@@ ma@@ tized &quot; , added this man .
The tests carried out by the Pa@@ ste@@ ur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by cor@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ us have proven negative , announced the Ministry of Health .
It states that &quot; the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two confirmed cases in France so far &quot; .
Tuesday , this 4@@ 3-@@ year-old patient had been suspected of being reached , after having returned from Saudi Arabia , a country where the disease has already killed 50 or so people .
Ch@@ ev@@ ron , the second American oil company , reported on Friday a decrease in its quar@@ terly profit due to the decrease in its refin@@ ing margins , while its production of oil and gas increased while remaining behind the group &apos;s objectives .
His net third profit in the third quarter reduced to $ 4.@@ 95 billion , or 2.@@ 57 dollars per action , compared to $ 5.@@ 25 billion , or 2.@@ 69 dollars per action , one year before .
An@@ aly@@ sts inter@@ viewed by Re@@ u@@ ters , on average , rely on a profit per Action of 2.@@ 71 dollars .
The group has produced 2.@@ 59 million bar@@ rel@@ s of oil equivalent per day during the quarter , rising compared to the 2.@@ 52 million b@@ alls produced a year before .
The company aims 2.@@ 65 million b@@ p@@ j for this year , with a 25 % growth of expected production by 201@@ 7 .
Most growth in the coming years will come from its liqu@@ e@@ fied natural gas projects in Australia .
Because of the cost of these projects , annual investment spending has increased by 7 billion dollars in two years and is expected to reach $ 3@@ 6.@@ 7 billion in 2013 .
The profits from production activities have reduced slightly in the third quarter , while the profits of down@@ stream activities ( including refin@@ ing and chemical production ) have fallen from 45 % to $ 3@@ 80 million .
This reduction in refin@@ ing margins affects the entire sector .
So Ch@@ ev@@ ron &apos;s main competi@@ tor , Ex@@ x@@ on Mob@@ il , reported on Thursday of a net net benefit , despite the increase in gas and oil production .
Scho@@ ol of eco@@ lier : complaint deemed admissible .
school / S@@ her@@ bro@@ o@@ ke school Commission ( CS@@ R@@ S ) demands from the beginning of the school year costs of $ 150 per pup@@ il ( up to a maximum of $ 300 per family ) for students benefiting from school transportation to two homes , a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so . to do it .
Before the changes in the last budget , no financial contribution was called for .
&quot; There &apos;s a medi@@ ating service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested &quot; , explains Mrs L@@ ef@@ at .
According to her , the CS@@ R@@ S has been invited to medi@@ ators and she asked for a further time to think about it .
&quot; It &apos;s always better to talk about it , to consult and find solutions &quot; , according to Mrs L@@ ef@@ at .
The school commission of the R@@ region de S@@ her@@ bro@@ o@@ ke ( CS@@ R@@ S ) did not want to comment .
The organization only meant that the medi@@ ation is part of the process during a complaint .
Im@@ bec@@ li@@ o about closing the emergency H@@ av@@ el@@ -@@ God emergency
Faced with the fron@@ t@@ loading carried out for several months by a portion of staff and several unions , including C@@ G@@ T , the Minister of Health , Mar@@ is@@ ol T@@ our@@ ain@@ e , decided on 10 July to &quot; discrepancy the implementation schedule of the project , and in particular the date of closing the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on 4 November &quot; .
An officially made request &quot; to not run any risk of dealing with emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &quot; but which was also aimed at not hin@@ dering the PS campaign a few months away from municipalities .
Despite ministerial instructions , the closure should still be effective on that date .
Even if , in A@@ PH@@ P , we prefer to use the term &quot; transformation &quot; or &quot; change in continuity &quot; .
From November 4 , the fi@@ re-@@ fighters <unk> who assured about a quarter of the 40 000 annual pass@@ ages to the emergency emergency in H@@ ô@@ -@@ God <unk> will all have been instruc@@ ted to take the 30 cases seriously per day to the emergencies of other Par@@ is@@ ian hospitals .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of inter@@ na@@ tives .
At H@@ av@@ el@@ -@@ God , the ur@@ gencies speci@@ alized in emergency medicine will leave room for five internal internal medicine on Monday .
As for the transfer of internal medicine be@@ ds , it is program@@ med for the course of the month .
&quot; The H@@ av@@ el@@ -@@ God emergency service must close in the shor@@ test time period , and for us , it &apos;s on 4 November &quot; , as@@ sures Lo@@ c C@@ he@@ on , the president of the A@@ PH@@ P Med@@ ical Committee ( CM@@ E ) , which supports the management &apos;s project .
&quot; On November 4 , there will no longer be patients brought by fire@@ men , only people coming from their own means &quot; confirms Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical officer of the new H@@ ed@@ el@@ -@@ God .
&quot; But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency &quot; , he hur@@ ts , claiming the permanent presence of S@@ M@@ U@@ R vehicles there to transfer serious cases .
Sen@@ ior physi@@ ci@@ ans doctors will stay there , he also as@@ sures .
But it &apos;s up to the AR@@ S to decide the closure of the emergency service for emergencies .
&quot; Things happen progressively &quot; , responds Nicol@@ as Pé@@ j@@ u , spokesman for the AR@@ S for whom , on November 4 , &quot; there will be no change in terms of service . &quot;
&quot; The Minister li@@ ed or li@@ ed to her &quot; , deplo@@ res the emergency doctor G@@ ér@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek .
D@@ em@@ on@@ str@@ ated from his position as leader of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R at the beginning of July for having conducted the fron@@ t@@ loading against the project of re@@ organisation , he defines himself as a &quot; early warning &quot; decision taken by &quot; the medi@@ o-@@ administrative techno@@ structure &quot; .
&quot; They are emp@@ t@@ ying and as@@ phy@@ xi@@ ating the emergencies that were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &quot; , he thinks .
For him , &quot; if the other Paris emergency services could absor@@ b the surplus , there would be no problem &quot; .
But they are regularly eng@@ ul@@ fed .
For example , there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the emergencies in L@@ ari@@ bo@@ is@@ ère .
To the AR@@ S , it is argued that 30 &quot; dis@@ pat@@ ch@@ ized &quot; patients on several sites are not likely to represent an &quot; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &quot; in other emergency services , the human means of which will also have been strengthened .
To the AR@@ S and A@@ PH@@ P , we defend the &quot; new hosp@@ it@@ ality model &quot; already set in motion since 7 October and which should continue to welcome 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , liberal general doctors should also come to participate in the creation of a &quot; permanent care permanent . &quot;
&quot; Where will we be if we ask people to diagno@@ se themselves &quot; , ask G@@ ér@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek who &quot; the not serious concept of emergency &quot; is &quot; dangerous &quot; and marks a &quot; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &quot; .
This will happen as in the case of maternity hospitals at level 3 .
People are not cra@@ zy , they &apos;@@ re going to go where there &apos;s the best care offer .
If the minister doesn &apos;t take action by Monday , we &apos;@@ ll change the bra@@ ke , warn Chris@@ top@@ he P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , emergency doctor and member of the C@@ G@@ T Health .
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we &apos;@@ ll think about putting forward a list .
In the N@@ ath@@ ali@@ e K@@ os@@ ci@@ us@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ oriz@@ et team , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , the Paris U@@ M@@ P de Paris and elected of 4@@ th ar@@ r@@ s@@ . clearly announ@@ ces that &quot; even if the Par@@ is@@ ian U@@ M@@ P was to keep the emergency God in God , it would be technically possible and financially impossible to re@@ open them if we go back to the responsibilities . &quot;
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the PS candidate , she said again Monday morning on France In@@ ter that she pronounced herself in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , she would mark her net disagreement , underlined B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , his spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of He@@ el@@ el@@ -@@ God has its legitimacy on the content , we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of def@@ er@@ ment to other hospitals .
Obama puts an end to the e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ ps aimed at the IMF and the World Bank .
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to put an end to the listen it used to on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicate a American official , Thursday .
This decision is part of the White House &apos;s attempt to take back N@@ SA &apos;s e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping case after the re@@ vel@@ ations made by the former analy@@ st Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , refugees in Russia .
This is the first time that the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the beginning of the scandal .
When asked about the subject , an American administration official replied : &quot; The United States does not carry out electronic surveillance targeting the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington &quot; .
Speaking under the stamp of an@@ onym@@ ity , this official di@@ dn &apos;t specify if such a monitoring had been put in place in the past .
Another official told him that Barack Obama had given order to stop these practices in past weeks .
This in@@ struction was given almost at the same time as the one putting an end to the ta@@ pping of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , Thursday , the Senate Int@@ elli@@ gence Int@@ elli@@ gence Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs , but allowed them to continue .
The committee introduced new data restrictions that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a limit of five years for the conservation of this information .
The UN welcomes the new goals for fighting poverty
The United Nations will start working now on a new set of goals aimed at replacing the goals of the Millennium Development ( M@@ DG ) , which were set up 12 years ago to fight against world poverty .
Australia &apos;s diplomats played a key role in highlighting &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; aimed at replacing the M@@ DG , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations summit on sustainable development that started the day before Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They were in the final preliminary draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , during the summit .
UN Secretary General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to &quot; go beyond national interests . &quot;
&quot; I am happy that the Member States agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals ( O@@ D@@ D ) &quot; , he added .
These O@@ D@@ D will rely on the progress made in the Millennium Development goals and will become an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do all I can to fulfil the mandate I was given by the Member States to realize our vision of sustainable development objectives that rely on the success of the M@@ DG .
The security concern in Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an is growing at the same time as conflicts break out between powerful person@@ alities .
At the feet of the stat@@ ue of S@@ am@@ a M@@ ach@@ el , the foun@@ der president of Mozambique , in the process of to@@ ying them , thousands of people gathered in the center of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to to sh@@ out peaceful slog@@ ans during a rare public demonstration .
&quot; We want peace to come back ; we want stability &quot; , declared V@@ anc@@ a from Sou@@ sa , a general director of an investment society .
In@@ qui@@ red for the future of his country , she exchanged her working clo@@ thes against a T@@ -@@ shir@@ t with the mention &quot; we want security &quot; in Portuguese before joining the am@@ assed crow@@ d on the place of the capital of the capital on Thursday .
For two weeks , there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Ren@@ <unk> , the worst c@@ lic@@ h@@ es since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago .
The Ren@@ <unk> was once a famous re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous movement , supported at the beginning by the R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia governed by wh@@ ites then the South African government of apar@@ theid in the context of efforts to destabili@@ ze the independent government of the country .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , she became an opposition party .
An@@ aly@@ sts think that the country should not rel@@ ap@@ se into an open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the North West could attract more than 50 $ of investments in the next few years from companies like Rio T@@ int@@ o , V@@ ale of Brazil , E@@ i of Italy and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko The United States .
F@@ re@@ m@@ o , the ruling party and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and Ren@@ <unk> reject responsibility for tensions .
The Ren@@ <unk> says that the government is behind the recent clashes and that it launched an attack against its members in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , a traditional bas@@ tion of Ren@@ <unk> , on October 17 .
The assault on the former rebels de@@ generated then when government forces attacked the bases of the Ren@@ <unk> and tried to kill A@@ fun@@ so D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama , the leader of the group , and Fer@@ nan@@ do Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , the spokesman of the Ren@@ <unk> , according to the Financial Times .
The government makes Ren@@ <unk> responsible responsible for spar@@ king conflicts , and acc@@ using him of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za tried to play down concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told the A@@ F@@ P , the French press agency , that Mr. D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama considered himself a &quot; los@@ er &quot; who wanted to use &quot; all the forces he left to try to prove he could impose his decisions in government &quot; .
F@@ re@@ m@@ o and Ren@@ <unk> insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern has grown after Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Ren@@ <unk> gave up the 1992 peace agreement .
He told F@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by F@@ re@@ m@@ o .
&quot; We want to resume the negotiations , but with the greatest seriousness &quot; , said Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
previous discussions between the parties have not succeeded in appe@@ asing the tensions fu@@ elled by a series of conflicts this year .
&quot; These are two great men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama ) who don &apos;t stop arguing &quot; , explained Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ an@@ l@@ on , a conf@@ er of the open and specialist university in Mozambique .
None of them know well to negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions .
The Ren@@ <unk> , which is in favor of electoral reform , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are planned for next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to get concessions and a war trea@@ sure from the government .
The portion of the votes collected by Ren@@ <unk> is constantly declining since 1992 , while a new party , the Democratic Movement of Mozambique ( M@@ D@@ M ) that was created by a former Ren@@ <unk> member , should get more votes in elections .
Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – who should leave at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&quot; He doesn &apos;t want a multi-@@ party democracy , he doesn &apos;t want transparent elections , he doesn &apos;t want peace because he doesn &apos;t want to leave the presidency &quot; , said Mr. Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
We don &apos;t know exactly what Ren@@ <unk> &apos;s capacity is , but she conducted disrup@@ tive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major North South motor@@ way axis .
Most of the ho@@ o@@ ks took place in the So@@ fa@@ a province , which is located several hundred kilometres north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where is Be@@ ira , the port where mining companies , especially Rio T@@ int@@ o and V@@ ale , export coal .
In June , Rio could not use the railway for about a week after Ren@@ <unk> threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a was fal@@ sely sh@@ y when asked if Ren@@ <unk> would re@@ it@@ ate this threat .
The Ren@@ <unk> wanted to &quot; warn the international community that things do not go well in Mozambique &quot; , pointed out to Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a .
In@@ instability has reinforced the fru@@ stra@@ tions of the government , says Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , director of Me@@ di@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media society , many people are also worried about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; People think that the people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and that it &apos;s up to them to find solutions to the problems &quot; , he explained .
Om@@ ar Su@@ ul@@ tu@@ ane , a manife@@ station , said that people only wanted stability .
&quot; Nobody ca@@ res about Ren@@ <unk> or F@@ re@@ m@@ o , they just want to find peace , they want to have free access to roads &quot; . He added .
We should teach children my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds like &quot; lifestyle models , &quot; says the author .
The Lo@@ st of Th@@ or could show that &quot; the brutal force does not weight the sub@@ tle ru@@ se &quot; , while ar@@ th@@ ur@@ ian le@@ gen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
Having said that many my@@ ths would be &quot; far too violent , far too scandalous and in some cases , far too ob@@ scene to be taught at school &quot; , Cro@@ ous@@ -@@ Holland has recommended a &quot; careful selection &quot; of adapted works at age .
&quot; I think it &apos;s great that in America , my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education . &quot; He said .
I have been advocating this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are &quot; openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &quot; means that children &quot; completely break &quot; , the messages being &quot; su@@ c@@ ked &quot; in pleasant stories .
B@@ s@@ s@@ leg@@ y@@ -@@ Holland , who translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon and wrote The Pen@@ gu@@ in Bo@@ ok of Nor@@ th@@ s and British Fol@@ k , said : &quot; You may have good intentions , but you prefer keep them out of sight . &quot;
Maybe the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything has to be easy or finish well , but there &apos;s a meaning that is un@@ born of good and bad .
And he must be sub@@ li@@ dent ; revealed through a story rather than declared .

S@@ hor@@ ting N@@ SA : the United States is &quot; went too far &quot; , ad@@ mits Ker@@ ry
The United States has sometimes gone &quot; too far &quot; when it comes to sp@@ ying , recognised Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in this first conf@@ ession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the United States and their European allies , this is the first time a American government official explicitly ad@@ mits controversial practices in the inter@@ c@@ eption by the N@@ SA of communications and data in Europe .
&quot; In some cases , I admit , as the president did , some of these actions went too far and we &apos;@@ ll make sure that it does not happen any@@ more &quot; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London which he participated since Washington Thursday , 31 October by video link .
In his speech broadcast , in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , the head of American diplomacy has long justified intelligence practices and information collection by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ king the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry assured that the American authorities had been playing many projects for attacks , thanks to the inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and the collection of information .
&quot; We did not prevent aircraft falling , buildings did not explo@@ de and people were killed , because we were able to know about these projects up@@ stream &quot; , argued the bos@@ s of American diplomacy .
And , said John Ker@@ ry addressed to the Europeans , &quot; I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been mis@@ led &quot; .
But we try to gather information .
&quot; And yes , in some cases it &apos;s gone too far &quot; , has still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
He assured him on Thursday night that President Obama was &quot; solved to try to clarify and carry out a review of these practices so that no one feels wrong &quot; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data of hundreds of millions of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o users .
The newspaper , which mentions documents obtained from the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , says that the program named &quot; M@@ U@@ S@@ C@@ U@@ LA@@ R , &quot; and conducted with the British N@@ SA side of the N@@ SA , G@@ C@@ H@@ Q , allows these two agencies to recover Data from the op@@ tical fi@@ b@@ res used by the internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , around 18@@ 1 million elements were collected in the only month of January last year - from meta@@ data on e-@@ ma@@ ils , to text parts or audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ cep@@ tions would take place outside the United States .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google have denied any link with these practices .
For ten days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , or Italy revealed that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted massive data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders , especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states and while lea@@ ks in the American press said that the American president was not aware of such e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ ps , Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
On the other hand , the bos@@ s of the powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ e@@ ith Alexander , denied him that his intelligence agency cap@@ tured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even sent the ball to the European intelligence services who would have taken these communications before providing them to the N@@ SA .
This would be about &quot; military operations &quot; in countries where these NATO allies collaborate with the United States and it would not aim at all in Europe , said General Alexander .
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday .
Indonesia has sum@@ mon@@ ed the Australia ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international sp@@ ying network that also gave rise to China .
Paris Sain@@ t-@@ Ger@@ hand will receive L@@ ori@@ ent Friday without his master &apos;s asset , the Swedish Z@@ la@@ an I@@ bra@@ h@@ him@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , announ@@ ces the League of Le@@ ga 1 club in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
The P@@ S@@ G , leader of the Cha@@ m@@ pion@@ ship in front of Mon@@ ac@@ o , unlike goals , broadcast the list of players selected for this match day , without it being attacked for 32 years .
The communi@@ qu@@ é simply states that he &apos;s &quot; w@@ ounded &quot; , without specifying the nature of the injury .
However , he was suffering from an inf@@ lam@@ mation of the left wing when he came back to selection , at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony in memory of the dec@@ e@@ ased de@@ pu@@ ties .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ ise organiz@@ es , at 11 hours , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the dec@@ e@@ ased creat@@ ures in his establishment during the year .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , a socialist candidate at the Paris town h@@ all , must attend , and then explain at a press conference her proposals regarding fun@@ r@@ aire .
To follow the ceremony , c@@ lic@@ k above .
For their own fun@@ eral , more and more French people choose the creation , rather than in@@ hum@@ ation : 53 % according to a I@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people , instead of 47 % .
For the fun@@ eral of a close , the opposite is the case : the French prefer in@@ hum@@ ation ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the creation .
In his book La Mor@@ t ash , Dam@@ en Le Gu@@ ay , philosop@@ her and deputy of the National Committee of E@@ th@@ ics E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &quot; violence &quot; represented by the creation , for the survi@@ v@@ ors .
There is , with the creation , &quot; violence made to the loved body &quot; , which will be &quot; reduced to a lot of ash &quot; in a very short time , and not after a process of dec@@ ay , which would &quot; accompany the stages of the m@@ our@@ ning &quot; .
There is also &quot; symbolic violence &quot; , which is due to the &quot; er@@ ron@@ eous character &quot; and the distinc@@ tive signs &quot; reduced to the &quot; an@@ onym@@ ity &quot; of the ash .
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in certain Scandinavian and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts , has not lived through in France ?
&quot; Because the cre@@ ation is a new fact &quot; , responds Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ é@@ dé@@ ri@@ que B@@ ac@@ é , president of the The@@ an@@ at@@ ology Society and author of the book Ap@@ pri@@ vo@@ ise death .
It is only tolerated since 196@@ 3 by the Catholic Church , which limited the attempts to learn it .
R@@ emo@@ ving the cre@@ ation is for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mi@@ ha@@ d-@@ N@@ ér@@ ard , Man@@ aging Director of the fun@@ eral service Service of the City of Paris , planning for the dec@@ e@@ ased ceremony as worthy as the one he would have with an in@@ com@@ ation .
The annual investigation of I@@ p@@ so@@ s shows a very strong att@@ achment to the organization of the ceremony .
77 % of French people want one , for their families , be it religious ( 53 % ) , or civil ( 24 % ) .
From now on , 73 % of people who chose a creation want a ceremony .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s want it as well .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ a adapted to this evolution of society .
&quot; For ten years , they &apos;@@ re trying to avoid families from waiting for violence , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the surrender of the ash . &quot;
70 % of the establishments now offer ma@@ sters of cere@@ monies , who do , in the presence of the body , at the following rit@@ ual : welcome the assembly , name the dec@@ e@@ ased , link it to others , raise it , give meaning to his death , organize a f@@ are@@ well .
This is the case with Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ ise &apos;s cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um since 1998 .
The ceremony ma@@ sters are often people who have converted themselves .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of Fa@@ ther L@@ ach@@ ise is organising , since 2010 , the day of La T@@ ous@@ s@@ ain@@ t , several cere@@ monies of memory , secular and non-@@ religious , to which he inv@@ ites the families of people who have been created in the year .
For the second con@@ secu@@ tive year , one of these cere@@ mon@@ ial cere@@ monies is transmitted to the attention of those who won &apos;t be able to travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um allowed us to rela@@ x it .
At La Se@@ ine , re@@ housing because of r@@ ats turns into controversy .
At the beginning of this week , a family left his a@@ partment back to so@@ cks on the building F@@ ru@@ acti@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 , due to the presence of r@@ ats .
Faced with the urgency of the situation , the director of the Office of the South T@@ ars of the South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at , has proposed , exceptional and temporary , to reloc@@ ate the couple and his three children in a new T@@ 4 .
But the family refuses &quot; for financial reasons &quot; and the situation is blocked .
The case took on exaggerated proportions , according to Jo@@ el Can@@ ap@@ a , the director of the office .
There have always been r@@ ats in the cities .
The proc@@ lam@@ ation company carries out two pass@@ ages per year , and also , we intervene , at our expense , at every request of the inhabitants .
We did so , since the end of last winter , 64 interventions .
The neigh@@ bor@@ hood is@@ n &apos;t left to give up , and r@@ ats don &apos;t get into the city .
For reasons of environmental protection and public health , proc@@ tis@@ ation products are four times less effective than in the past , of course , but for two r@@ ats , we &apos;@@ re not going to kill a taste .
&quot; We did not call ra@@ ats at home &quot; , defend the father of family who left his house to settle at the ho@@ tel .
We are soon without the sole and we wait for a new housing , at the same price as the old one .

The fire was ma@@ stered an hour after the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , many of whom took part .
As soon as our first fire@@ fighters arrived , they really saw the smoke .
&quot; So the al@@ arms have succeeded , because it was strengthening to attack the building because it &apos;s buildings col@@ lu@@ ded here &quot; , explained France to France , spokesman for fire@@ men in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .

Ben Gre@@ en@@ man : 10@@ th anniversary of the New York Com@@ edy F@@ es@@ v@@ al : The New Yor@@ ker
We could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand@@ ar@@ d-@@ up in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the actor v@@ ou@@ g@@ le Fr@@ ank F@@ ay , who held the role of teacher of the Pal@@ ace of the Pal@@ ace , on Bro@@ ad@@ way , started to tell jo@@ kes . At@@ t@@ acks directly in front of the public , on the tone of the convers@@ ation .
F@@ ay &apos;s innovation has continued over the years , until recently by the New York Com@@ ed@@ y F@@ es@@ v@@ al .
Cre@@ ated and super@@ vised by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ sch , the foun@@ der of the stand@@ ardi@@ zation club Car@@ ol@@ ine , the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val celebr@@ ates its tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectac@@ les presented in small clubs and big theat@@ res .
&quot; Most post@@ ers emerged in Car@@ ol@@ ines , and experienced a great success , until they became too famous to play in a club . &quot; H@@ ir@@ sch said .
We created this f@@ es@@ ti@@ val to be able to continue to work with them .
This year &apos;s event will see the participation of W@@ anda Sy@@ k@@ es , K@@ ath@@ es G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in and Bill Mah@@ er , and the presentation of &quot; St@@ anis@@ d U@@ p for Her@@ es &quot; , an evening of music and music for the benefit of the former combat@@ ants , organized in the Mad@@ ison St@@ or@@ re Gar@@ den , Among others , B@@ ru@@ ce S@@ pr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , Ro@@ ger W@@ a@@ ans and Bill Co@@ s@@ by will be present .
The f@@ es@@ ti@@ val has grown up , just like the world of the com@@ edy .
Several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s f@@ es@@ ti@@ val went through non-@@ traditional cir@@ cu@@ its , for example by setting out spectac@@ les on small TV channels , like Com@@ edy Central , F@@ X and S@@ pi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ ro@@ ll made his appearance in front of the scene in a si@@ t@@ co@@ m on a c@@ able channel ( &quot; The League &quot; on the fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ly so@@ cc@@ er g@@ as@@ ol@@ ly we@@ ary of the channel channel F@@ X@@ X ) and now has his own sk@@ et@@ ch@@ s show on Com@@ ed@@ os ) and now has his own sk@@ et@@ ch@@ s show on Com@@ ed@@ u . C@@ entr@@ al-@@ cen@@ tric .
Jen@@ ny S@@ la@@ te participated in the show &quot; S@@ atur@@ day Ni@@ gh@@ t Li@@ ve &quot; and was part of the cas@@ ing of the &quot; Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation &quot; series , but she is more famous for her series of vir@@ al vide@@ os &quot; Mar@@ c@@ el the S@@ hell the S@@ hell with S@@ hell with S@@ hell with S@@ hell with S@@ hell &quot; . I &apos;@@ m a gu@@ y . &quot;
K@@ ro@@ ll and S@@ la@@ te , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with the sing@@ ular voice ( sur@@ real pessimis@@ t An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k , an ir@@ on@@ ically defen@@ der of racial justice W. K@@ am@@ u Bel@@ l ) , are products of the Dec@@ entr@@ alized world of the American com@@ edy .
One of the main attr@@ actions of the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val this year will be an interview : David Ste@@ in@@ berg discussing with Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stand@@ ar@@ d-@@ setting com@@ edy , but he became a fa@@ it film and television director , as well as an u@@ no@@ fficial histor@@ ian of the com@@ edy .
Between 2005 and 2007 , he anim@@ ated a program on TV L@@ and that was called &quot; S@@ it D@@ ow@@ n Com@@ ed@@ ay with David Ste@@ in@@ berg &quot; .
The appointment takes place at the Ho@@ tel de V@@ ille , in the center of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
&quot; The city is definitively in the com@@ ic DNA of all the work of Lar@@ ry , &quot; said Ste@@ in@@ berg .
He told me that when he was here , sometimes he went down a ru@@ le between two buildings and said : Well , if I lose all my money , maybe I will live here .
The price of oil continues to fall and is close to $ 96 per bar@@ rel .
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday while the concerns about the importance of the stock compens@@ ates for a report showing that the electricity g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine manufacturing sector is becoming stronger .
The price of American reference to delivery in December has fallen from 14 c@@ ents to $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 per bar@@ rel at the end of the morning in Europe during the electronic exchanges on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Ex@@ change ( N@@ Y@@ ME@@ X ) .
The contract lost 39 c@@ ents Thursday , leaving it with a 5.@@ 8 % decrease in October .
The massive supply of crude oil has weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
The American Department of Energy told Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on Chinese manufacturing that arrived on Friday , showing growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China &apos;s economic recovery could continue to be refin@@ ed after growing growth to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a decrease that we had not known for two decades in the previous quarter .
G@@ raw , a reference for international crude already used by American refin@@ eries , lost 26 c@@ ents to fall at $ 10@@ 8@@ ,@@ 58 per bar@@ rel on Inter@@ -@@ Con@@ tin@@ ence Ex@@ change ( IC@@ E ) in London .
It &apos;s a question of the right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as .
A federal appeal court has rein@@ stated the T@@ ex@@ as restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week .
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in this state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will come into force .
The judgment by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that doctors who will practice I@@ V@@ G will have to have a &quot; ad@@ mitting privilege &quot; with local hospitals .
The admission privilege is the right of a doctor , under his status as a hospital member , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical center to issue a diagnosis or treatment .
Sup@@ porters of the I@@ V@@ G argue that the content of the law risks being translated into an immediate closure of one third of the state &apos;s clin@@ ics because these clin@@ ics have not managed to get this &quot; ad@@ mitting privilege &quot; for their practi@@ tioners .
In total , it would be almost 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments .
On Monday , a first instance judge had estimated on the eve of the law &apos;s entry into force that the provisions dealing with the ad@@ mitting privilege were anti@@ constitutional .
But the At@@ tor@@ ney General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it the post of Govern@@ or , asked the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to cancel the judgment of first instance that blocked the application of the law .
A P@@ len@@ ary hearing on this question is planned for January .
New Sta@@ r succeeded a return in force , side by side , with 1.3 million TV view@@ ers behind their TV position , or 5.@@ 6 % of the audience .
But was the show at the meeting ?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves at the hearings of this 10@@ th season , to face the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ e , the vil@@ la@@ in , the permission An@@ dr@@ é Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
Ab@@ out the exc@@ itement to find their fav@@ or@@ ite program , many were disappointed .
But why so much disappointment ?
No candidate seems to have really marked during this first premium .
Like every year , the first hearing broad@@ casts make a wide choice of we@@ ir@@ d sing@@ ers , for the better and sometimes for the worst .
But on T@@ wit@@ ter , we want show , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Luc@@ k@@ ily , some people found their account there .
Many of them tried New Sta@@ r , and sometimes even went to the end .
Beh@@ ind the TV scre@@ ens , successful sing@@ er s@@ ong@@ s are still there , season after season .
Others just have the ambition to make lau@@ gh .
The court blocks a decision concerning the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and control policy .
A federal appeal court on Thursday blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and sear@@ ches of the police department of New York and her file .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al of the United States ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) pointed out that the decision of the Jud@@ ge Sch@@ ee@@ ind@@ lin was suspended until the end of the call caught by the city .
The judge had decided in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and inter@@ rog@@ ate citizens .
The city has called for its conclusions and corrective prescri@@ ptions , especially a decision to allocate a contro@@ ller to help the police department to change his policy and the training program associated with him .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al heard on Tuesday the arguments about the request for suspension .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al said that the judge had to be drawn from the file because she violated the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias , partly because of a series of inter@@ views granted to the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to criticism from the court . .
The judge had decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and His@@ panic origin as part of their control and search program .
She appointed a external contro@@ ller to over@@ see the changes , especially the reform of policies , training and supervision , and she ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body cam@@ er@@ as in neigh@@ bor@@ hoods where the greatest number of controls are taking place .
In August , New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the call thrown by the city should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The tac@@ tic of control and sear@@ ches has been criticized by many civil rights activists .
This system of control and sear@@ ches has been in existence for decades in a certain form , but the number of registered checks increased spectac@@ ul@@ arly under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ berg , to reach his highest historical level in 2011 with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls that mainly related to black men and people from h@@ is@@ me . panic .
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all from minorities , and turned into collective action .
The supporters of changes in the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and sear@@ ches say that they will stop unjust practices , allow for more efficient police forces and to whom we trust , and will be able to change the way police departments use politics .
Op@@ ponents say that these changes would undermine the mor@@ ale of the police without reducing crime , would represent a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police under pressure after the police staff have been greatly reduced in the last decade .
The judge stressed that she did not put an end to control and sear@@ ches , which are constitutional , but reform the way N@@ Y@@ P@@ D is implementing its controls .
The ten@@ ants have to go to vote because each of them pay on average $ 100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the V@@ ille .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ 000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des this amount between each housing .
We are obliged to increase the rents to help us pay the new taxes .
By voting , we are sending a clear message .
We need to make things change in V@@ ille .
All the candidates told us they would attack the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay us fire@@ works at $ 100 000 , land from $ 4 million to $ 5 million in case ...
G@@ o to vote , it &apos;s the best way to express you and say that it &apos;s enough .

The four homes building , located on the 15 street in the street He@@ br@@ ert , has been the subject of three al@@ arms with the fire service .
The fire declared on the front , but on the three floor floor of the building .
France Vo@@ is@@ le , spokes@@ person for the protection service against fires in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c , specified that the rapid intervention of fire@@ men made it possible to avoid the spread of fl@@ ames to ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector of the city where the buildings are built closer .

C@@ ou@@ l@@ son used telephone ha@@ cking to check a tu@@ y@@ au
The former ed@@ itor of Ne@@ ws of the World An@@ dy C@@ ou@@ l@@ son would have used &quot; the ha@@ cking , surveillance and confrontation &quot; to try to confirm a bit@@ ch tu@@ y@@ au on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then in office , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
Pro@@ ur@@ ator An@@ drew E@@ d@@ is Q@@ C said in court of the O@@ ld B@@ ai@@ ley that Ne@@ ws of the World heard a false rum@@ or in May 2005 according to which C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ ann@@ h P@@ w@@ l@@ by , his &quot; nice special coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or &quot; .
It was pointed out to the cour@@ ty@@ ard that the newspaper asked G@@ len@@ n Mul@@ c@@ aire , a private detec@@ tive , to ha@@ ck P@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s thi@@ ef box and &quot; planting constantly in front of his door &quot; , but C@@ l@@ son also called it and gave him voice messages .
&quot; The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ ou@@ l@@ son , who is now the ed@@ itor of N@@ ot@@ W , is not the kind of man to stay in front of people &apos;s house and hoping them to surprise them , it &apos;s the kind of man to present history to people to see what they say &quot; , said . I &apos;@@ m saying it &apos;s .
He said that N@@ ot@@ W used three ways to investigate the subjects : telephone ha@@ cking , surveillance and confrontation .
The ed@@ itor is personally involved in the third .
It &apos;s obvious that he is aware of the second , surveillance , he can &apos;t be otherwise .
But what about the first ?
Is he aware of the telephone ha@@ cking ?
He says the opposite , but we say &quot; Of course if &quot; .
The rum@@ ors about a C@@ lar@@ ke link were taken first by the No@@ t@@ W office office when a source , having sexual attr@@ action toward M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by , said that they told him : &quot; D@@ on &apos;t lose your time with her , she &apos;s with Char@@ les . &quot;
A band , on which the pir@@ ated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times , was referred to the house of Mul@@ c@@ aire in August 2006 .
The investig@@ ators also found se@@ iz@@ ures on the private detec@@ tive computer that related to M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by and her s@@ ister row in a file &quot; project &quot; .
During the period when the detec@@ tive investigating her , the grand@@ parents of M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by received an@@ onymous calls where they asked them for information on her , added Mr Ed@@ it .
Meanwhile , the former re@@ porter N@@ ev@@ ille Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former re@@ porter James We@@ ath@@ er@@ up over@@ saw the surveillance of the minimum facts of M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by .
In a voice message he gave him on 18 June 2005 , C@@ ou@@ l@@ son said : &quot; I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk about at Char@@ les . &quot;
He explained that C@@ ou@@ l@@ son &apos;s involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as the former Minister of the Interior , David B@@ un@@ ke@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury heard Thursday that C@@ l@@ son confronted Mr Bl@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t about a link with a married woman while himself co-@@ defen@@ der Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ ou@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny having con@@ spir@@ ed with others to pir@@ ate phones between October 3 and 9 August 2006 .
Mul@@ tin@@ ational , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ a@@ ath@@ up have admitted to having ha@@ c@@ ked a telephone phone .
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister , in an up@@ bur@@ st of violence .
The American president was expected to receive Iraqi Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki on Friday 1 November 2013 , in search of help from the United States to fight against the strongest wave of violence for five years .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday 1 .
9@@ 64 people died in the violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 police officers and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN gives an even higher balance sheet with 9@@ 79 deaths and 1 9@@ 02 injured .
These violence is becoming more and more deadly despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , dominated by the Shi@@ ites .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people had been killed .
Two years after the withdrawal of American troops , the level of violence makes us fear a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation while neighb@@ oring Syria is in the thro@@ es of civil war .
The bombs strike markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ erals .
Men are shot in the middle of the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s about being politically margin@@ alized and being the target of unjust arrests , has promoted this violence .
On Friday , new violence killed four people in the north of Iraq , in the wake of the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars caught in north Baghdad .
A lot of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and to the Le@@ v@@ ant ( Ed@@ it ) , a group aff@@ ili@@ ated with al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a ( Sunni extremist ) , also involved in the civil war in Syria .
N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants a &quot; global war &quot; against al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a .
The violence is at the center of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At the time , the American president , elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country , drew up an up@@ setting picture of the situation .
Since he arrived in Washington Wednesday , N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki has multi@@ plied the meetings with the executive , and the elected representatives of Congress .
Thursday , he called for the international community to conduct a &quot; third world war &quot; against al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a .
The principle of increased assistance for Iraq in terms of security is supported by sen@@ ators of sen@@ ators and democrats .
But the latter also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a Shi@@ ite , as@@ signing him the partial responsibility for resum@@ ing violence by his &quot; sec@@ tarian and authoritarian politics . &quot;
They also called on Barack Obama to make N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki understand that &quot; Iran &apos;s per@@ nic@@ ious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship &quot; .
Beijing blam@@ es a U@@ y@@ an@@ men attack on the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men attack .
The Chinese internal security leader accused a group of U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur separati@@ sts from X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang on Friday to be behind the car bomb attack that made five deaths in the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men place in the center of Beijing Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V@@ s , ha@@ s@@ s@@ led the crow@@ d that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital , symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression carried out in 1989 , and took fire killing its three passengers and two pass@@ ants .
Den@@ g Ji@@ an@@ iz@@ h@@ u , a member of the political office responsible for internal security , accused the Islamic movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ an .
Many U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ speaking minority inst@@ alled in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese province into East Tur@@ ke@@ an .
For the Chinese government , this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreak of violence that is taking place there by independent claims .
&quot; The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organized and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &quot; , said M@@ en@@ g at the hon@@ or channel , P@@ ho@@ eni@@ x TV .
&quot; The group that took place behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ an &quot; , he added , he added , his words were taken up by the new China agency .
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests it is of U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also included stories filled with g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine and flag with Or@@ thodox religious en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment .
The incident made 42 injured .
The Islamic movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ an is seen as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an is thinking about contrac@@ eption , divorce and homosexu@@ ality .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has started leading a big survey around the world about how the par@@ ks manage sensitive issues like contrac@@ eption , divorce and couples trained by people of the same sex .
The survey asks participants how pri@@ ests care about gay couples and their children , and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage links .
The survey was sent in mid-@@ October at every national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , with the instructions to get as many answers as possible .
The information will be used for an important r@@ ally on the family that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is plans next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the &quot; National Ca@@ thol@@ ic Re@@ port &quot; , an independent Catholic newspaper of the United States .
A spokes@@ person for the Catholic Conference of Catholic B@@ ish@@ ops in the United States confirmed that the document was auth@@ enti@@ c and that every b@@ ish@@ ops decide how to sound par@@ is@@ is@@ ians .
In the United Kingdom , b@@ ish@@ ops have published the internet survey by asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .
DR@@ C : the army attack the last re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous of the rebels .
Un@@ reduc@@ able M@@ 23 , or some hundreds of fighters , were re@@ tren@@ ched at about 2000 me@@ ters of al@@ titude on the farm h@@ ills of Chancellor , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bu@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ om@@ b@@ a , two loc@@ alities located around 80 km north of the north . G@@ om@@ a , the capital of the North Ki@@ v@@ u province .
&quot; It has not stopped this morning , the fighting is continuing despite the night &quot; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P an inhabit@@ ant of J@@ om@@ b@@ a , joint phone at 12.@@ 30 p.m. and according to which a gir@@ l was shot by bul@@ let in the morning .
&quot; The intensity of the clashes has reduced a bit &quot; , he added , &quot; It seems that the F@@ AR@@ DC For@@ ces For@@ ces of the DR@@ C have pushed the rebels a little &quot; .
According to this witness wishing to remain an@@ onymous , the soldiers had &quot; spent the night &quot; in J@@ om@@ b@@ a before rising to the front for a &quot; operation of rac@@ ing &quot; .
We heard very clearly behind him the cre@@ ations that were fed with light weapons .
From B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , the political fi@@ ef@@ dom and the last strong place of the re@@ bel@@ lion fell on Wednesday , a journalist from the A@@ F@@ P could hear heavy arms de@@ ton@@ ations .
According to one source to the United Nations Mission for the St@@ abili@@ zation of the DR@@ C , the fighting went &quot; in a final phase &quot; , the F@@ AR@@ DC having &quot; surrounded the positions of M@@ 23 resid@@ ual positions to remove them &quot; .
Since the recovery , Friday , the clashes between the Movement of 23 M@@ ars ( M@@ ars ) and the army , Mon@@ us@@ co does not directly participate in the fighting , but it provides government troops with decisive support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several dozen soldiers , well received in am@@ muni@@ tion , went to the front line .
They were armed with k@@ al@@ ach@@ ni@@ kov and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
A little earlier , on the road leading to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the border post with Uganda , ai@@ ded soldiers char@@ ted a multi@@ fac@@ eted roc@@ ket char@@ ted on a fl@@ at tr@@ uck , nine of the F@@ AR@@ DC , in order to guarantee the fall of another gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic p@@ ill p@@ iling the positions of the M@@ oun@@ t . 23 on the h@@ ills .
Congolese president , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , called on the rebels once again to &quot; demo@@ bil@@ ise voluntarily &quot; pain to be dis@@ armed &quot; by force &quot; , but let the process of K@@ amp@@ ala open , where Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been discussing since December without results for the Now .
On the ground , the political leaders of M@@ 23 hope to reach an agreement .
&quot; We finished the talks , there &apos;s only the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ation to organize the signature &quot; , said Ro@@ ger Lu@@ m@@ ba@@ a , deputy chairman of the M@@ 23 delegation , without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
M@@ 23 was born of a mutilation , in April 2012 , former rebels , essentially T@@ ut@@ si , integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly acc@@ uses Uganda and Rwanda to support M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ig@@ i and K@@ amp@@ ala refu@@ te .
North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ soil is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mining resources .
In B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where around 5 000 people took refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN , the movement back to the DR@@ C that had started in the morning reversed in the middle day .
&quot; This morning we went back to our fields , but the soldiers told us to re@@ plic@@ ate us &quot; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ ye@@ an@@ k@@ ul@@ i , surrounded by its nine children , including one on the back .
We get the impression that sho@@ ts come closer to the people .
At the beginning of the evening , dozens of inhabitants crossed the border , some with a mat@@ tress on the head , to spend the night in Uganda .
The mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy , this stage of stage
C@@ l@@ assi@@ cs , sophisticated , popular , English or French produc@@ tions , s@@ ong and d@@ an@@ ced produc@@ tions take off .
After Bro@@ ad@@ way and London , Paris finally finds its voice .
It &apos;s a revolution : the French mu@@ si@@ cal claims to be a success story .
L@@ ong , from No@@ x de Paris to Mo@@ z@@ art the oper@@ a oper@@ a oper@@ a , most attempts would be prevented .
And the success stories like C@@ ab@@ ar@@ let or the Mis@@ si@@ es related to the hal@@ le of myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ lin in C@@ ast@@ el@@ let and S@@ age - - En@@ ter@@ ro@@ ment in Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or changed the situation .
Today , these two scenes are running the ti@@ t@@ les as successful tu@@ bes .

In Mo@@ g@@ ad@@ or , &quot; La B@@ el@@ le and Be@@ ast &quot; may be one of the success stories of the season .
On the other scenes , mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les like &quot; 17@@ 89 &quot; , &quot; the am@@ ants of the Bas@@ til@@ le &quot; and the small mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ es like &quot; Dis@@ co &quot; or &quot; Life and Times &quot; put themselves in the line of success and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , author of the reference book &quot; History of mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ aries &quot; and conf@@ er on the theat@@ re of Ch@@ â@@ t@@ el@@ let , analy@@ zes the reasons for the hard-@@ won success .
How do French mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ aries develop ?
The offer has multi@@ plied .
First there are the &quot; mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les &quot; that evolve as producers ...
Some use - nice projec@@ tions of images and a real story like in 17@@ 89 , the A@@ man@@ ts of the Bas@@ til@@ le .
Others make a leap of fifteen years back on the pretext that we can serve almost - anything when we have Mat@@ t - Po@@ k@@ ora in front of the post@@ er .
Then we have mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edi@@ ans with the s@@ om@@ p@@ ous produc@@ tions of Cha@@ st@@ el@@ let that make us reli@@ ve the golden age of Bro@@ ad@@ way and discover the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ d@@ he@@ im , the biggest living com@@ pos@@ er .

The independent French producers are trying a - let &apos;s go by way .
But ongoing projects like &quot; R@@ ent &quot; , &quot; The Be@@ er of the woman Ar@@ med &quot; or &quot; Le A@@ ve@@ il of the - spring &quot; has trouble being financed .
Do we have enough artists capable like Bro@@ ad@@ way as a sing@@ er , playing and d@@ ance ?
In Paris , when there are eight mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les in a season , it &apos;s a big year .
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects .
In the United States , cra@@ dle of the mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ edy , it &apos;s very different .
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools .
There are many jobs between regional theat@@ res , tour , Bro@@ ad@@ way , off@@ -B@@ ros@@ pa@@ w@@ ay ...
The tal@@ e of talent is as consistent as the number of positions to be filled .
Why do the prov@@ in@@ cial people have so much success ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor relation of culture in France .
Fe@@ w theat@@ re parts leave in tour and it is often the - theat@@ re of b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard for adults and not for young adults .
mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les plu@@ g this - lack .
These same young people like tele@@ reality and what it produces as ep@@ hem@@ eral st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful young men ( often tal@@ ented ) in front of post@@ ers of a mu@@ si@@ cal show , it is the insurance of these young girls and often of their entire family .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these spectac@@ les are so@@ rely sup@@ pressed by professionals who answer questions .
These spectac@@ les are very expected when they arrive in a province of province .

A driver &apos;s car has been lost by a gh@@ o@@ st driver , who is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed by him .
The ring was closed until 9 : 00 , where the accident was , the time that the road is removed and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
This situation has not , however , caused a lot of traffic j@@ ams because the accident took place at the he@@ ight of the Ho@@ e@@ il@@ a@@ art exit .

DR@@ C : the army pre@@ pa@@ res a new assault
Children play on a carbon jo@@ ke that belong@@ ed to the rebels of M@@ 23 , in K@@ buses , on October 31 , 2013 , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on Friday against the last bas@@ tions of the rebels of M@@ 23 , B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The objective is to remove the M@@ 23 h@@ ills that sur@@ round B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana .
Yesterday , we took the Bu@@ in@@ a col@@ line , which over@@ shad@@ ows that of M@@ bu@@ z@@ i .
Today , M@@ bu@@ z@@ i should fall by itself .
There &apos;s only the R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i col@@ line left .
&quot; C@@ el@@ le de Chancellor is not very strategic &quot; , indicated the A@@ F@@ P Govern@@ or the Govern@@ or of North Ki@@ v@@ u , Ju@@ li@@ an Pa@@ lu@@ k@@ u .
Mr Pa@@ lu@@ k@@ u plans to go on Saturday a B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana .
Poli@@ tics and the last strong place of the re@@ bel@@ lion , this loc@@ ality is located at the Ug@@ and@@ an border , at about 80 km north of G@@ om@@ a .
It was taken on Wednesday by the armed For@@ ces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Wednesday .
Since then , a few hundred ir@@ du@@ ci@@ ble M@@ 23 , are re@@ tren@@ ched to almost 2@@ ,000 me@@ ters of al@@ titude on Chan@@ nel &apos;s h@@ ills , R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ bu@@ z@@ i , close to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and the neighb@@ or local of J@@ om@@ a .
A J@@ om@@ a , an inhabit@@ ant who had reported about fighting near Thursday during all day , said that the situation was &quot; calm since this morning &quot; .
According to him , a woman and her child were killed by the fighting before and were buried .
A gir@@ l was injured by bul@@ let , and three other people were injured , whose F@@ AR@@ DC F@@ AR@@ DC added this witness quoted by the A@@ F@@ P .
Since the recovery of fighting between F@@ AR@@ DC and rebels on October 25 , both sides have given no account of the loss of human life .
The N@@ SA re@@ vel@@ ations increase the par@@ ano@@ ia of companies with regard to state surveillance .
By a beautiful day at the end of August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter flying at low al@@ titude the British consul@@ ate in Frank@@ fur@@ t , Germany &apos;s financial capital .
On order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the German National Int@@ elli@@ gence Agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the American front post , located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explain that the B@@ f@@ V was hoping to identify the presence of listen@@ ers and that the operation gave rise to an exchange between the United States and the Foreign Ministry of Germany in Berlin .
James C@@ l@@ ap@@ er , the director of the American intelligence services , insisted again in September that the United States does not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to &quot; ste@@ al industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies for American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits &quot; .
But since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the consul@@ tant who became whis@@ tle@@ -@@ b@@ lower , started to un@@ ve@@ il his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble trea@@ sure of information about the secre@@ ts of the surveillance of the United States , European governments and business leaders don &apos;t know if you should believe the director on word .
Re@@ ports , according to which the National Security Agency has sp@@ y on the Brazilian oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as and has had access to data held by American providers of storage services in C@@ lou@@ d , especially Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have given rise to the par@@ ano@@ id more than ever . Com@@ pan@@ ies of companies with regard to state surveillance .
The re@@ vel@@ ation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s phone had been pir@@ ated , maybe even for a decade , was the last stra@@ w that broke the ca@@ me@@ l &apos;s back .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then business managers are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between American intelligence services and companies .
I think it is inconceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest .
&quot; Germany must wake up &quot; , says O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ n , president of B@@ I@@ T@@ M@@ i , who represents German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies think that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to an investigation published in July by the advice cabinet E@@ Y .
However , in all the documents un@@ ve@@ iled by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there is nothing to indicate to date that the United States has sent industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans expressed their concern about the idea that the EU does not have sufficient computer and internet capabilities and think that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States .
En@@ treprene@@ urs are skep@@ tical about this .
A deputy from the German parliament says that we should create a German Google .
I can only close my eyes and re@@ open them slowly ...
&quot; It &apos;s not the right way to do it &quot; , says H@@ ass@@ o Pl@@ at@@ ner , president of the German company company , SA@@ P .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then we should not let it die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidi@@ zed in Germany , from coal to cars , to farmers .
Everything but the IT industry .
Yet the scale and sophisticated of American sp@@ ying agencies exposed by the S@@ now@@ den re@@ vel@@ ations were a shock for some companies that thought until then that China represented the biggest risk in terms of surveillance .
A big change is happening in the cl@@ oud computer because European leaders became aware of the fact that data kept in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
According to a survey carried out by the C@@ lou@@ d Security Alliance , a professional organization , about 10 % of non-@@ American members renoun@@ ced their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cl@@ oud after re@@ vel@@ ations on the American program of data expl@@ oration P@@ ris@@ m .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &quot; Our clients are asking us a question they did not ask us a year ago : where my data are kept and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction ? &quot;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew , that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most precious secre@@ ts and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It &apos;s not surprising that there are economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There have always been .
&quot; It &apos;s a recur@@ ring theme for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion . &quot; says Kur@@ t Bo@@ ck , director general of the chemical company B@@ AS@@ F .
Americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as well as sp@@ ying them on , because it &apos;s in the national interest to defend our companies .
En@@ treprene@@ urs are generally unlikely to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place , in case it leaves an op@@ ponent advantage .
Bi@@ g companies have long been ham@@ per@@ ing the message that it is , to say the least , un@@ wise to recover a U@@ S@@ B key at a professional room or to leave a lap@@ top computer without surveillance in a ho@@ tel room .
U@@ l@@ ich H@@ ack@@ enberg , a member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Aud@@ i , says that collecting mobile phones before council meetings , so that they cannot be used as a distance e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping devices , is a common practice for years .
Germany &apos;s B@@ F@@ V advis@@ es its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones pre@@ paid during their tri@@ ps abroad because of the risk of damage to the smar@@ t@@ phone .
High@@ -@@ paid mobile phones are then thrown away .
However , we fear that small and medium-sized companies are still vulnerable to pir@@ ating and monitoring .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&quot; SMEs often lack experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access &quot; , warn the B@@ f@@ V in a report .
The United States al@@ er@@ ts their own companies on the economic es@@ pion@@ age activities carried out by other countries .
The National Int@@ elli@@ gence E@@ sti@@ m@@ ate ( N@@ I@@ E ) carried out in February by the United States , cited France , as well as Russia and Israel , guilty second to having carried out acts of ha@@ cking of economic intelligence , behind China , according to The Washington Po@@ st .
A member of the board of a re@@ now@@ ned German company thought that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst &quot; .
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ quar@@ cin@@ i , former French director of the French Internal Int@@ elli@@ gence , the D@@ C@@ R@@ I , said in an interview this month : &quot; The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they collaborate in the fight against terrorism , sp@@ y on their allies . &quot;
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia , who died in unusual circumstances , think that their son was killed .
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er of Georgia , whose body was found in a ru@@ g struggle in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se of his high school , think that their son was killed , declared the family lawyer Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , de Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on 11 January stuck in a car@@ pet that supported behind the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se &apos;s gra@@ d@@ d@@ ins from his high school .
The sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff investig@@ ators in L@@ ow@@ n@@ des concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son had died in unusual circumstances , but the family of the young bo@@ y of 17 years old challenges these conclusions .
&quot; They &apos;@@ re absolutely certain that their son was killed &quot; , said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ p , the lawyer representative Ken@@ ne@@ th and Joh@@ n@@ son , on Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
They never thought that he was dead as is indicated in the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff conclusions .
&quot; They think it challenges any logic , the laws of physi@@ cs and common sense &quot; added C@@ ru@@ p .
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the or those responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; They sent their son to school with a car@@ table and they returned to a mor@@ tu@@ ary ba@@ g &quot; , he added .
The US public prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore said Thursday that he was carrying out an official investigation into the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , pointing out that several important questions remained un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is her death the result of a criminal act ?
Mo@@ ore expressed itself at a press conference Thursday afternoon .
I &apos;@@ m going to follow up the facts , wherever they lead .
My objective is to discover the truth .
&quot; I consider that there is a sufficient basis &quot; to open an official investigation , he said .
M@@ ore told journalists that the first au@@ top@@ sy indicated that Joh@@ n@@ son had died by &quot; posi@@ tional as@@ phy@@ x@@ ia . &quot;
However , a second au@@ top@@ sy has identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&quot; Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation &quot; , he said .
Mo@@ ore added that if it un@@ ites elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation on the death of Joh@@ n@@ son , he will ask the F@@ B@@ I to lead it .
The representative of the office of the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of the coun@@ ty of L@@ ow@@ n@@ des was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him Thursday .
A South Georgia judge ordered Wednesday to the authorities to submit all the vide@@ o@@ surveillance records that the investig@@ ators had examined .
The parents of the teen@@ ag@@ er said they hope that video images contain clu@@ es about the circumstances of his death .
The CD@@ C publ@@ ishes advice on aller@@ gies in children for schools .
Wednesday , the American Centre for Dis@@ ease Control and Prevention has published a series of directives showing how to manage children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
This is the first series of guidelines that the American government publ@@ ishes , since the number of children in school age suffering from food aller@@ gies has so@@ ared .
One out of 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food all@@ ergy .
The CD@@ C discovered that the pre@@ valence of food aller@@ gies in children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools about how to raise the level of prof@@ essor and food aller@@ gies for children , and how to treat them in the event of aller@@ gic reaction .
It also recommends the schools to have a stock of trick@@ i@@ ine – the brand self-@@ injec@@ tor E@@ pi@@ P@@ en being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the case of potentially deadly an@@ ap@@ i@@ la@@ x@@ y .
The legislative assemb@@ lies of states have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily the trick@@ ine in stock .
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms provided by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
Children can say , &quot; I get the impression that something makes me feel the language &quot; , &quot; I feel like having a ha@@ ir on the language &quot; or &quot; I have pi@@ pes on the language &quot; .
The N@@ SA affair highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence .
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which on one side is off@@ ended in public by sum@@ mon@@ ing the United States ambassador on 21 October , and the other banned over@@ flying by the Boli@@ el presidential plane , on the basis of the rum@@ or of the presence on his board Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de phone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent F@@ abil@@ us calls the United States ambassador , they react to a real discovery , which is the size of the American surveillance of all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in Le Mon@@ de &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns a few weeks from now on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspon@@ dence and on the other hand a sentence of the ta@@ ps of the Qu@@ ai d &apos;@@ Or@@ sa@@ y by the N@@ SA ?
Is there not a wave of hypocrisy on your part ?
journ@@ alistic approach is not a moral position , but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks takes the ve@@ il about the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world , we do indeed consider that , compared to American power , it &apos;s an important lighting .
When we describe American inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it &apos;s by no means to outra@@ ge us with this practice , it &apos;s to describe the world as it is .
Has France benefited from information provided by the N@@ SA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration ?
The establishment of ten years of very powerful technological tools by the United States , but also by France , was officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Also , in this area , France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal zones in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sh@@ ah was reported to the French thanks to the N@@ SA means .
France can be led , for example , to trans@@ mit entire data blocks on the Sa@@ hel region to American services , and in return - as we already said quickly - Americans can give information to the French people in other parts of the world .
So the fundamental question behind this N@@ SA affair is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with inter@@ c@@ eption tools , that the question of the total lack of prior debate , especially in the parliament , on the justification of such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be the@@ irs , and in the end . , the question of violations of liberties .
What is the real risk for the United States ? A deterioration in their image ?
We can all denounce them , I don &apos;t see how they can be punished .
The risk that the Americans run may be double .
The first is when their allies - and it was the case recently - learned that their leaders , sometimes at the top of their state , have been watched .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have stra@@ ined .
Another effect may be more econom@@ ical : more and more European or South American companies are bal@@ king , in the light of the re@@ vel@@ ations , to give their confidential data to American providers subject to American laws , and therefore to the takeover of the N@@ SA .
Last point : the wide movement of re@@ vel@@ ations committed by media from all over the world , which helps to initiate a debate on the monitoring practices of intelligence services so almost non-existent , could encourage legislators , including Americans , to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services .
Pa@@ rents of inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized children can choose &quot; un@@ defined sex &quot; .
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sexual bodies .
The male or female of the new born will no longer be awarded them in a rigid way at birth .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children , allow them to register a sex &quot; invol@@ un@@ tary &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on his birth certificate .
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could take ha@@ sty decisions about sexual re@@ as@@ sign@@ ment sur@@ ger@@ y for their babies , and to fight against discrimination against inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ated people .
According to the B@@ BC , an inter@@ sex@@ u@@ é person would have said years later , &quot; I &apos;@@ m neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
I &apos;@@ m going to stay the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , con@@ tu@@ si@@ es and bal@@ af@@ fr@@ é .
It is estimated that one out of 2 000 born every year is neither a gu@@ y nor a gir@@ l .
They are inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized , inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality is part of the group of the 60 diagno@@ s@@ tics diagno@@ sed as disorder of sexual development , a generic term referring to people with ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es or blo@@ gs ( o@@ v@@ ar or tes@@ ticul@@ ar ) or sexual bodies ab@@ normally developed . .
Di@@ ana S@@ imp@@ son could have been inter@@ sex@@ ually inter@@ sex@@ ted .
S@@ ex@@ ual identi@@ fi@@ er is still not understood , but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be defined , it is better to use the best available information to give it , then wait and follow the child &apos;s physical and physical development before considering a sur@@ gical , if necessary .
D@@ r@@ ack J@@ ack D@@ res@@ cher , psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and speci@@ alist in sexual identi@@ fi@@ er , said that the new German law &quot; seems to be a good idea &quot; .
Inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized children pose an ethical dilemma .
&quot; Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require sur@@ ger@@ y , but this is@@ n &apos;t the case for most children , &quot; he added .
It is possible to make a sexual as@@ sign@@ ation without operation , and see how identity develops .
The science of knowing how a child will develop sexual identity is not very precise .
Nobody can answer the question of why it happens .
It &apos;s like the myster@@ y surrounding homosexual people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described people inter@@ sex@@ u@@ alized as different from trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender people , since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution , which is neither man nor exclusively that of a woman , but is usually both at the same time . and not clearly defined as one or the other .
These features may be manife@@ sted themselves in the secondary sexual character , ( like the mus@@ cul@@ ar mass , the p@@ ilo@@ ting , the ch@@ ick@@ ens and the stat@@ ure ) , the primary sexual character ( like re@@ producing bodies and sexual bodies ) or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es and hormones .
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex@@ ually and trans@@ gender people in the field of employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
Young girls of a non-@@ compli@@ ant gender now have camps that are especially destined for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register gender , femin@@ ine or &quot; third sex &quot; on their official documents .
In June , an 2@@ 2-@@ year-old Australia , Nor@@ e May@@ -@@ W@@ el@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been &quot; neutral &quot; after having won his appeal trial that auth@@ oriz@@ es him to keep a sex &quot; un@@ specified &quot; for life .
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F - X for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ é , according to the Ministry of the Interior .
In neighb@@ oring France , gender issues are still the subject of controversy , according to a report broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of legislators in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition so that the &quot; gender theory &quot; is removed from school books .
The American site Ca@@ thol@@ ic also opposed the German law , writing that &quot; since the world is dragging on in a new rule where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one , two other pillars of civilisation . &quot;
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of a baby also said on B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to be awarded to babies for their birth .
&quot; The role of parent is sufficiently stres@@ s@@ ful without additional restrictions , especially if you don &apos;t know the sex of your child &quot; , she said on the site for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sexual bodies were called Her@@ m@@ ap@@ ro@@ d@@ ite , according to the name of the beautiful Greek go@@ d who had a dual sex .
And barely a dozen years ago , the medical community considered the gender an ar@@ du@@ es , which can be er@@ ased and on which we can re@@ design .
But now , many people question the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can wrong , don &apos;t know how a child will feel sexual re@@ as@@ sign@@ ment when it increases .
&quot; In the middle of the 20th century , we called this an emergency psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency &quot; , said D@@ res@@ cher .
When these children were born , we di@@ dn &apos;t call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , we phone the sur@@ ge@@ on .
The dominant theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual bodies was launched by D@@ r@@ . John Mon@@ ey , university Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins , who considered the gender to be m@@ alle@@ able .
He devoted the term &quot; sexual identity &quot; and supported that social and environmental signals - how parents bring up a child - inter@@ act with a child &apos;s genes and hormones to design him so that he is identified as male or female .
But in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as &quot; John / Jo@@ an &quot; , his the@@ ories gave rise to controversy .
He advised the parents of a little bo@@ y whose pen@@ s had been cut off during a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to do it completely , also taking him away from the tes@@ ticul@@ ar , and raising him like a gir@@ l .
&quot; Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transition case , but it was not the case &quot; , said D@@ res@@ cher .
At the age of 15 , he became a bo@@ y again and married with a woman .
But 38 years old , he committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ cher said that some doctors &quot; always &quot; repeat this model &quot; .
But in the 1990 &apos;s , with the arrival of the internet , those who lived through these sex change operations say &quot; they &apos;@@ re not satisfied with the result . &quot;
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 3@@ 3@@ -year old writ@@ er from Mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with male ch@@ ro@@ s@@ ms X@@ Y but from ambiguous sexual bodies .
Do@@ c@@ tors could not really say if he had a large c@@ lic@@ h@@ é or a small pen@@ s and were convinced that he could never have a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
So soon after its birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered a sur@@ ger@@ y from the external body and tes@@ ticul@@ ar and was raised like a gir@@ l .
They were made to take femin@@ ine hormones at the age of 12 .
&quot; I knew I was not a gir@@ l , &quot; he said on A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 , he en@@ du@@ red a v@@ ag@@ in@@ l@@ as@@ hi@@ e .
But de@@ pressed and realized that something was wrong , he asked for his medical file .
What he discovered horri@@ fied .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth - and no one ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a sexual development mess ( D@@ D@@ S ) that prevented his body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one so that his sexual bodies could develop .
Having learned the truth , he has become a man again , following a treatment of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one and getting rid of her brea@@ sts .
The sur@@ ger@@ y made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he defends the cause of others in an organization called Inter@@ face Inter@@ face , which tries to norm@@ alize the perception of inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ is , Man@@ aging Director of the non-@@ profit organization based in California Ad@@ voc@@ ate for In@@ formal C@@ ho@@ ice , fears that the German law &quot; inv@@ ites labelling and stig@@ ma@@ tisation . &quot;
&quot; Many activists worry that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their child a &quot; invol@@ un@@ tary &quot; sex &quot; , she said .
We are afraid that she will encourage interventions .
We think it would be better to at@@ tribute a male or female sex , and wait .
But we di@@ dn &apos;t see what the law would give , so we can only put forward hypo@@ thes@@ es .
Ta@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ is has said that his organization supports Australia &apos;s law because &quot; it auth@@ oriz@@ es adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex &quot; .
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind &quot; , she added .
The German law concerns the award of sex at birth .
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age .
When they grow , they will be able to take decisions about their own body .
But D@@ r@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , radi@@ olog@@ ists speci@@ alized in ma@@ m@@ mo@@ graph@@ s in Pit@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , whose daughter is affected by a sexual development mess and who helps thousands of people in a support group , said that the German law &quot; will take responsibility &quot; the parents and the Children .
The daughter of D@@ r@@ at@@ z , K@@ diplomacy , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es , but suffers from a D@@ D@@ S called D@@ D@@ S , which is completely in@@ sensitive to an@@ dro@@ gen .
Because of the failure of his an@@ dro@@ gen rec@@ ep@@ tors , K@@ diplomacy developed femin@@ ine tra@@ its .
She has a v@@ ag@@ in , but not a pi@@ e or o@@ v@@ ar .
Today , 29 years old , K@@ diplomacy is married and internal to inf@@ ant psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at the University of Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania .
Although it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or be@@ ating mothers .
&quot; The law leaves a certain la@@ titude to parents so that they don &apos;t have to take ha@@ sty decisions &quot; , said Bar@@ at@@ z .
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them , and a deadline before including &quot; male &quot; or &quot; femin@@ ine &quot; .
So , everything goes well - you can raise your child and love it .
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parent .
You don &apos;t need to rush for a sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
&quot; This puts children at the heart of the decision and dil@@ utes the feeling of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they &apos;@@ re afraid of not doing what you need , &quot; she said .
Finally , the child will decide with which sex he / she feels the most comfortable / most comfortable - and it &apos;s something ama@@ zing .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .

In an interview with the daily La Sta@@ mp@@ a , the center leader says &quot; firmly the intention &quot; to continue governing with his coalition until the next general elections in 2015 .
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet during this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted for tax evasion in August .

Report : The Obama campaign considered to be leaving B@@ id@@ en for H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton
President Barack Obama &apos;s closest advisers have planned , in the greatest secret , to replace V@@ ice President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en by H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most significant event that appears in the very waiting book of Mar@@ k H@@ al@@ per@@ in &apos;s 2012 campaign and John He@@ il@@ le@@ mann , &quot; D@@ ow@@ n : G@@ o Ch@@ ange 2012 &quot; .
The Times got a copy of the book to appear and told Thursday night that the president &apos;s close collabor@@ ators had conducted &quot; thorough work in groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011 &quot; to see if the ev@@ ic@@ tion of B@@ id@@ en could help Obama with a view to re-@@ election while his hopes d@@ run@@ k .
According to the political correspon@@ dent of Times J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the high officials of the campaign and of the White House , namely former Secretary General of the White House Bill D@@ e@@ y , aiming to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by the former Secretary of State could have on the ballot .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that was fier@@ cely guar@@ ded in Chic@@ ago &apos;s Cam@@ pai@@ gn of Chic@@ ago and inside the O@@ v@@ ale Bureau .
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – especially D@@ e@@ ep , the former president of Obama ’ s campaign leader J@@ im Mess@@ ina and the former coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors in the White House David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David P@@ lou@@ ff@@ e – knew that the change was under consideration .
&quot; D@@ own D@@ own &quot; says that D@@ e@@ y led the charge to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their &quot; close personal links &quot; , before finally deciding against change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list &quot; doesn &apos;t clearly improve Obama &apos;s chances of success . &quot;
In an interview with Martin , D@@ e@@ y confirmed that the administration had indeed planned to replace B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
&quot; I said that I had looked at a whole series of questions , and it was one of them &quot; , said D@@ e@@ al@@ y in the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that at that time , the president was not in shape , so we were told , &quot; Lord , what can we do ? &quot;
While De@@ e@@ y called the &quot; concer@@ t@@ é &quot; examination , Martin indicated at Ander@@ son Co@@ op@@ er of C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested a lot to discover if change would be beneficial during the ballot .
&quot; The countryside does not spend a lot of money on surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking measures &quot; said Martin on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
However , we don &apos;t know if Obama was aware that his team was considering replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N that he asked D@@ e@@ y if his bos@@ s was aware of the possible res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le .
Although D@@ e@@ y said he did not think the president did not think &quot; knew &quot; about possible change , the former Secretary General admitted that he was &quot; possible &quot; that Obama knew .
Martin added that &quot; D@@ ow@@ n &quot; did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls arrived on the Obama office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the ou@@ ster of B@@ id@@ en from the presidential list was examined .
&quot; Maybe &quot; , &quot; replied &quot; .
Do you want a flu@@ o ice ?
A British entreprene@@ ur created the first flu@@ or@@ res@@ c@@ en@@ te ice in the world .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has benefited from the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of this marine animal to develop a lu@@ min@@ es@@ cent col@@ lation .
He had the idea after reading a study on the m@@ ou@@ ths and convinced Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate the brilliant protein .
The ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the language by increasing the P@@ H of the protein to make it sh@@ it .
Ch@@ ris explains that , since the cre@@ am cre@@ am is starting to read when she responds to the heat of the mouth , the more we leave , the more brilliant it becomes .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the sli@@ de society &quot; L@@ ick M@@ e m &quot; , said : &quot; It &apos;s something ama@@ zing , but we &apos;@@ re still only in the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of this thing costs about £ 200 . &quot;
The protein we use in the ice re@@ acts with the neutral p@@ H language .
So when your mouth is heating up the protein , the level of p@@ H increases and the ice starts to sh@@ it .
We tried it in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of H@@ all@@ we@@ en because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
It &apos;s probably the most expensive ice I created because the bad gu@@ ys are worth four times more expensive than gold .
So every boom costs me about £ 14@@ 0@@ m .
But it &apos;s pretty good taste !
The company with Char@@ lie &apos;s experimental approach , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual gl@@ ac@@ ial fra@@ gr@@ ances such as beer , che@@ ese , beef and the golden lea@@ f .
But its next creation is becoming even more ambitious .
He added : &quot; I would really like to develop an in@@ visible ice . &quot;
It &apos;s intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the cur@@ se caused by ic@@ y cr@@ è@@ ches that are the ice cre@@ am , but I think I &apos;@@ ll find a way to do it .
The ice uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the me@@ du@@ se syn@@ the@@ ti@@ fied by Chinese scientists .

H@@ all@@ a@@ we@@ ed 2013 : In figures
When I was small , H@@ all@@ we@@ en was magic .
My s@@ ister and me were allowed to eat swee@@ ts , go to sle@@ ep late and disgu@@ ise us to go to the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
Today , I &apos;@@ ve become more p@@ ing@@ y .
In the last two years , I have not distributed one single good and I will certainly not do it any more this year .
But the intern@@ ships show that I &apos;@@ m the black sheep when we talk about H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
The majority of Americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - celebrate H@@ al@@ we@@ en this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 per good bon@@ us , disgu@@ sting and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to the National R@@ et@@ ail F@@ eder@@ ation .
What I &apos;@@ m looking forward to at every party of H@@ all@@ we@@ en is the tendencies .
The disgu@@ ise should represent $ 1.2 of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , in@@ anim@@ ated ex@@ tor@@ tion@@ ate objects are fu@@ n .
Women no longer need to be sex@@ y professionals ; they can also be sex@@ y food like p@@ iz@@ z@@ as , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As for men , I expect to see many z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , thanks to the TV series The Wal@@ king De@@ ad series , and I be@@ t that the men in the S@@ of@@ t P@@ un@@ k area will be among our photo@@ s In@@ st@@ gra@@ m this year .
According to Google , the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after disgu@@ sts are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates and wit@@ ches .
I suppose there &apos;s no harm in staying traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my aston@@ ishment , they were not the only ones .
In fact , Americans will spend $ 3@@ 30 M on animals this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
It makes many curious dogs disgu@@ ised in h@@ ot@@ dog@@ s .
When it is a question of swee@@ ts , we don &apos;t sle@@ ep .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 in swee@@ ts this year , according to the cabinet Ni@@ el@@ sen .
This represents about 27@@ 2 million k@@ g of Her@@ sh@@ ey , sugar , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ l@@ ers and C@@ lar@@ k b@@ ars .
It &apos;s a great news for the 41 million children who go to the hun@@ t for swee@@ ts in their neigh@@ bor@@ hood , according to the American Department of Comm@@ er@@ ce .
In fact , we are going to buy and , don &apos;t tell us stories , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate during H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
cor@@ n swee@@ ts are the only thing we do not want to eat ; and yet almost 16 million k@@ g are sold for H@@ all@@ we@@ en , according to the National Con@@ f@@ ric@@ tion Association .
This represents about 9 billion cor@@ n gra@@ ins .
It &apos;s a myster@@ y that I have not yet managed to clarify .
Nothing is more representative of H@@ all@@ we@@ en than the houses ha@@ iled .
They wear the best names , like &quot; Ter@@ ro@@ r Be@@ h@@ d the Wil@@ s &quot; ( which is actually a real prison ) , &quot; H@@ ow@@ -@@ O@@ -@@ S@@ c@@ re@@ am &quot; and &quot; The House of Sh@@ uck . &quot;
In fact , there are 1 200 H@@ an@@ ded houses officially recognised in the United States , which generates around 500 M of reci@@ pes , according to the Americ@@ as . U@@ p@@ per , and it includes these wonderful photo@@ s of you on that that your friends put on Fac@@ e@@ book and you can &apos;t take away from it . and on which a type that you like well leave a comment on the &quot; nice head &quot; style .
Finally , let &apos;s talk about cement .
Char@@ lie G@@ ro@@ se presented to us La G@@ ro@@ se C@@ ro@@ ille when we were a k@@ id , and s@@ cul@@ p@@ ting a c@@ é@@ ro@@ ille in the form of laun@@ ter@@ ne , it &apos;s like dec@@ or@@ ating a Christmas tre@@ e . It &apos;s something we &apos;@@ re doing since we &apos;@@ ve been a little small .
Luc@@ k@@ ily for us , the &quot; B@@ é@@ -@@ ic@@ ill@@ ille trend &quot; started only last year thanks to P@@ inter@@ is , so most of us have s@@ cul@@ p@@ ted these po@@ ti@@ ons and have not had to sit in it .
This year , Americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 M in ci@@ ro@@ ls , according to the U@@ .@@ S@@ . C@@ en@@ sus Bureau .
The cement workers who f@@ low@@ ed slowly on your house &apos;s por@@ e were probably coming from Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 5@@ 42 million cement ro@@ cks were grown this year .
If you try to make you more notic@@ eable , call Ti@@ m and S@@ us@@ an M@@ ath@@ is@@ don in N@@ ap@@ a , in California , and try to s@@ cra@@ p their c@@ as of 9@@ 22 k@@ g .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scot@@ land will create an ab@@ ate@@ ment structure internally ( &quot; bad bank &quot; ) grou@@ ping £ 38 billion ( 45 billion euros ) of the most risky assets , measure to rela@@ x its relations with London and speed up its re@@ privatization .
The bank wants to reduce from 55 % to 70 % the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet in the next two years and hopes to clean it completely within three years .
R@@ B@@ S also said that it would include a pro@@ vision for depreci@@ ation of the additional dubious debts of £ 4 to 4@@ .5 billion in the quarter , a writing linked to the constitution of the can@@ t@@ oning structure .
R@@ B@@ S also specified that this internal restructuring would release from £ 10 to 11 billion capital p@@ ounds , thereby strengthening its lending ability .
The bank and London stressed that the &quot; bad bank &quot; would make it possible to draw a line from the past , with the government in particular being accused of interference in the management of R@@ B@@ S .
&quot; We can now move forward , worry about the future and the 90 % of the assets that are a really good bank and build a big bank for cli@@ en@@ te@@ le and for the United Kingdom &quot; , said the new director General Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan to the press .
L@@ and R@@ over announ@@ ces his spons@@ oring of a series of ra@@ ys .
The inter@@ ior has a low seat seat and seat bel@@ ts har@@ n@@ ly 6 points , as well as an Inter@@ co@@ m system .
Among the options , including improved bra@@ kes , a service providing access to mechan@@ ics from Bo@@ ler Wor@@ ks , log@@ istic support and the storage of the vehicle between two events .
D@@ re@@ w Bo@@ ler , the managing director of Bo@@ ler M@@ ot@@ or@@ port said : &quot; The am@@ ate@@ urs of ra@@ il@@ es who join Bo@@ ler have changed . &quot;

The fire@@ men were called to rescue a ha@@ ot lost after staying stuck at 15 m above the ground on an unstable cor@@ ni@@ he in a career
Ru@@ by , a wrec@@ k co@@ ker , escap@@ ed after a traffic accident without gravity .
She was found three days later by someone who promoted his dog in his career .
The fire@@ men took to recall the c@@ lif@@ f during the c@@ lif@@ f to recover the chic@@ ken and save it from a certain death .
A chic@@ ken had the chance to escape the worst after the fire@@ men were called to recover him in safety while he was lost at 15 m above the ground on the unstable season of a c@@ lif@@ f .
Ru@@ by , a 9 months co@@ ker car , escap@@ ed after a road accident Sunday afternoon and lived for three days alone before being saved in a career Wednesday .
His owners , Scot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years old , and his little friend B@@ ec@@ ky H@@ all , 20 years old went to the career of F@@ l@@ ap@@ brea@@ sts in D@@ en@@ ol@@ me , in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to find Ru@@ by and thank the fire and emergency service W@@ est Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
They had desperately sought their lost chi@@ ps and launched a call on social network sites after she disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity .
T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ .@@ 15 Wednesday , a person with an acute view who promoted his dog re@@ ne@@ ged Ru@@ by on a cor@@ ni@@ he in the career , stuck at 15 m above the ground .
A technical rescue team of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade de C@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on rush@@ ed to the scene and went down as a reminder to save Ru@@ by by using a civili@@ zation for animals to transport it until the c@@ up of the c@@ lif@@ f .
The technical emergency specialist An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton said : &quot; She was in a precarious situation . &quot;
She was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , at 15 m of the summit and 15 m from the ground .
She di@@ dn &apos;t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen .
But it &apos;s right now .
She e@@ aten b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
It was a very unusual call .
It &apos;s incredible that someone noticed the dog .
The technical emergency specialist Peter L@@ u said : &quot; Ru@@ by has had a lot of luck with it un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed . &quot;
She could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by was led by the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for a control ; his general state was satisfactory , apart from exha@@ u@@ sting and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
M@@ iss H@@ all , from H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in the West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : &quot; I was terri@@ fied by looking at the emergency . &quot;
I di@@ dn &apos;t think it was up to me first .
It was surprising to have him again in his arms .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian said that if she had been too exhausted and she had van@@ ished , she would probably have fallen .
The fire@@ men have been wrec@@ ked .
What they did was really courageous .
We are so grateful to them , each of them has been absolutely wonderful .
Mr Al@@ der@@ son , from K@@ ei@@ gh@@ ley , added : &quot; We &apos;@@ re sc@@ ared that she fell but she di@@ dn &apos;t move . &quot;
The fire@@ men were sup@@ er .
I can &apos;t believe that she was there .
M@@ ick J@@ ag@@ ger says he never dre@@ am@@ ed K@@ at@@ y Per@@ ry when she was 18 .
During an interview during a Australia radio show this week , the po@@ p star said she was a ch@@ or@@ ist on the s@@ ong of J@@ ag@@ ger &quot; O@@ ld H@@ abi@@ ts &quot; in 2004 .
Per@@ ry said having din@@ ner with the ro@@ ter@@ an of ro@@ ck and explained , &quot; he dra@@ ined me when I was 18 years old . &quot;
She added , &quot; It was a long time ago , and it was very nice . &quot;
In a statement Thursday , a representative of J@@ ag@@ ger , 70 years old , said he &quot; outright den@@ ies K@@ at@@ y Per@@ ry advance advance &quot; .
The representative added : &quot; Maybe she conf@@ uses him with someone else . &quot;
Per@@ ry was one of the lucky ones to make an appearance during the R@@ ol@@ ling St@@ art this year .

Beijing puts into question a Turk@@ men Islamic movement .
&quot; back@@ room support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ at@@ an based in Central and Western Asia &quot; , declared the bos@@ s of the Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong TV channel , according to a video online on Thursday night on a website .
M@@ en@@ g Ji@@ an@@ iz@@ h@@ u , who is a member of the political office of the Chinese Communist Party ( CC@@ P ) , spoke to T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent during an official visit to Uzbekistan .
It &apos;s the first time that a Chinese official has named a particular organization after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs of a same family of the same family of X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , a border region of the X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang region , have preci@@ pit@@ ated their g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine car against the entry of the C@@ it@@ é banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that made two deaths and 40 injured .
The car driver , his wife and her mother have died in the fire of the car .
E@@ ti@@ m , which claims to fight for the independence of East Tur@@ ke@@ an , a former name of China X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , was cl@@ assed by the UN in 2002 among the organisations aff@@ ili@@ ated to al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a .
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic distur@@ ban@@ ces in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George K@@ er@@ ev@@ an : The break@@ up of Europe gives S@@ co@@ ts the choice .
Another day , another worrying story of independence .
This time , we were told that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement to be able to join the EU .
And here we hear stories of passport control at Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed son border along the H@@ ad@@ nothing wall .
While it &apos;s true that the newspaper of Stra@@ th@@ y@@ de indicated the possible economic effects of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it was not in the headlines ( and it was planned ) .
Nobody said that EU Member States spend a lot of their time circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being , a continued failure to respect rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from S@@ co@@ ts .
So it &apos;s a story that is@@ n &apos;t a story .
And a story so old that it is now fixed : I heard for the first time the b@@ ob@@ ard according to which &quot; independence means passport control &quot; more than 40 years ago .
But we for@@ got an interesting point in this interpretation of an old du@@ sty con@@ te .
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe , actually ?
Why exchange London &apos;s y@@ o@@ ke against that of Brussels , especially now ?
Here is the real news about Europe : the great post@@ war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is definitely st@@ alled .
With the euro crisis , the Europe Pro@@ ject is officially dead .
Ac@@ ross Europe , parties that oppose the EU or who milit@@ ate for leaving the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , the Euro@@ scep@@ tic Al@@ ter@@ native for Germany , based only this year and arrived from nowhere , brought together almost five million votes during the federal elections in September and lifted the Liberal Democratic Party ( equivalent of our Liberal Democrats ) from the B@@ und@@ es@@ ta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , associated with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket weigh@@ ing on the national economies by means of joining the single currency , led many people to think that the Europe Pro@@ ject went too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficit - it was only true for Greece .
Instead , the European system has made its members exchange exchange rates fav@@ orable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep .
Without the possibility of a de@@ val@@ uations of the national currency , the countries of southern Europe end up with an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany .
The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in salaries and public spending - encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems , there is a deeper un@@ ease related to productivity in Europe .
Following the &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason to subsidi@@ ze French and German companies in the energy sector at the consumer &apos;s expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States .
It &apos;s a draw@@ back in terms of costs , as we already saw in G@@ ran@@ na@@ ut .
All wage ear@@ ners in the world will not prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being pen@@ alized by a cheap American sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the revol@@ t , especially in France , is one of the EU &apos;s great leaders .
After the war , the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and to put Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy to harm themselves .
Re@@ sul@@ t : the far-@@ right party of Mar@@ ine Le Pen , the National Front National Front , just won a crucial partial election , sending the Socialists to power in the third place .
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the votes – a good warning for the British Lab@@ or Party that reminds her that he cannot assume that a split from the right will automatic the left .
What does Mar@@ ine Le Pen do with his new popularity with the French white working class ?
She wants to use next year &apos;s European elections to create a single anti-@@ currency and anti-@@ European block in the European Parliament .
If the anti-@@ European parties are good figures in these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That &apos;s what I think : very soon , the anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will uni@@ fy itself and end up killing the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will come back to something that will look more like &quot; the Europe of Nations ( sovereign@@ s ) &quot; granted by General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro , but France and southern Europe will find their own currency .
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project , and I hope it &apos;s swe@@ et eyes in the United States .
However , Washington &apos;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Great Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of the little England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending Berlin and Brussels .
I think Scotland could live with a fre@@ er European agreement provided that we keep our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-@@ federal Europe .
Otherwise , we should em@@ ul@@ ate Norway and maintain our economic independence .
Scotland &apos;s S@@ N@@ P government is - and note - the most successful anti-@@ austerity political movement in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed drastic cuts ( and implementation ) by the Labour ch@@ ess@@ lier Chancellor . and the conservative / Liberal Democratic coalition that followed .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it &apos;s to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .
E@@ arly , P@@ u@@ ber@@ é : A@@ ge@@ ing earlier
Stu@@ dies show that Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than young white girls .
physical changes do not mean that pub@@ er@@ ty is imminent .
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible .
Experts think that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
The trend towards an early pub@@ er@@ ty is not so pronounced at boys
The old C@@ N@@ N correspon@@ dent P@@ at E@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a specialist journalist in family and health issues for children .
Does a mother have to worry if the brea@@ sts and p@@ ile pu@@ ff of her gir@@ l are starting to grow at 7 or 8 years ?
At the annual conference of the American A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ics that took place this week in Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Dr Paul K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist , explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young people . American and represent a new standard .
&quot; I spend a lot of time reassuring parents . In general , it doesn &apos;t indicate a fast evolution toward full pub@@ er@@ ty &quot; , said K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
The obvious signs of development , such as the bur@@ ge@@ oning of brea@@ sts , the po@@ les under arms and in the pun@@ ch zone and body sm@@ ell , appear earlier among girls .
But there was only a small advance in the age of the first rules in the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is of 12 and a half , whereas it was 12 years old in 1970 .
&quot; Once the ch@@ est started to expand , you need at least two or three years before the first rules appear &quot; , indicated K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of &quot; E@@ ar@@ ly P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ ls : The Es@@ s@@ ential Gu@@ ide to C@@ ing with Th@@ is &quot; Pro@@ ble@@ m &quot; .
Time is the most accurate test to know how to develop the pub@@ er@@ ty .
There is a debate about what is the real appearance of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; early &quot; when the development of the ch@@ est is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows down or stops . It &apos;s something that a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ s can follow closely .
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by a en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist to remove serious problems like tu@@ m@@ ours or k@@ y@@ sts .
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences : early aging of b@@ ones that can put a bra@@ ke on growth and a small size in ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
The recommendations for medic@@ ally and hormon@@ al treatment are based on the age of the child , the development rate , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
The psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ ap@@ ow@@ it@@ z is careful with medic@@ ation but recognizes that &quot; control of pub@@ er@@ ty can reduce certain behavior problems and the sen@@ s@@ ation for young girls to be different from others &quot; .
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young girls to have their rules .
&quot; They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will manage hygiene issues &quot; , said K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
&quot; It &apos;s a shock &quot; , remember a woman whose gir@@ l had her first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules , she was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
She came back from the sc@@ ary school that was shocked to be the first one among her friends .
There are many the@@ ories brought to public knowledge about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
However , there is no coherent theory that the hormones in milk or other food , chemical products present in the environment or sexual messages convey by the media are responsible .
The boys , like girls , reach their pub@@ er@@ ty earlier .
K@@ ap@@ ow@@ it@@ z claims that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is that of the obesity epidemic .
He participated in a study on girls aged between 6 and 9 who links the percentage of mass fat at the trigger of the pub@@ er@@ ty .
Other disco@@ veries support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In this country , Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach the age of pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than young white girls .
There are various explanations .
On a global scale , the mechanism of early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to be influenced by everything , from economic conditions to climate , via the genes .
Another problem : although the boys have their own poc@@ ket on the face and in the younger pu@@ b zone , the tendency towards real , real pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pronounced as among girls .
Other doctors participating in the A@@ A@@ P conference insisted on the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ac@@ n@@ é and the po@@ goods are common , even in inf@@ ants and small ones .
&quot; We have to be careful about how we identify the real appearance of pub@@ er@@ ty &quot; , said the D@@ r@@ . L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ist working in the hospital for children Gor@@ ye@@ b to Mor@@ ris@@ t@@ down , in New Jer@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents should not hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ s to know how to talk with their children .
&quot; This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than planned &quot; , explained K@@ af@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
If you stay calm , your child will react well in general .
G@@ ir@@ ls whose pub@@ er@@ ty is early must be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected , the process is part of life .

An air of docu@@ mentary
&quot; His relationship with success is tortured , that &apos;s what was interested in us : a mix@@ ture of bad luck , a gu@@ y who is@@ n &apos;t here at the right time , who is@@ n &apos;t Car@@ ri@@ er@@ ist but integrated , with self-@@ destructive behavior &quot; , declared to the press E@@ th@@ an Co@@ en , crow@@ ned with his Fa@@ ther Jo@@ el of several O@@ sc@@ ars and prices in C@@ ann@@ es .
If L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is di@@ dn &apos;t exist , the two fil@@ m@@ makers of cra@@ zy music built their story on real person@@ alities at the time like the mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an mad D@@ a@@ ve V@@ on R@@ on@@ k .
The idea was to show the time before the rise of Green@@ w@@ ich village , this neigh@@ bor@@ hood of New York called to become &quot; the ep@@ ic@@ enter of the rise of mad music that would create international st@@ ars &quot; as the journalist E@@ li@@ j@@ ah Wal@@ d , friend of Van R@@ on@@ k , wrote .
The mo@@ vi@@ e then takes a docu@@ mentary , the du@@ d@@ ust music label inv@@ aded with 3@@ 3@@ r@@ d invented by an old secre@@ tary secre@@ tary , un@@ pay@@ able , mu@@ si@@ cal choices of the time stu@@ di@@ os and the c@@ af@@ es where the sing@@ ers were taking place .
The magic of the Co@@ en bro@@ thers still operates by integrating a fun@@ ny character of charac@@ ters who cross the mo@@ vi@@ e constantly : a beautiful c@@ at c@@ at compared to the ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft compan@@ ion of L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is .

For Justi@@ n Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke , if work is necessary to &quot; be considered good &quot; , &quot; chance can also launch someone &apos;s career &quot; and &quot; more and more today &quot; .
Like L@@ le@@ w@@ n D@@ av@@ is who refuses to compromise on his music , the po@@ p star explains that in a career , &quot; the most important thing is not to let ourselves be caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves &quot; .

The avi@@ on@@ ers qu@@ arre@@ l about the wid@@ th of seats when big orders are at stake .
The dispute is ra@@ ging between the big aviation companies about the wid@@ th of tourist class seats on long-@@ distance flights , pa@@ ving the way for a bitter confrontation during the Dub@@ ai a@@ ero@@ space room that takes place in the month .
The conflict concerns the wid@@ th of proposed seats on long-@@ distance passenger flights to economic class passengers - which are not always the most cour@@ te@@ ous by the air companies , but to which the space allocated is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the last devices presented by Airbus SA@@ S and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week Airbus has called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 chic@@ ks ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Bo@@ eing says that it should be up to the airline companies to decide .
The dispute has broken out while the avi@@ on@@ ers are trying to sell even larger versions of their long-@@ distance aircraft aircraft , possibly hoping for a order record when the event takes place from 17 to 21 November .
How the seats will be ready at the back of the plane - in particular , there will be 9 or 10 head seats head - is essential for the economic output of the &quot; mini-@@ j@@ umb@@ o &quot; seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says its &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X &quot; re@@ organization will be able to welcome 40@@ 6 people to economic class in more than 17 chic@@ ken seats , and will be confi@@ gu@@ red with 10 seats per row .
Airbus points out that the competing version of its A@@ 350 will carry in economic class 350 people in 18 h@@ ens of large h@@ alls in the middle of 9 .
The aircraft gi@@ ants often exchange cou@@ ps on technical issues by making advertising in the professional press .
Today , Airbus directly calls on the public before the a@@ ero@@ space sal@@ ion in Dub@@ ai , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take the step of its competitors with more than 100 orders .
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation of a pho@@ to showing three people against each other in restaur@@ ants , entitled &quot; Do you accept it ? &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ distance flights in tighter seats than in regional tur@@ bo@@ li@@ ers &quot; , indicated John Le@@ a@@ h@@ y , the commercial director of Airbus .
As eating habits change , people grow , but the seats in aircraft have not radically changed .
Between the beginning of the 1970 &apos;s , when Bo@@ eing &apos;s ju@@ m@@ bo 7@@ 47 defined the modern long-@@ mail trip , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 has increased by 10 % , according to data from the American Department of Health .
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 chic@@ ken , according to American health statistics .
Airbus says that its rival is cl@@ inging to a concept of sie@@ ge that dates from the 195@@ 0s , when the circum@@ conference of the new@@ ly-@@ qualified de@@ vice called &quot; j@@ et s@@ et &quot; was closer .
Airbus adds that she ordered a study showing that a chic@@ ken extra in the wid@@ th of the seats would improve the quality of sle@@ ep of 53 % .
Bo@@ o@@ king the figures from Airbus regarding the wid@@ th of the seats and claims that it &apos;s not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance tickets and equipment .
He also says that the study shows that the experience in cab@@ in does not depend only on the wid@@ th of the seats .
&quot; It &apos;s really a question of providing the air companies with flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities . &quot; He said K@@ ent Con@@ gratul@@ ations in charge of passenger satisfaction at Bo@@ eing .
They don &apos;t want to be told what will allow them to be profitable .
They know their business better than anyone .
For passengers , it &apos;s more a question of having a certain freedom of movement , but for providers , it &apos;s increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute hi@@ des a race at the orders of aircraft for an estimated $ 700 M@@ d at the market price in the coming decades , enough to ti@@ p the balance of American and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters pointed out for the first time in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what fe@@ eds the battle between the very last devices .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing both claim an output yield per seat in their latest models of long-@@ distance ste@@ ers 20 % higher than that of the market leader in this seg@@ ment , the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ 00@@ ER of 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing depends in part on the comparison between the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation with 10 seats per row and a 7@@ 77 model of origin confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated in line with 9 .
The gain in unit costs is low compared to the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated de@@ vice with 10 seats per row currently in service .
&quot; Bo@@ eing does that to be able to c@@ up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products &quot; , said K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ ist@@ on , director of Con@@ t P@@ ass@@ ag@@ er at the European gre@@ edy Airbus .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say that j@@ uni@@ or cab@@ ins with 10 seats per row in the 7@@ 77 existing ones suggest that many passengers pronoun@@ ce themselves in favor of a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates .
&quot; An 18 h@@ ens sie@@ ge would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the proposal of Airbus is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 &quot; , declared the internal expert at M@@ ary Kir@@ by , fun@@ ny and ed@@ itor of R@@ Un@@ l Net@@ works .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but propose a catalogue of suppliers among which the airlines have to choose .
The aircraft sel@@ lers who turn around the world even with them one me@@ tre to check the competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While taking reven@@ ge to offer comfortable devices , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high den@@ sity confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations to low-cost air companies and regional tri@@ ps .
Airbus offers an A@@ 350 confi@@ g@@ ur@@ é with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus stressed the need for a greater character of the cab@@ ins by offering larger seats side by side to some of its aircraft .
Without the support of the only other big buil@@ der of big modern devices , experts say that his call to the aviation industry is unlikely to put in place a size standard for seats . But it could make the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X sales wave forget about the sales wave .
O@@ ir@@ ac@@ le shareholders irrit@@ ated by El@@ ison &apos;s salary
A majority of shareholders in O@@ ra@@ ac@@ le voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the foun@@ der and director General Lar@@ ry El@@ ison , given the financial performance of his group .
The vote is not binding but tar@@ n@@ ishes the image of L@@ ar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , third world fortune just au@@ ti@@ stic of the victory of her boat at the World Cup .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire still has 25 % of the capital of the software software he co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
Last year , El@@ ison had suffered a negative vote on its remuneration .
The bos@@ s of O@@ ra@@ c@@ le renoun@@ ced a $ 1.2 million bon@@ us for the financial year 2013 closed in May because of the group &apos;s poor performance , which missed its growth goals , but it received about 77 million dollars linked to stock@@ -@@ options .
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar .
Of the entire year out of 2013 , the net benefit of O@@ rac@@ le has increased by 3.5 % while the rate of exchange rate at 27@@ .5 % , over@@ performing the S &amp; P 500 % that took 24 % at the same time .
The new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine could remove smoking pleasure
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine that could remove the pleasure you take to smoke a cigarette .
Only one do@@ se of the vaccine has been able to protect for life from nic@@ ot@@ ine dependence .
Other tests are necessary before starting tests on human beings , but Professor R@@ on@@ ald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of the We@@ g Cor@@ n@@ ell Me@@ di@@ cal College said that the first signs were encouraging .
&quot; We really hope that this kind of vacc@@ in@@ ale strategy can help millions of smokers who tried to stop , exha@@ u@@ sting all the methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches &quot; , said Professor Cor@@ n@@ ell .
The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information necessary to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus selec@@ tively infected li@@ ver cells , which then begins to produce a regular flow of anti@@ bodies .
Anti@@ bodies are betra@@ ying all m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules of nic@@ ot@@ ine present in the blood system and counter@@ acting them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having his do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
During the tests , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice to whom we then gave nic@@ ot@@ ine continued their activity normally .
But m@@ ice that had not been vacc@@ inated &quot; were al@@ la@@ yed &quot; , said researchers , sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their brain .
The experiences are described in the jour@@ nal Science Trans@@ la@@ in .
The previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they &apos;@@ re content with anti@@ bodies .
In@@ fec@@ tions had to be repeated so frequently for anti@@ bodies to remain high that they were too expensive and im@@ practical .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells in anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if the future human vaccine for human use was completely safe , we could give it to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to the nic@@ ot@@ ine .
But it is more likely that it is used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
&quot; They will know that if they start smoking again , they will not be happy because of the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and it will help them to lose their bad habit , &quot; he added .
British scientists said that the results were interesting but pointed out that much more research was necessary .
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a dr@@ one .
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south , was killed in a strike by an American dr@@ one on Friday in Pakistan , we learned from the security services .
The death of H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south has been announced several times already in the past .
But intelligence leaders , army , and activis@@ t movement have said this time that he had lost his life in this strike , conducted in the North W@@ az@@ ir@@ ris@@ an region .
&quot; We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south was killed in a dr@@ one sho@@ ot &quot; , said a senior security officer .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister N@@ awa@@ z Shar@@ if , moving to London , informed the British government that discussions had been started with Te@@ h@@ ri@@ k e Pakistan ( T@@ T@@ P ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by O@@ be@@ id .
The former Lab@@ or minister of New York of South Jo@@ e Tri@@ pol@@ di will be the subject of an investigation of the State &apos;s anti-@@ corruption regulator .
Former New York minister of South Jo@@ e Tri@@ pol@@ di denied having changed the policy of business to the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three property in the govern@@ ment-@@ controlled zone .
Friday , the Independent Commission Commission Against Cor@@ ruption ( I@@ CA@@ C ) broad@@ ened its investigation to know if Mr. O@@ be@@ id had put pressure on several ministers of the state to renew his b@@ au@@ bles in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four , where the O@@ be@@ ds have two restaur@@ ants and a coffee , after Their exp@@ ir@@ ation in August 2005 , without there being any call for tender .
She is now investigating the claims that Mr Tri@@ po@@ di was aware of the secret interest of Mr. O@@ be@@ d in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of the former General Secretary of Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , Lyn@@ ne A@@ po@@ le , Thursday .
In the years of discussions started in 2005 , the government pressed for the b@@ alls to be subject to ten@@ ders .
The ten@@ ants were against and also wanted longer times .
In 2009 , the b@@ ars concerning companies in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Four , which reported to the O@@ be@@ id about $ 2.5 M per year , were renewed without there being any call for tender .
Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , who was Minister of Por@@ ts from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of ten@@ ders .
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. O@@ be@@ d who , acknowledged Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di , called for a change in government policy in matters of bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
The trans@@ cri@@ ption of telephone convers@@ ations presented at the I@@ CA@@ C showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ pol@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of M O@@ be@@ id to the Ministry of F@@ ishing .
&quot; The subject under discussion during these phone convers@@ ations was the drawing up of the trade policy policy ? &quot; , asked the Commissioner An@@ th@@ ony W@@ he@@ al@@ y to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; No &quot; , replied Mr. Tri@@ po@@ di .
I don &apos;t remember what we discussed but in any case it was not that .
Any@@ way , certainly not between me and Mr O@@ be@@ id .
Israeli war@@ planes targeting Syria , says a person .
Israeli war@@ planes reached a target in the Syrian port city of La@@ ta@@ k@@ ia Thursday night , confirms a military officer at Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The official di@@ dn &apos;t specify what the target was , but said that there were at least one .
The Associ@@ ated P@@ ress reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 .
At least twice this year , Israel conducted air strikes against missile car@@ goes in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa could have to pass a &quot; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &quot; test .
The government is currently studying the possibility of putting in place a &quot; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &quot; test for foreign workers in ownership of a 4@@ 57 while considering extending repression measures .
The test , if adopted , would be applied according to a criterion to prevent Vis@@ as 4@@ 57 from being used to occupy un@@ skilled positions or as a hi@@ de@@ ous way to bring their family and friends to Australia .
A working document from the government was un@@ ve@@ iled today while Labour MEP Ma@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w denounced the government dis@@ course on foreign workers , saying it could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbors .
&quot; The sh@@ it statements about &quot; foreigners turning over the end of the qu@@ e@@ ue &quot; and &quot; jobs for the Australia first &quot; are a unpleasant return when unions asked for a protected labor market , &quot; she told the Australia Indi@@ a Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , it meant that the work of wh@@ ites had to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical ar@@ te@@ play .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been planned by the former immigration minister Ch@@ ris Bo@@ en .
The Minister of Im@@ migrants B@@ ren@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking , has implemented five of the recommended changes , the others being in the process of being examined .
If the &quot; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &quot; criterion was adopted , a visa applicants could be checked to know &quot; if the job offer is auth@@ enti@@ c in the case of the candidate is a personal relationship or an associate of the owner or the person concerned within the company that spons@@ ors it . &quot;
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be required to declare the number of holders of visas 4@@ 57 after some of them , having had the intention of spons@@ oring a small number of workers , actually used hundreds .
Meanwhile , an asylum see@@ ker sa@@ il@@ or 35 years old would be dead of a heart attack after having arrived on a ship carrying asylum seekers on island Chris@@ t@@ ma@@ is this week .
The 9 year-old s@@ ons of man was going to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an adult c@@ ous@@ in that was also on board .
M@@ an was urgently transferred by the Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities to the hospital on Is@@ land Chris@@ tw@@ as , where he died .
A study aimed at multi@@ plying the benefits of the rail project H@@ S@@ 2 for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work done by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d suggests that high speed services to Scotland and north of England will start from the opening of P@@ as@@ se 1 in 20@@ 26 .
K@@ ram@@ er &apos;s Minister of Trans@@ portation said that the project &quot; would bring together the United Kingdom &quot; .
Scottish Minister for Transport , K@@ e@@ ith Brown said &quot; exc@@ ited &quot; the idea of working with the British government on the project .
P@@ as@@ se 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When P@@ ha@@ se 2 will be completed , the lines will serve Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government raised the summer cost of building the high-speed link between London and north of England from 3@@ 2.@@ 7 M@@ d to 4@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ d £ £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 .
The British government , which is in talks with S@@ co@@ t@@ land , asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of travel for north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of journey times between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh from three hours at the most .
K@@ ra@@ mer said : &quot; Our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 concerns a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer . &quot;
We are pushing the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous .
Without him , we are facing a problem with our railway network capacity .
But it &apos;s also a question of developing the connec@@ tivity between the 18 big British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that the links between them are better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ is@@ ta@@ r Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el , added : &quot; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &quot;
For the Scottish government , K@@ e@@ ith Brown called Mr Car@@ mi@@ ha@@ el to support &quot; un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable &quot; the inclusion of Scotland in the H@@ S@@ 2 network .
Mr G@@ ord@@ on said : &quot; The high speed train has the potential to offer Scotland considerable economic benefits , but it also brings Scotland &apos;s economic weight in the overall project of high-speed rail network throughout Great Britain .
&quot; We are therefore exc@@ ited at working in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network up to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and comple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning .
&quot; I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then decide together about the next steps . &quot;
The rules concerning the use of electronic devices on board remain in force for the time being in Australia .
Australia &apos;s air passengers will have to continue to switch off their t@@ ab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones during the take@@ off and landing despite the gesture by the United States to rela@@ x the regulations on electronic devices .
The Federal American Administration has left the door open for American ha@@ uli@@ ers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch video or play games on their devices during critical flight stages provided they are in &quot; plane &quot; .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do it for most of the the@@ ft , but many people find it painful not to be able to access their electronic books during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Australia &apos;s ha@@ uli@@ ers are considering the decision that requires American ha@@ uli@@ ers to do important work in order to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they don &apos;t have the intention in the immediate future to change their procedures .
The Civil Au@@ th@@ ia Civil Authority also said that it was considering the announcement but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight stages were still in force in Australia .
&quot; CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices by plane &quot; , she said .
The question is the subject of regulation that requires aircraft operators to guarantee permanent security and passengers to respect the safety instructions given by crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , who has already spoken to the CA@@ SA of its intention to expand the use of its enter@@ tainment system on board the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology , was open to change , but said that it would follow the regul@@ ator .
&quot; We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have ( from the enter@@ tainment system on board the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology ) on our planes , has indicated a spokes@@ person .
Q@@ an@@ it@@ as said that it respects the current rules at the moment .
&quot; In line with our current policy , electronic devices cannot be used during the take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we do not intend to change it in the short term , she said .
The FA@@ A &apos;s decision applies to American air companies .
However , we are still interested in the regulations that could benefit passengers , and we will closely examine the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For American ha@@ uli@@ ers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
Air@@ lines will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices , as well as review the tex@@ t@@ books , training equipment , hand lu@@ gg@@ age program and the instructions provided to passengers .
&quot; As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use light mobile devices , like t@@ ab@@ lets , electronic read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phone to all the al@@ abilities &quot; , declared the FA@@ A .
In rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to switch off their devices during the landing .
The group also recommended that heavi@@ er devices be safe under the seats or in superior compar@@ tments during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
P@@ ia : at least four w@@ ounded in a violent fight .
P@@ ia &apos;s little municip@@ ality has experienced an unusual excess of f@@ ever Thursday night .
Three gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie vehicles , two am@@ bul@@ ances and a st@@ umbling block of thirty people according to the testi@@ monies collected ...
Today of H@@ all@@ we@@ en , the evening was ag@@ it@@ ated on P@@ ia &apos;s side where a ri@@ x@@ y involving several people broke out on the Po@@ st side .
Four mil@@ der injured at least would be la@@ ugh@@ ing .
Al@@ er@@ ted , the police went there to separate the bel@@ li@@ ge@@ rents and make sure that the w@@ ounded are taken care of .
l@@ enders on the basis of Singapore benefit from the middle classes who are forced to wear their bel@@ ts .
At a len@@ der on the guarantee of the B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er commercial center in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani Ad@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a breaks a br@@ ass , a jo@@ ke and a gold ta@@ p in gold to pay for the scho@@ oling of his girls .
&quot; My hus@@ band and I have just bought a house so my money is there , &quot; says Mrs A@@ mi@@ ro@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
Although she ear@@ ns $ 3 000 from Singapore ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) per month as an acc@@ ess@@ ory and her hus@@ band also works , monthly family income is not enough , she says .
In fact , the demand is such in parts of Sou@@ theast Asia - where household indeb@@ tedness increases - that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , where she has carried out her transaction , has become the third loan company on the guarantee to be introduced at the Singapore stock exchange this week .
En@@ suring je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a quick way to get cash - $ 1 300 of Singapore in the case of Mrs A@@ mi@@ ro@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a - but it &apos;s almost as cheap as un@@ guaranteed bank loans .
In general , l@@ enders on the basis of Singapore raise an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by the United O@@ ver@@ se@@ as Bank , a local fund donor with a branch in the same commercial center .
However , l@@ unch l@@ enders have the advantage of not asking for cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or salary proof , and can release loans more quickly than banks .
As a result , millions of people around the region are turning to l@@ unch l@@ enders while families feel the pressure that increases the cost of living and the over@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis , and the cheap credit fu@@ elled by a monetary policy that is too len@@ i@@ ent in the advanced economies , low-@@ income and average families are turning to l@@ unch l@@ enders to fill the difference while their economies are experiencing a slowing down .
This week , the rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ora cited the growing indeb@@ tedness of households , mainly because of the rise in mortgage loans , as a risk factor for the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore recorded the highest household indeb@@ tedness / gross domestic product in Asia .
Malaysia arri@@ ves at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , while this rate was 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists also fear the high level of consumer indeb@@ tedness in Thailand , which has been out of a technical recession this week .
Thursday , data has shown continuous weaknesses in exports and a slowing of consumer demand .
&quot; The balance sheet is that with the increase in costs , people in the middle or at the bottom &#91; of the salary scale &#93; seek to complete their income as they can , &quot; says S@@ ong S@@ ong W@@ a , an economist at CI@@ M@@ B , a Malaysia bank .
His@@ tor@@ ically high gold prices in the last two years have made people ha@@ st@@ ened to put their personal effects in order to touch the cash value of their je@@ wel@@ ry .
In Singapore , about 70 % of the articles in the 200 loan shops on the condition of the ci@@ te@@ -@@ state are in gold .
People say , &quot; the price of gold is high , let &apos;s put up the golden channel of grand@@ mother and we will return it next month &quot; .
In Thailand , the biggest loan shop operator on the guarantee , E@@ asylum Mon@@ ey , recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using their shops in the last few months .
The increase is such in the loan sector on the guarantee that V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x , operator of the shop to B@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore , plans to develop not only in neighb@@ oring Malaysia - where it already counts four shops - but also outside Asia , says . ah Le@@ e Ch@@ ing , his chief manag@@ er .
Society will finance them by using 60 % of the $ 66 M she raised this week during her introduction to the Singapore stock exchange .
While some reduced l@@ enders have come under criticism for the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates they practice , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah indicates that the delivery offers not only lower rates than other l@@ enders , but also that it does not directly increase debt .
&quot; clients hypo@@ the@@ tical property they already have , and the fact of mone@@ tiz@@ ing their personal property does not increase household indeb@@ tedness &quot; , she says .
D@@ em@@ on@@ str@@ ation is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term .
People who travel to l@@ enders are not only those who have financial problems .
The aff@@ lu@@ ent people of Singapore also go to the loan shops on V@@ alum@@ e@@ Ma@@ x to guarantee gold ling@@ ers or Ro@@ le@@ x mon@@ sters , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price in cash .
We see clients of all str@@ ata of society .
&quot; It &apos;s easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments , or small companies with cash needs to go through a difficult course &quot; adds M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes , they just need money very quickly .
Pa@@ ste@@ ur accused of juven@@ ile pornography in New Scotland
A bos@@ s who took care of young people , in the H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x region in New Scotland , is accused of juven@@ ile pornography .
A@@ ar@@ on H@@ ud@@ g@@ ins , aged 30 years old , was arrested on Friday morning following sear@@ ches at his home and at the office of the National Council of the research where he works .
The church B@@ ap@@ tist of Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ y , where the pa@@ st@@ or official official said , is deeply sadd@@ ened by this news .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , church officials indicate that Mr H@@ ud@@ g@@ ins resigned from his post .
The pa@@ st@@ or was released under conditions .
In particular , he must not communicate with people under the age of 18 and don &apos;t access the internet .
He will appear in the prov@@ in@@ cial court in H@@ ali@@ fa@@ x in December .
He travel@@ s in a Nazi uniform to the super@@ market , before being hun@@ ted down .
A man d@@ ressed in a uniform Nazi uniform of a b@@ is@@ se with the gam@@ ble was asked to leave an English super@@ market , customers having complained to the management of the establishment who called the police , indicated the store Friday .
&quot; We received several complaints from clients , so we asked him to leave the magaz@@ ine &quot; , explained a spokes@@ person for the super@@ market chain As@@ da .
The magaz@@ ine called the police to the rescue , but &quot; the time it arri@@ ves , he was already left without es@@ p@@ an@@ re &quot; , she added .
I &apos;@@ ve qu@@ eu@@ ed when I saw a woman who seemed to be shocked .

Re@@ li@@ ef plan of $ 3@@ 25 M for the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system
The federal government maintain that the $ 3@@ 25 M $ rescue package for the va@@ un@@ ting health system is accompanied by strict conditions aimed at ensuring that the government of the state doesn &apos;t waste funds .
The Federal Minister of Health T@@ an@@ ya Pol@@ liber@@ ek announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is currently taking &quot; urgent measures &quot; to put an end to a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state , the high rate of chronic diseases and the limitations of the system .
The funding , planned for 4 years , was decided after the government consultations with the independent deputy of T@@ as@@ man@@ man@@ ia An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&quot; The government has proposed a emergency rescue package that , in our opinion , will solve the unique difficulties facing the state . &quot; said Mrs Pol@@ liber@@ ek today .
The $ 3@@ 25 M plan includes a $ 31 M campaign for un@@ urgent sur@@ ger@@ y operations .
2 600 additional operations , especially in the field of or@@ th@@ opa@@ e@@ dic sur@@ ger@@ y and cam@@ ar@@ act , will help make up for the delay .
funds are also planned for clin@@ ics without meeting in H@@ ob@@ art and La@@ un@@ c@@ es@@ ton , better external care , the training of medical frameworks , mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical files systems in local hospitals .
&quot; These investments respond to the idea that , according to the first line clin@@ ic@@ ians , this is the best way to treat T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , said Mrs Pol@@ se@@ k .
The Minister said that T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s government would be confronted with a strict regime of preparation of reports and accounts .
The State will have to maintain current funding levels to receive money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds .
A commission of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible .
Mr. Wil@@ k@@ ie said today that the $ 3@@ 25 M will not count for much &quot; unless they are followed by a real reform to strengthen T@@ as@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system .
Nevertheless , he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request he presented to Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&quot; I hope that the federal assistance plan will make a big contribution to removing the public health system from T@@ as@@ man@@ man@@ de the black@@ list &quot; , said Mr. Wil@@ k@@ ie .
According to the government of the State , these non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But the spokes@@ person of the opposition in health matters Peter Du@@ t@@ ton thinks that today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft solution &quot; .
&quot; The reason we are here is that the Labour government of the State with@@ drew $ 4@@ 30 M from its health system , &quot; he said on A@@ BC TV .
We can &apos;t have a government government that gr@@ u@@ ds almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth that puts 300 M , and claims that it &apos;s a good day .
Mr Du@@ t@@ ton visited Mr@@ s@@ . Pol@@ se@@ k to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent in additional red tape .

Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons , declare the monitoring body .
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and am@@ muni@@ tion filled with toxic gas , declared the international chemical weapons monitoring body Thursday , while violent clashes ra@@ ged in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian milit@@ ants has also said Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost 3 years ago .
The announcement of the Organization for the banning of chemical weapons ( O@@ IA@@ C ) has arrived with a advance day on the date of the
1 November set by the organization based in The Hague ordered Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or &quot; make un@@ us@@ able &quot; all the chemical weapons production units and machines aimed at mi@@ xing toxic gas and filling am@@ muni@@ tion .
Com@@ ple@@ tion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable aimed at destroying the chemical weapons of Dam@@ as@@ cus by mid-@@ 2014 .
Thanks to the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
We think that the country has about 1 000 tonnes of chemical and chemical weapons , especially mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the neuro@@ toxic agent s@@ ar@@ in .
The announcement was made when the fighting was ra@@ ging Thursday in the city of Sa@@ fi@@ ra which , according to the experts , is home to a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites , reported the Syrian Observ@@ atory on Human Rights based in Great Britain .
The group of milit@@ ants , which follows the evolution of the human balance thanks to a network of milit@@ ants based in Syria , said Thursday that 120 2@@ 96 people were dead .
Among them , it is estimated that there were 61 civilians , 6 3@@ 65 of them children .
On the government side , it is estimated that 29 9@@ 54 members of the armed forces of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad died , 18 6@@ 78 of which were fighters of the pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 milit@@ ants of Lebanon Lebanon .
Among the deaths , it is also estimated that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ ters and about 5 3@@ 75 opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
On July 25 , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
She di@@ dn &apos;t update this figure since then .
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict .
The al-@@ Assad troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom are linked to groups of the al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a network , in Sa@@ fi@@ ra for weeks .
The Observ@@ atory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides , but did not give any prec@@ ision .
The fighting has underlined the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors while they have to complete their mission , which consists of getting Syria rid of its toxic arsen@@ al in the middle of a civil war that continues , within tight deadlines .
A declaration by the O@@ IA@@ C , working closely together with the UN , said that its team was &quot; now satisfied to have controlled - and seen destroyed ) all the critical critical production and machines for mi@@ xing and filling . &quot;
She added that &quot; no other inspection activity was planned for the moment &quot; .
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They could not visit the last two sites because of concerns about their security , indicated the inspectors .
Thursday , the O@@ IA@@ C said that both sites were , according to Syria , &quot; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they content had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &quot; .
It was difficult to know at first sight if Sa@@ fi@@ ra &apos;s unity was one of the two sites that the O@@ IA@@ C inspectors could not visit .
Syria has submitted a plan of total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved in the following month by the O@@ IA@@ C executive committee .
&quot; I sal@@ ute the moral strength and courage that you all showed in the most difficult task ever taken by this organization &quot; , said the Man@@ aging Director of the organization Ah@@ met U@@ met U@@ zu@@ m@@ u , in a comment published by the O@@ IA@@ C .
Now in its third year , the civil war is mainly opposed by the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of al-@@ Assad and its security forces , who are supported by the A@@ law@@ ite sec@@ t sec@@ t , a branch of Sh@@ i &apos;@@ ite Islam .
On the other hand , the director of the Syrian Observ@@ atory on Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of La@@ ta@@ k@@ ia .
The cause of the explo@@ sions is still unknown , he added .
Col@@ ère caused by the sentence handed down against one of the bom@@ bers in Bali
The survi@@ v@@ ors and the relatives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the attacks in Bali in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence pronounced against the last con@@ spir@@ ators to be brought to justice , saying that U@@ mar P@@ ate@@ ek should be shot by a fir@@ ing pe@@ g .
P@@ ate@@ ek , who spent almost 10 years being one of the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after men in Sou@@ theast Asia , was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used during the attacks .
He could be released after a period of 15 years under conditions of liberation .
The 45 year old man was found guilty of mass killing for attacks aimed at two night bo@@ xes in K@@ ut@@ a &apos;s popular tourist neigh@@ bor@@ hood , which caused the death of 20@@ 2 people , including 88 Australia , and made many w@@ ounded people .
He was also found guilty of many other charges in connection with terrorism , especially a wave of attacks aimed at churches in all Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The prosecu@@ tors asked for a life sentence of imprisonment , yet they could have asked for the man , qualified as &quot; D@@ em@@ ol@@ tion M@@ an &quot; for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs , to be sentenced to death .
The decision has revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Per@@ th who lost her two tw@@ ins of 39 , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction perpetrated by P@@ ate@@ ek and the other con@@ spir@@ ators almost 10 years ago .
On the te@@ ars , she said that P@@ at@@ ek should have been sentenced to death .
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men .
&quot; He should be dra@@ gged in front of execution &quot; , said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en to the A@@ A@@ P .
I have to live every day without having other grand@@ children , nor see my girls .
Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , charged in a gu@@ y outside , explo@@ ded just after 23 hours : 12 October 2002 .
Peter H@@ ell@@ es was in P@@ ad@@ dy@@ e s B@@ ar when a k@@ am@@ k@@ a@@ ze sa@@ iled a ba@@ g with do@@ s charged with explo@@ si@@ ves barely 20 seconds earlier .
He s@@ ank in the com@@ a after the attack and stay@@ ed un@@ conscious for a month , and he &apos;s &quot; dead &quot; three times when he was under res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr. Hu@@ gues said that P@@ at@@ ek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ l@@ as and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a - who were executed 4 years ago .
In reality , this man should have been sentenced to death before the others .
keep him alive , why , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
S@@ tri@@ ke 20 years in prison after killing 20@@ 2 people and inj@@ uring hundreds of others , it &apos;s not a lot .
P@@ ate@@ ek is the last of the bom@@ bers in Bali to be brought to justice .
He managed to avoid being cap@@ tured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Ab@@ bo@@ t@@ ab@@ ad , where American forces will kill the former al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a leader , Os@@ ama bin Lad@@ en , less than four months later .
During the trial , an F@@ B@@ I agent said that intelligence reports revealed that P@@ ate@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet B@@ in Lad@@ en with the aim of restoring links between terrorist groups in Sou@@ theast Asia and al-@@ Q@@ a &apos;@@ id@@ a .
&quot; He di@@ dn &apos;t visit &quot; , added Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
Until recently , he di@@ dn &apos;t care about the gri@@ ef he could cause other people .
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by cere@@ monies in Bali and Australia .
&quot; There &apos;s a lot of be@@ aches this year &quot; , said Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
P@@ ate@@ ek can appeal against his conviction .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on board aircraft ( but not appeal with their mobile phone )
Air@@ lines passengers will be able to use their electronic doors from door to door to read , work , play games , watch mo@@ vi@@ es and listen to music - but not talk about their mobile phone - according to the new very awaited directives published by the Federal A@@ vi@@ eration Administration on Thursday .
But passengers should not expect immediate changes .
The speed with which the change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another , declared the chief executive of the FA@@ A Mic@@ hael H@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
Air@@ lines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their planes comply with the new directives and that they update the training books of crew members and the rules concerning the row of equipment to be in line .
The FA@@ A said that it had already received plans from some air companies aimed at broad@@ ening the use of electronic devices on their aircraft .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ B@@ lu@@ e are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the plan , we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon &quot; , indicated the FA@@ A in a declaration .
At present , passengers have to switch out their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other devices as soon as the doors of the plane are closed .
They are not supposed to r@@ ally them before the plane reaches 10 000 feet and the comm@@ ander gives the green light .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to switch off their devices during the des@@ cent off the plane before the landing and not re@@ kin@@ dle them until the plane has started .
Under the new directives , air companies whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their devices during take@@ -@@ off , lan@@ dings and ground rolling , declared the FA@@ A .
Most of the new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use the W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to higher al@@ titude , should satisfy the criteria .
L@@ will G@@ l@@ ent , president of the Association of Pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion@@ al F@@ light . F@@ light , it was said of these changes .
&quot; Once the new policy has been implemented in a safe manner - and we &apos;@@ ll work closely with the ha@@ uli@@ ers for this - it will be beneficial to everyone , &quot; explained G@@ lad@@ ing in a declaration .
We are frankly tired of feeling like &quot; room gu@@ ys &quot; when it comes to this question .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the internet for sur@@ f@@ er , exchange em@@ ail@@ s and SM@@ S or down@@ load data below 10 000 feet , declared the agency .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their smar@@ t@@ phones , t@@ ab@@ lets and other aircraft on plane mode .
So no Wor@@ ds W@@ it@@ ch , the S@@ cr@@ b@@ ble online online game played by the actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win on his smar@@ t@@ phone in 2011 when he was ev@@ ic@@ ted with great noise from an American Air@@ lines plane after refusing to switch off his At the same time as the de@@ vice was kept on the door .
And heavi@@ er devices like lap@@ top computers will always have to be stuck because they could inj@@ ure someone if they ste@@ ered through the cab@@ in .
Mob@@ ile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
The legislative power concerning mobile phones belongs to the Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A can remove the ban on certain electronic devices during take@@ -@@ off and landing
Last month , Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of the National Trans@@ portation S@@ af@@ et@@ y Board , national transport security expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , said that mobile phones were always considered a risk .
&quot; Mob@@ ile phones are really a problem , not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the F@@ CC@@ C , that they could distur@@ b mobile phone rela@@ ys if they are used on board &quot; , has declared Ros@@ en@@ ker .
An industrial consultation committee created by FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government auth@@ oriz@@ es a more widespread use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has become stronger in recent years to rela@@ x restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics like Sen@@ ator Mc@@ C@@ ast@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o , maintain that there is no valid security reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also becoming more and more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ itous .
Some studies indicate that at least a third of passengers forget to switch off their devices , or do it deliberately .
The FA@@ A started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying F@@ M radi@@ os , the hi@@ -@@ tech g@@ ad@@ get from then on .
New line air@@ planes depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
Air@@ lines allow their passengers to use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to cru@@ ise al@@ abilities for several years .
modified aircraft to welcome W@@ i-@@ F@@ i systems also better resist interference .
The vast majority of line planes should allow more use of electronic devices by virtue of the new directives , said Hu@@ er@@ ta .
Today &apos;s electronic devices are generally issuing radio trans@@ missions of power much lower than previous generations of devices .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic books , for example , only em@@ it minimum trans@@ missions when you turn a page .
But the trans@@ missions are stronger when the down@@ load devices or send data .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is one of those who press for rela@@ xing restrictions regarding the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , company leaders loaded a line of online read@@ ers of electronic books K@@ ind@@ le and made him ste@@ al to see if there were problems , but there were none .
This inspired the members of the FA@@ A &apos;s SA@@ A Consul@@ tative Committee with mixed feelings about the question of whether or not the use of devices presents a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said he thought that interference from equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee said that only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots indicate that equipment can interfere with the systems of an aircraft , and that most of them are very old .
However , the committee recommended that the FA@@ A auth@@ oriz@@ es pil@@ ots to ask passengers to switch off their equipment during landing to the instruments under conditions of low visibility .
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes , calling them common sense arrangements for travellers with technology .
&quot; We are happy that the FA@@ A recognize that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security , &quot; said Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , President and director of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . T@@ ve@@ vel Association .

Is the European elite ready to do business with Great Britain ?
The Business for Brit@@ ons campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together companies and define what wealth and jobs creat@@ ors want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
To do this , we ordered the wid@@ est and most complete investigation with British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Great Britain , companies and the EU .
Y@@ ou@@ Go@@ v questioned more than 1 000 business leaders , generally representative of all sizes of companies , sectors and regions of Great Britain .
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for many .
We discovered that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe , focusing on those countries that modern@@ ize and develop while the EU states stag@@ n@@ ate .
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries like China , India and Brazil rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming the European institutional ar@@ can@@ es .
When asked their opinion on specific political points - from the regulation of the monopolies to product laws - the majority of business leaders think that control of these key competences should go back to West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market has caused general dis@@ content , companies say that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade zone - 40 % of big companies , traditionally the most pro-European , even agree .
Finally , and even more so , our investigation with business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue the initiatives to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics .
This conclusion , which finds itself in all the big groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a &quot; significant change &quot; that gives power back to the United Kingdom .
The stakes are high - succeed in changing the treaty and better represent Britain &apos;s interests would see a 16 % shift of votes in favor of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt : this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate the terms of Britain &apos;s accession to the EU .
It also shows that companies hope that re@@ negotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favor of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to better represent the interests of British companies , since the euro area is committing itself to a closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be jobs and growth in Great Britain and , as our investigation shows , for companies it means putting the acc@@ ent on trade again and a fundamental change of the Brussels regulation approach .

Alex@@ e@@ i Mill@@ er Gaz@@ pro@@ m says that Bulgaria &apos;s gas pipeline aug@@ urs a new era of gas .
The start of construction of South Street in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s biggest energy projects , declared the director of Gaz@@ pro@@ m .
&quot; An historic event took place today : construction started in the Bulgaria part of the South Stream gas pipeline , the biggest project the most important project in Europe &quot; explained Alex@@ e@@ i Mill@@ er , the Man@@ aging Director of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , in a declaration Thursday .
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire continent of Europe .
South Stream should help diversify Russia &apos;s export paths to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and its Ukrainian counterpart , a country through which most of Russia &apos;s gas goes to Europe , increases the level of risk compared to conventional paths , adds the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the ge@@ o-@@ political risks associated with the transit countries are eliminated &quot; for forever &quot; .
Bulgaria &apos;s consumers will receive South Street gas at a reduced price as soon as the whole project is set up in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m has indicated that construction should start in other countries down@@ stream by the end of the year .
The gas pipeline was conceived for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic me@@ ters of natural gas .
Pit@@ t wants to create the biggest marine reserve in the world .
The island of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ ron wants to create the biggest marine reserve in the world , announced the daily daily newspaper The New Ta@@ hi@@ i news , taking into account Rad@@ io Australia &apos;s information .
This island , in the east of the archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last British South Pacific territory , half-@@ way between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory measure 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , if we count three other small ne@@ ar@@ by islands .
He is British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the Bou@@ d@@ ty mutilation , episo@@ de from the story of the English na@@ vy that took place to three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adap@@ tations .
A few dozen people , mostly des@@ c@@ endants of the Bou@@ d@@ ty ma@@ ster@@ ies , still live Pit@@ c@@ ail@@ in , and their income depends 95 % of the generous London .
The Council of island voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , that is 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 that correspond to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the may@@ or of the island went to London ask Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ n , the may@@ or of Pit@@ t , thinks that the creation of such a protected zone would be a first step toward more financial autonomy for his island .
The project must be accepted by the English Govern@@ or of P@@ it@@ c@@ ai@@ ron , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to s@@ nu@@ ff these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided , however , that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There is no airport in Pit@@ c@@ ain@@ n , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area , and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are placed .
As for France , it must already conduct the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 k@@ m@@ 2 of the French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia E@@ E@@ E , its neighbour .
The FA@@ A rela@@ xing the restrictions on the use of electronic g@@ ad@@ ge@@ ts on board aircraft . But it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones .

Li@@ ve life for a former Chinese deputy govern@@ or
A former deputy govern@@ or of the province of Ji@@ in , in the nor@@ theast of China , was sentenced on Friday to life prison for corruption .
Ex@@ c@@ use of the Communist Party in July 2012 , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of having affected more than 19 million y@@ u@@ ans of bri@@ bes , reports the official media Chinese .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the deputy govern@@ or , who was also the president of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public institution , helped companies and responsible companies to get contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first intermedi@@ ary tribunal in Beijing on his micro@@ lo@@ g .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the Communist Party itself .
If the head of state promised that justice would be as in@@ trac@@ table with the powerful &quot; tig@@ ers &quot; - j@@ uni@@ or officials - j@@ uni@@ or officials - only a handful of high-@@ ranking officials were convicted , including former executives of the oil giant Pe@@ tro@@ ch@@ a .
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CC@@ P leader in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , sentenced for life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state .
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-@@ corruption system by creating , for example , an independent organization of the party .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees accused of sexual assault following claims made against J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord during a Ro@@ yal Commission audience .
Two Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employees in New Wales were accused of sexual assault against children following claims made against the Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h educ@@ ator , J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , in 2011 , during a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission responsible for sexual abuse of children .
But in his opening statement before the Commission , the Y@@ M@@ A said that he &quot; had never had to deal with a sexual assault on children within her organization &quot; .
Man@@ aging director Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ re was questioned about two cases : a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A employee was accused of child pornography and a physical education mon@@ itor of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked . It was in 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ re said in G@@ ail F@@ ur@@ st , a lawyer with the Commission , that he was aware of the first case but he was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the opening declaration of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A was in@@ accurate by pointing out , &quot; external controls of the Y@@ M@@ A were carried out and pointed out that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization . &quot;
It was demonstrated in the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A had been informed that it received the second worst assessments on four establishments during a quality audit of the Education and Comm@@ uni@@ ties carried out in August of this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who started working in Y@@ M@@ C@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that the management of staff was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had om@@ itted to check that employees were aware of any violations of children &apos;s security policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord was sentenced for sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years when he worked in Y@@ M@@ C@@ A .
He was sentenced to a minimum prison sentence of 6 years .
But Mr Ha@@ re rejected the idea that the Y@@ M@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord &apos;s flaws in the safety of children .
The staff members testi@@ fied that they had observed certain flaws , especially the fact that Lord remained alone with children , that he kept them in private , st@@ alled them on his k@@ nees , told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone .
Dan@@ i@@ el@@ le O@@ k@@ well , who was fram@@ ed by Lord and who had asked for training in the protection of children because she was worried about her behavior , indicated she found the chief service officer at the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h , J@@ ac@@ who Bar@@ n@@ at , who ho@@ sted Lord &quot; . Very da@@ un@@ ting and difficult to approach most of the time . &quot;
The managing director said that he rejected the testi@@ monies of the staff that they were re@@ tic@@ ent about reporting these flaws to their hier@@ arch@@ ical superior .
Instead , he said that the friendly relations they maintained with Lord have mud@@ d@@ led up their judgment , so they di@@ dn &apos;t report his actions .
Mr Ha@@ re said he had expressed his point of view in front of the advice of the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in New Wales . He said that for the organization , the lesson of &quot; the J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord affair &quot; should not be &quot; the sign &quot; by the staff , and the advice was in agreement with him .
Mr Ha@@ re said that the decision to sign confidentiality agreements , shortly after the claims were mentioned , was taken by the Man@@ aging Director of Y@@ M@@ C@@ A responsible for children &apos;s services , Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ ley .
He said that this decision was aimed at avoiding any infection of evidence but that it was a &quot; excess of ze@@ al &quot; and that it had been badly implemented .
Y@@ M@@ A in New Wales in the South was not a safe organization for children at the time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord was employed , namely between 2009 and 2011 , declared the expert on sexual violence on children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ m@@ all@@ b@@ one at the University of G@@ ri@@ ot University .

He said that there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recruitment , control , initi@@ ation , training and the supervision of staff .
The audience was delayed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again , but ad@@ mits that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office , the 59 years old man made his opinion known about various national policies .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country , Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as special Quartet En@@ voy for the Middle East peace process .
When asked him if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to E@@ ring Stand@@ ard of London : &quot; Yes , of course , but it may happen , so ... &quot; so ... &quot;
When many experts in the demonstrations met in Cardiff to confront and win the tro@@ ph@@ y of the Ch@@ ev@@ al of the year , they knew that the competition would be tough .
But no one expected to see a tri@@ ple Kir@@ ge , a three-@@ year-old child .
Not yet at school and only a few months after having done his first weapons , the small and sh@@ it pon@@ y She@@ t@@ land T@@ off@@ é@@ e have tro@@ t@@ ted out during the three rounds with a great ease and won the first price , leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors .
The two in@@ separ@@ able – which are the same size – were ha@@ iled for presentation , the attitude and the style during the annual competition that took place at the center em@@ itting S@@ un@@ n@@ y@@ bank , in R@@ ud@@ y near Cardiff .
Com@@ ing against men and women with e@@ leg@@ ant male h@@ ats , he was wearing his cam@@ era a bit on the side in a rela@@ xed way to challenge his 2@@ -year old T@@ off@@ al pon@@ y around the run@@ way .
F@@ en@@ on has been welcomed by judges for his natural quality of comp@@ iling little common for a child of his age .
And T@@ off@@ é@@ e received very good notes for her presentation and personality .
F@@ é@@ t@@ on got a gift for her 3@@ r@@ d birth@@ day in March last year and has been involved since then with his She@@ t@@ land pon@@ y every day .
His mother , 30 years old , said : &quot; F@@ en@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e do an excellent du@@ o . &quot;
They presented themselves against and against all , but both of them missed the golden cut and the ros@@ et@@ te .
It was only the second time he went with T@@ off@@ e@@ e and we were cra@@ zy he won .
On the track , people who di@@ dn &apos;t know him thought he was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to be photo@@ graph@@ ed with him .
This young bo@@ y , the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ b@@ b@@ w V@@ ale , in the south of Wales , follows the trac@@ es of his a@@ unt . H@@ ow@@ el@@ ls , who has participated in contest competition for more than 10 years .
Mrs H@@ ow@@ el@@ ls said : &quot; There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applau@@ ded it . &quot;
He went through all the length of the run@@ way running and even if he seemed to be a little small , he did a mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous job .
Mo@@ ve is cra@@ zy of animals - he ad@@ ore hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors and the rural world and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens he deals with .
In the way he started , he will certainly participate soon at the demonstration of the year &apos;s Ch@@ ev@@ al - and I &apos;@@ m sure he will make a nice performance .
A spokes@@ person of the annual demonstration has said : &quot; F@@ en@@ on is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pon@@ y . &quot;
They form a good team .
The judges noticed that F@@ en@@ on and T@@ off@@ é@@ e were presented well and the way they mar@@ ched on the run@@ way .
They are looking for effective te@@ am@@ work between the pon@@ y and the dra@@ in@@ er - Fe@@ t@@ on and T@@ off@@ e@@ e were the best on the run@@ way .
I am sure his beautiful clo@@ thes helped F@@ t@@ on , he really was proud .
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call &quot; will be re@@ worked &quot;
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal on the front page for the release of a journalist accused of def@@ am@@ ation will be re@@ worked , declare a press regulation .
The New Ex@@ press based in Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Ch@@ en later admitted on TV that he accepted bri@@ bes to make stories about a semi-@@ public society .
Now , the New Ex@@ press will undergo a &quot; complete res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le &quot; , declared the regul@@ ator .
The order of &quot; res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le &quot; comes from the Gu@@ ang@@ don administration for Pres@@ se and E@@ di@@ tion , Rad@@ io , F@@ il@@ m , and Tele@@ vision .
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Ex@@ press belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g group E@@ ing Ne@@ ws published several er@@ ron@@ eous articles about the company . Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion company between September 2012 and August 2013 .
&quot; The ed@@ iting of New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organized &quot; , said the regul@@ ator in a statement .
He said he had decided &quot; to impose a sanction of an administrative nature in Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press card &quot; .
He also &quot; ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g group E@@ ing Ne@@ ws to undertake a complete res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Ex@@ press and immediately re@@ write the newspaper &apos;s management team . &quot;
Ch@@ en wrote several articles for the New Ex@@ press on alleged financial irregularities from a construction equipment manufacturer called Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion .
After his arrest , his newspaper twice published a call on first page for his release , writing that he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted he had published false stories against money .
&quot; In this case , I har@@ med Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion as well as the media industry and his ability to win public confidence &quot; , he told the public television network C@@ CC@@ TV .
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebr@@ ity .
I realized my mistake .
Following the excus@@ es of Mr Ch@@ en , New Ex@@ press published his excus@@ es on the front page , writing that he di@@ dn &apos;t check his articles correctly .
Several important suspects have recently made conf@@ essions .
specialists say that people are systematically forced to make their conf@@ essions , despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to blame himself .
The aircraft carrier Char@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le in &quot; un@@ available &quot;
In T@@ oul@@ on , the aircraft carrier is in a sh@@ it .
The radioactive v@@ ap@@ our le@@ ak detected in one of the two nuclear heat of the Char@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le , in mid-@@ October and when the ship was at sea , was &quot; without danger to the sa@@ il@@ ors &quot; , but it &apos;s not without consequences for the Mar@@ ine .
The Ro@@ yal has just confirmed &quot; the un@@ available &quot; of the ship until &quot; in mid-@@ November &quot; , &quot; the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary &quot; on the reactor .
For its part , the D@@ S@@ M company , a defen@@ der of defence , ensures that its teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , dis@@ pat@@ ched in the V@@ ar for the occasion , &quot; currently intervene on the aircraft carrier &quot; .
It &apos;s for them , among others , to change a p@@ ump on the faul@@ ty heat .
&quot; Everything is done for Char@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le to be able to make its deployment planned at the end of 2013 &quot; , but D@@ S@@ T explains .
And the National Mar@@ ine to certi@@ fy that &quot; it doesn &apos;t call into question the ship &apos;s activity program &quot; with nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion .
Let &apos;s remember that the aircraft carrier Char@@ les@@ -@@ de-@@ Gaul@@ le comes out of an intermedi@@ ary period of six months .
He had put in T@@ oul@@ on in mid-@@ October for a training .
This , especially , in order to define young hunting pil@@ ots .
A &quot; little tr@@ ick &quot; , circum@@ s@@ cri@@ bed to the area of contain@@ ment of the reactor , then came on the flagship of the French fleet .
According to the National Mar@@ ine , the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , everywhere , I &apos;@@ m able to see a lot of dis@@ content on the part of the people I meet : mon@@ str@@ ous re-@@ evaluation of their properties , dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ment of taxes , the cost of permits of all kinds , administrative costs to finish .
In short , si@@ ph@@ on@@ age without limits on our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of dollars squ@@ an@@ dered could be saved in order to allow a lot of respect for those who pay .
Any money taken away from taxpayers dimin@@ ishes their freedom of consumption and helps to impover@@ ish them .
In Sha@@ w@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , we don &apos;t anno@@ y ourselves about the s@@ om@@ p@@ tu@@ ary expenses and the maintenance of lame duc@@ ks : deficit cultural center , strong subsidy to C@@ it@@ é de Energy , etc .
If these installations are not profitable , whether we sell them to the private company or to dem@@ ol@@ ish them .
It is also sad to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of several properties to welcome a major industry that has never come .
However , I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a kind of industrial inc@@ ub@@ ator , but at what cost for tax pay@@ ers ?
It &apos;s not for public start-@@ ups to invest in such companies , but for the private sector based on the consumer &apos;s demand .
Citizens were happy to learn that la@@ kes in the F@@ ishing and Pi@@ les will continue to supply the city in drinking water .
As a result of the departure of all the industries ( major water consuming ) and the high population decline , the use of water has decreased considerably everywhere in the territory .
Without wanting to waste it , the city will never miss water and the severe regulation about its use could be greatly sof@@ tened .
In short , it is easy to do great things with the money of others .
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet .
With gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is@@ n &apos;t even able to buy a sty@@ l@@ en without going through a loan regulation .
We have been managed for more than 40 years by ho@@ o@@ ded with beautiful degrees mostly and I don &apos;t think a sheep farmer makes worse .
Dec@@ ades of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway line .
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric ra@@ ils , has been discovered .
The American authorities described the tunnel by 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they had ever seen .
The tunnel , z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag@@ ant on an equivalent length of almost six long so@@ cc@@ er land , links w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ j@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go , the United States .
The area is full of un@@ defined w@@ are@@ houses , which makes it possible to easily cover up dru@@ g@@ s-@@ loaded tr@@ uc@@ ks .
The tunnel was closed before drugs came out in un@@ noticed , said the authorities .
The authorities have confisc@@ ated 8@@ .5 tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel discovery , according to judicial records .
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were accused of marriages of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e with the intention of selling .
They run a prison sentence from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted .
In Nov@@ z@@ al , Ari@@ z@@ ona , the drug dealers exploit large underground channels of underground dra@@ in@@ age .
The tunnel is the eigh@@ th important passage discovered in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the biggest tun@@ n@@ els were discovered following the mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in the center of Mexico in October , raising a challenge for drug car@@ t@@ els who have to quickly hand over their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of about 700 y@@ ards equipped with railway lines that were starting from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en house of Ti@@ ju@@ ana and went to two w@@ are@@ houses in San Di@@ e@@ go .
The British police are issuing an extra@@ d@@ iting mandate against Ass@@ ange .
The British police has today issued an extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant mandate to the foun@@ der of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge in the Em@@ bas@@ sy of the Ecu@@ ador in London and asked for political asylum .
Scot@@ land Y@@ ard said that she had delivered an &quot; surrender opinion &quot; against the 4@@ 0-@@ year-old Australia , asking him to run for a police station , adding that if he did not do it , he would be likely to be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited to Sweden following the claims of sexual crime , after having exhausted all possible paths under the British law after the Supreme Court invali@@ dated the call he gave against his surrender at the beginning of the month .
F@@ air that Stockholm auth@@ oriz@@ es its transfer to the United States , he found refuge at the Em@@ bas@@ ade of Ecu@@ ador in London on June 19 , asking this South American country political asylum .
Scot@@ land Y@@ ard has &quot; delivered a surrender opinion against a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man asking him to run for a police station , on the date of his choice &quot; , said a spokes@@ person .
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under b@@ ail .
The Ambassador refused to comment on the issue of the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange fears being extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of sp@@ ying , after un@@ ve@@ iling more than 250 000 American diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website fighting against secret information .
How Bi@@ ome@@ try will inv@@ ade our lives
No more words to t@@ ack for access to his smar@@ t@@ phone or pay his purchases ?
American , French , or Japanese researchers tell us a future where we will be recognised by the Bi@@ ome@@ tric sen@@ s@@ ors of tele@@ phones and computers .
Ber@@ n@@ ard Di@@ di@@ er , deputy chief executive of Mor@@ ph@@ o , even thinks that &quot; the century will be Bi@@ ome@@ tric &quot; .
Only Bi@@ ome@@ try will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a uni@@ verse as trans@@ verse and trans@@ national as internet .
Organ@@ iz@@ ations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this sw@@ im@@ ming for Bi@@ ome@@ try , but worry about it .
In 2011 and France alone , the National Commission of Information and Freedom has authori@@ zed 7@@ 74 finger@@ printing systems , hand form or ve@@ g@@ in@@ ous network of hand in companies , administrations , can@@ te@@ ens ...
&quot; Everyone can soon be identified , anywhere and anywhere &quot; , Ju@@ dic@@ n Bro@@ o@@ k@@ man , responsible for the privacy of consumers in the CD@@ T ( C@@ enter for Democratic y and Tech@@ no@@ log@@ y ) , in Washington .
The reasons for such an optimis@@ t , at home , and pessimis@@ m , among others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics will be based on new techniques that will make it possible to make new services to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most used Bi@@ ome@@ tric data are fingerprints , the cont@@ ours of the hand and the ve@@ g@@ an network of the break or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its restrictions .
&quot; For example , some people who work concrete have very ab@@ ys@@ s and their fingerprints are il@@ legi@@ ble . &quot; Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , the technical director of the identity domain at Th@@ ales Commission .
And the collection , as well as the verification of the ve@@ g@@ an network and the sle@@ ep of the hand , assumes a voluntary and specific gesture of people .
It &apos;s both a security - we cannot capture these data un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - and one disadvantage : the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and so takes time .
As a result , research has been carried out for about 20 years on other approaches , such as recognition of the face or i@@ ris ( the col@@ or@@ ful part of the eye ) .
Thanks to the increase in the prec@@ ision of sen@@ s@@ ors and the ability to calculate the computers necessary for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The prec@@ ision of the fac@@ ial recognition has multi@@ plied ten@@ fold over the last five years , calcul@@ ates Cy@@ ri@@ ille B@@ at@@ el@@ le , director of the R &amp; D laboratories in Europe .
With our help , the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border cross@@ ings using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or an ir@@ ris on the movement .
&quot; Today , we carry out research on the recognition of voice or the way to walk with sound sen@@ s@@ ors , but we need a silent environment &quot; , says S@@ ri@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , director of the security research in In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
Un@@ ity and in@@ al@@ si@@ reliable , DNA also gives rise to hope and worries .
&quot; In the current state of knowledge , it can be considered the ultimate biometric data &quot; , confirms S@@ op@@ hi@@ e V@@ ul@@ li@@ et T@@ ul@@ li@@ e , head of studies , innovation and the future of C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But the analysis of DNA is still very long and very expensive .
NE@@ T offers judicial police services a value costing 9@@ 0@@ ,000 euros to analy@@ ze DNA s@@ amples in the place of a crime and in an hour .
The uses of biome@@ tr@@ ics are divided into two groups : identi@@ fi@@ er ( recognize someone among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( making sure that the person is the one she claims to be ) .
The identi@@ fi@@ er until now concerned the issue of identity papers : we need to confront the Bi@@ ome@@ tric elements ( fingerprints , pho@@ to , i@@ ris ) with the information that the State has on all citizens already fixed .
This makes it possible to ensure that someone does not try to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison can have other applications .
NE@@ T proposes recognition of V@@ IP at the entr@@ ance of a ho@@ tel or store .
&quot; We &apos;@@ re recovering the images of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compar@@ ing them to photo@@ s of cele@@ bri@@ ties who circul@@ ate freely on the internet &quot; , explains Dan@@ y N@@ assi@@ f , who is responsible , at N@@ EC France , for the commercial development of Bi@@ ome@@ tric identi@@ fi@@ ers .
Another use : take a pho@@ to a dam@@ n that is qu@@ eu@@ ing qu@@ e@@ ue in a store , follow its progress thanks to fac@@ ial recognition and calculate waiting times .
auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation concerned at first physical access ( borders , protected local , can@@ te@@ ens ... ) or logical ( opening of a computer ) .
More recently , there was the monitoring of attendance .
&quot; A Bi@@ ome@@ tric In@@ v@@ estig@@ ation avoi@@ ds the phenomenon of cop@@ ain that is leading for another &quot; , justify C@@ y@@ ri@@ ille B@@ at@@ el , from Ac@@ cen@@ ture .
But more and more , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also affect transactions , especially those made from devices connected to the internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to remove money from certain distributors by introducing his card and putting his hand on a Bi@@ ome@@ tric read@@ er : this gesture re@@ places the h@@ int of the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is tested in V@@ ill@@ en@@ eu@@ u@@ ve@@ -@@ d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and in An@@ dro@@ ll by Nat@@ ural Sec@@ ur@@ ty in partnership with banks and teaching of the big distribution : when paying in a store with its banking card , the cli@@ ent doesn &apos;t ta@@ p his code , but introduces his finger in a read@@ er who s@@ its the ve@@ ins .
The experiment is planned for six months .
If it &apos;s conclu@@ sive , the Bi@@ ome@@ tric read@@ ers could soon arrive at the French tra@@ des@@ men .
S@@ tri@@ kes to reassure users
There are three ways to make Bi@@ ome@@ try attractive in the eyes of the general public .
The first one is to explain that she can save time .
&quot; If , thanks to Bi@@ ome@@ try , a cli@@ ent remains in c@@ ash@@ y thirty seconds less , it &apos;s good &quot; , explains the director of a big surface .
The second is to offer person@@ alized services : in a few years , a thi@@ ef ser@@ ver can recognize your voice and offer you options on measure .
And , finally , reassuring by highlighting the caution taken to protect databases .
&quot; fingerprints are stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos;s identities are on a second basis : the correlation between the two numbers is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure box , which blocks if we try to move it &quot; , lists Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , of Th@@ ales .
But due to lack of thorough studies , it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users .
Pri@@ vate protection specialists , they continue to worry .
&quot; The progress of fac@@ ial recognition , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or P@@ ic@@ sa , make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance &quot; , predic@@ tion An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , the Commission for the Protection of the privacy in Canada .
A driving driver at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink between ham has been me@@ ted out of £ 1@@ 000 .
A car driver has been fin@@ ed £ 1@@ 000 for running at 2@@ 10 km / h with a warm drink that is balanced between his leg@@ s .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ i , 35 years of Ti@@ p@@ ter@@ e in Es@@ sex , was re@@ pen@@ ted leading his Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on the A@@ 120 to the he@@ ight of B@@ ain@@ tre@@ e on May 27 .
When the police stopped him , they discovered the drink to take between his leg@@ s .
At the Court of First In@@ stance of Col@@ ch@@ ester , H@@ ow@@ i admitted driving crime without the necessary caution and attention .
The seven points removed on his permit led to a 6 month permit withdrawal .
H@@ ow@@ i was also sentenced to pay fees of £ 90 and a 100 £ 100 victim victim .
A tax on foreign property owners to bur@@ st the London bubble
The trea@@ sury has temporarily calculated the measure of the capital gains tax but waiting for a definitive decision by Mr Os@@ borne who , in the 2012 budget , has written a 7 % right of stamp for properties costing more than £ 2 M and the annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold properties In the context of a society rather than individually .
The right of stamp already applies to residential properties in distric@@ ts in West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ el@@ sea , and represents £ 7@@ 08 M on the 2012 / 13 tax year , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , Scotland , The Nor@@ theast , Nor@@ th@@ west and the region of Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and H@@ um@@ ber put together .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &quot; Following the increase in the right of stamp on high value properties and the introduction of anti-@@ avo@@ id@@ al law in this area , it is very difficult to advance that the properties of high value are under@@ imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &quot;
&quot; But this change could make foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent about buying properties in London or the current re@@ tic@@ ent owners of the idea of selling &quot; , he added .
The building house of prestige - the 5 to 10 % of the highest prices in the housing market . In the thri@@ ving sector in South London that stret@@ ches from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ b@@ ed@@ on , has increased by a record percentage of 11.@@ 8 % in the last year .
P@@ ric@@ es in the center of London show regular growth from year to year by 5.@@ 6 % but have been over@@ shad@@ owed by a growing &quot; internal market &quot; , the South West of the city , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and is ( 6@@ .5 % ) knowing recovery , according to studies in S@@ A@@ ca@@ de@@ ls .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted the way in which the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to his mood .
Pre@@ vious studies showed that happy dogs more re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed their tail toward the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while the dogs win it more toward the left .
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and answer .
Professor Ge@@ or@@ gi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ scientists from the University of T@@ ren@@ te , said : &quot; Everyone knows that in man , the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimul@@ i that ar@@ ouse positive or negative emotions . . &quot;
Here we tried to see what was happening with other species .
He added that as well as at home , at the dogs , the brain &apos;s right to the left was responsible for movement towards the left and vice versa , and that both ha@@ irs played a different role in emotions .
To know more about how dogs react to the dis@@ ordered qu@@ e@@ ue movements of other dogs , researchers followed animals watching films where other dogs were included .
They measured the car@@ di@@ a@@ c frequency of animals and analysed their behavior .
It will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a explained : &quot; We presented to dogs of films where other dogs included other dogs - either a nat@@ ur@@ alist version or a sil@@ ver to avoid any other confusion factor . . &quot;
When the animals saw a dog without expression up@@ ping the tail toward the right ( from the point of view of the dog that won the tail ) , they stay@@ ed perfectly rela@@ xed .
But when they s@@ acked a qu@@ e@@ ue mainly from the left ( again from the point of view of the dog that won the tail ) , their heart frequency has spe@@ eded up and they seem anxious .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said that he did not think that the dogs deliberately communicate among themselves thanks to these movements .
He thinks rather that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &quot; If you meet on several occasions with other dogs and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their tail toward one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the law leads to a less friendly attitude , you react according to this experience . &quot;
Res@@ ear@@ chers indicate that the results could allow owners , ve@@ ts and d@@ run@@ ks to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The specialist behavior expert John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a prof@@ essor invited to the Scho@@ ol of Veterinary Sci@@ ences at the University of B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , said that it was not the first study to look at the importance of the left and the right in the can@@ ine species .
Last year , a team from the University of L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n discovered that dogs were turning their head toward the left when they watched an aggressive dog and the right when it was a jo@@ y@@ ous dog .
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Vic@@ tor@@ ia in Canada , he said : &quot; dogs go more easily to a ro@@ bo@@ t dog when his qu@@ e@@ ue brings to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study . ”
He said that the differences could come from the fact that dogs participated in different studies did not completely consider the animals of films or ro@@ bo@@ ts dogs as dogs .
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
&quot; Although many elements raised in different ma@@ m@@ m@@ als indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still have to be specified - and dogs are no exception . &quot; He said .
However , given the ease with which their behavior can be registered , it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other .
Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys postpon@@ es a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w because of the disease of Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner
The ro@@ ck group Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys has def@@ erred a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w after an ar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis diagnosis has been diagno@@ sed .
She@@ ff@@ i@@ ld &apos;s group was to take place on Friday in the concer@@ t room The Hy@@ dro@@ city in town .
However , his l@@ ar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis forced the sing@@ er Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner to re@@ program the show .
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concer@@ t to the L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a from Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham Thursday .
In a declaration on their official site , Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys said : &quot; Following the decision to postpone the concer@@ t to L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a from Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham tonight and after having asked for a medical opinion , Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ ke@@ ys must also postpone the show for the Hy@@ dro@@ ro of G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w on Friday 1 November . &quot;
&quot; Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner suffers from a lar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis and regrets not being able to happen in concer@@ t . &quot;
The show at L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham will take place on 20 November and the one in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w &apos;s Hy@@ dro@@ me will be held on 21 November .

Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will name his first Car@@ d@@ inal in February
Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will name new car@@ din@@ als of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22 , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an Thursday .
Car@@ d@@ inal are men to church the highest placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect him , so Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor .
There are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ d@@ in@@ als .
But as soon as a car@@ d@@ in@@ al reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer participate in the election of a Pope . This therefore comes back to a group of 120 &quot; voters &quot; .
In a declaration announcing the new , Fa@@ ther F@@ eder@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ ar@@ di , a spokesman for the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an , said that a meeting bringing together all the existing car@@ din@@ als would take place before the ceremony in which b@@ ish@@ ops will be raised to the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as the name To con@@ spir@@ acy .
&quot; Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is decided to communicate his decision to call February &apos;s cons@@ is@@ tia in advance so as to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of Car@@ d@@ inal from different parts of the world &quot; , said Lom@@ b@@ ar@@ di .
J@@ ack Val@@ er@@ al@@ o of Catholic Vo@@ ices said that by February , the number of voters voters will probably have fallen .
He said that a Pope in general called as many car@@ d@@ in@@ als as he had to so that the number of voters would reach 120 and as much Car@@ d@@ in@@ au as he wanted .
Next year &apos;s con@@ ist@@ y will be important because it will be the first since Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is &apos;s election in March this year , said Val@@ er@@ o .
For the moment , there is some kind of tendency to give priority to Europe and especially Italy .
&quot; It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will name the Car@@ d@@ inal from the rest of the world to restore the balance &quot; , he added .
40 % of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of Car@@ d@@ inal represent them .
The Car@@ d@@ inal will also be the first to be chosen since Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is formed the board of Car@@ d@@ inal , a group of eight Car@@ d@@ inal from all over the world responsible for looking at ways of reforming the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided alone .
&quot; From now on , Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is chose these eight car@@ d@@ in@@ als to help him &quot; , explained V@@ al@@ er@@ o .
He added that he was &quot; completely possible &quot; that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is requests advice to Car@@ d@@ inal .
But we have never known such a situation – she is completely new .
Val@@ er@@ o indicated that the bos@@ s generally raised b@@ ish@@ ops representing large communities in Car@@ d@@ inal r@@ ank , but that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is was &quot; full of sur@@ prises - so we don &apos;t know who will name &quot; .
G@@ M rec@@ alls some of his new p@@ ick@@ w@@ ps in the United States to repair the seats file
General Mo@@ tors C@@ o reminds about 19 000 of its new p@@ ick@@ u@@ ps Ch@@ ev@@ ros@@ let and G@@ M@@ C Sierra and G@@ M@@ C Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with the files that will be included manu@@ ally , according to a declaration on Friday of the American organization responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some pic@@ tu@@ ps , the seats before could present a default at the inc@@ lin@@ ation mechanism .
As a result , the files do not respect the federal safety standards of vehicles concerning the support .
&quot; If the vehicle is caught by the back , it may not be the case that the head@@ ac@@ he does not properly protect passengers , thereby increasing the risk of injuries &quot; , according to the declaration made on the National High@@ way Tr@@ ac@@ ic S@@ fe@@ et@@ ty Administration ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) .
The remembered models were built between August 1 and 10 September .
The deployment of G@@ M pic@@ tu@@ ps started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009 .
G@@ M informed the owners of the default in the first half of October .
The N@@ H@@ T@@ SA has not been able to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16 days judgment of government activities , which slow@@ ed down the growth of vehicle sales in October .
S@@ of@@ t sales Sil@@ ver@@ ado and Sierra , which were re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , increased by about 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , said G@@ M Friday .
In October , G@@ M sold 42 6@@ 60 p@@ ick@@ y@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and 16 50@@ 3 p@@ ick@@ ps Sierra .
G@@ M shares so@@ ared by 1.@@ 4 % to reach $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 on the New York stock exchange Friday afternoon .
A worker dies under concrete blocks .
A construction worker is dead under dozens of concrete blocks , Thursday the day before noon in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The drama took place at 11 : h on the street Mar@@ qu@@ et@@ te , near the inter@@ section of the street Be@@ au@@ well , in the r@@ oun@@ d-@@ up of Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La Pe@@ ry .
In all probability , work on the foundation was taking place in this place for some time .
A re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous foundation wall had just been erec@@ ted in the last few days .
The accident happened at a time when the victim had just arrived on the site to recover his tools .
I went to car and saw the wall collap@@ ses with a big mo@@ g of smoke , said Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who remains close to the site .
I &apos;@@ m lan@@ ded and I went to remove the big b@@ ric@@ ks that would recover it .
We only saw part of his back , it &apos;s so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an old man in the 50 or so working for a co@@ ff@@ ra@@ m company .
Re@@ anim@@ ation man@@ eu@@ vers were tried by emergency services , but without success .
M@@ an di@@ dn &apos;t survive his serious injuries .
A inspec@@ tor of the Committee on Health and Security of the Committee on Health and Security was dis@@ pat@@ ched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama .
A Obama vo@@ ter &apos;s cry of despair
I voted twice for President Obama , believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made some pra@@ is@@ e@@ worthy efforts with obstruc@@ tion@@ ism in the Republican Party .
obstruc@@ tion@@ ism does not excuse the difficulties of the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are site , nor the d@@ ron@@ es attacks
The memory of Obama ’ s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened .
N@@ ath@@ i@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is studying in the 2@@ n@@ d year of medicine at the Har@@ v@@ ard Medic@@ ine Medic@@ ine .
I &apos;@@ m in the process of reading a sad book these days .
It &apos;s a book that , I thought , would encourage me during the mor@@ sen@@ ess of the 2@@ n@@ d medicine year and give me hope .
He is called &quot; The Aud@@ ac@@ ty to W@@ in &quot; and he is the m@@ emo@@ irs of Barack Obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
When I ended up medical reports from my patients in the evening and I was la@@ ugh@@ ing , this book brings me back at the time when policies inspired millions of people and the speeches could cut you off .
The election ended with a land@@ sli@@ de victory and presen@@ ters of news news took the time to think about the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des m@@ our@@ n joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found .
A young team of vision@@ aries was moving toward the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama &apos;s transition period before taking office in 2008 , he had 82 % fav@@ orable opinions .
And then I close the book .
Re@@ turn to the present is a difficult re@@ aw@@ ak@@ ening , it &apos;s like leaving a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days of optimism , they are like a long time away , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change really took place in the years that followed the first time I voted .
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put to the credit of Obama great achievements , since the passage of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act ( affordable care law ) until the departure of Iraq from our army , passing through the end of the &quot; neither seen nor known &quot; and the murder of Os@@ ama B@@ in Lad@@ en .
Also , I think that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts aimed at moving our nation forward in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But having defended Obama &apos;s administration many times against my pe@@ ers and my colleagues , I can &apos;t give an explanation any@@ more .
I &apos;@@ m on the ver@@ ge of political despair .
Republican ob@@ struction can &apos;t explain the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
She can &apos;t explain that the National Security Agency collec@@ ts data on the privacy of Americans , nor the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers who reveal the government &apos;s mis@@ deeds .
She cannot justify the murder of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , neither the evasion of public funding and the over@@ spending of expenses during the presidential election .
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the &quot; more aggressive ... since the administration of Ni@@ xon &quot; .
And , more recently , she cannot excuse the im@@ possibility of design@@ ing a simple website for more than three years after the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able Law C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s what I expected .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preced@@ e it .
Obviously , the electoral function is not predictable , because the political opposition party and the events that happen by chance , like the New@@ ton massacre , influence our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That &apos;s what anno@@ ys me most .
I voted again for Obama in 2012 , but not because I was exc@@ ited by his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney presented a confused and un@@ refin@@ ed alternative that seemed not to be able to determine his policies or positions .
I felt that Obama , elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections , would get the promises that we had been hearing about for so long .
But while the fav@@ orable opinion index plun@@ ged below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to come back to 2008 through this book .
It makes me want the many promises that have so@@ ared .
This week , I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses for Clinton &apos;s Pri@@ may@@ lv@@ ania Pri@@ may@@ ors .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting , he told his team that they needed to return to the right path and remain true to their cause .
&quot; I want us to focus on our talent &quot; , he said .
We must remember who we are .
5 years later , Mr President , and I don &apos;t agree with you any@@ more .
The points of view expressed in this comment are only those of N@@ ath@@ i@@ el Mor@@ ris .
On Friday , at 3 o &apos;@@ clock , a violent col@@ lis@@ ion between a motor@@ cycle and a car took place in R@@ é@@ tin@@ ne at F@@ ér@@ é@@ on .
The late , J@@ on@@ a@@ than , 26 years old , from F@@ ér@@ é@@ on , w@@ as@@ n &apos;t wearing ca@@ ve@@ ats .
Despite the rapid emergency intervention , he died during this fron@@ tal col@@ lis@@ ion .
C@@ live Pal@@ mer claims that M@@ P Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest about the Pa@@ ren@@ tal leave system .
The deputy bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire C@@ live Pal@@ mer argues that Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest about the Pa@@ ren@@ tal leave system because his girls could be pregnant and enjoy this system .
The mining of mining , which challenges the payment of a carbon tax of 6 M M , has asser@@ ted this argument to try to remove questions concerning a possible conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding if carbon and mining taxes have to be deleted .
But Mr Pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s girls were ready personally to benefit personally from these policies .
&quot; He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his girls is pregnant , he will have a direct interest in the fact that she gets a leave or not , &quot; said Mr. Pal@@ mer .
Two months after his election , the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Pal@@ mer won the sie@@ ge of S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast of Fa@@ ur@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes , after re@@ counting .
Mr Pal@@ mer has put forward the idea of res@@ hu@@ ff@@ ling the stri@@ p system of votes to speed up the process .
Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s girls , Franc@@ is and Bri@@ d@@ g@@ let .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished ?
&quot; We need a better system &quot; , he said .
Why can we not have a system in which you can enter , seize your details in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6 : 30 in the next morning ?
Mr Pal@@ mer also criticized the use of paper pen@@ s to score votes .
Is it in order to be able to er@@ ase the result if someone does not agree ?
Today , having a paper piece of paper seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has studied the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for the S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he would take his new office &quot; very seriously &quot; .
The exercise of public functions is a public service issue .
&quot; We don &apos;t look for rewards , except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time &quot; , he added .
A bi@@ olog@@ ist team led by Wil@@ d@@ life Soci@@ ation Society in New York identified a new species of dol@@ ph@@ in to work off the northern coast of Australia .
Th@@ b@@ b@@ au@@ x B@@ ou@@ ou@@ x , responsible for the scientific mission to the Observ@@ atory and the A@@ ni@@ ail@@ s and Mi@@ locations Mar@@ ins ( O@@ C@@ EA@@ M@@ M ) comes back for Le Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Does the discovery of this new species of dol@@ ph@@ in surprise you ?
It &apos;s good news , but it doesn &apos;t surprise me particularly .
If in the past , species have been described and identified on mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ at@@ om@@ ical and geographical basis , today , the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of classi@@ fying species .
Moreover , it &apos;s not impossible for these genetic advances and m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology to challenge the classi@@ fications or belonging of a species of a kind of a kind , a family , or even an order .
At the beginning of the 19@@ th century , the mor@@ pho@@ lo@@ log@@ ists cl@@ assed animals , based on the mor@@ pho@@ logical differences between species .
Today , some of these ran@@ kings are called into question because of the progress of gene@@ tics .
Similarly , two species that are very close to mor@@ pho@@ logically have been distinguished thanks to gene@@ tics .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
A dozen years ago , the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-@@ family : the dol@@ ph@@ ins in the Pacific and the wh@@ ales at the Atlantic .
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species .
Why is it an important discovery , as the Wil@@ d@@ life Soci@@ ation Society said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences , in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic vari@@ ability .
If this population were already known for a long time by researchers , they di@@ dn &apos;t know that they were part of a new species , only present in this place .
So if a massive death problem caused by a vir@@ al epidemic or acci@@ dental capture arises in the region , we could deal with the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widely spread species on Earth .
This loss of genetic inher@@ it@@ ance would be much more problematic .
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of existing individuals on Earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it has to recover from its neighbors &apos; stocks .
As for the S@@ ous@@ a T@@ ous@@ a species , whose population of the new discovery is coming out , its stock has automatically become smaller , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ gene@@ ous , open housing , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This gen@@ tle bre@@ wing limits the creation of new species .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , more closed ecosystems favor genetic isolation , which can create the creation of new species in the long run .
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well known environment .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts on M@@ ars , than to know what lives in the grave of the Mari@@ ann@@ es , only 11 km from the sea surface .
We spend more money on the search for life on other plan@@ ets than in marine research and it &apos;s high time that it changed .
R@@ B@@ S suspen@@ ds two traders on the exchange market .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders of its exchange market division according to two other sources of the file , which shows once again that the international investigation of the suspic@@ ions of manipul@@ ations of the currency market is starting to bear fruit .
Some of the biggest banks in the world , especially U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys Bank , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they work with the supervis@@ ors in the investigation into the most important financial market in the world , where $ 5.@@ 3 tril@@ li@@ on-@@ dollar change each day .
Both traders are R@@ B@@ S employees to be suspended in the context of expanding the investigation that echo@@ es the scandal of manipul@@ ations of the inter@@ bank rate Lib@@ or .
The bank , which refused to comment on the suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month having received requests for information from the regulators .
&quot; The ongoing investigation on this case goes on and we work fully with the F@@ C@@ A and the other supervis@@ ors &quot; , said a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the file said that R@@ B@@ S had transmitted em@@ ail@@ s and in@@ stant messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , the British supervis@@ or , the Fin@@ al Con@@ du@@ t@@ ty Authority .
This tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 and would have been suspended from his post as a European official of tram@@ pling for the currencies of J@@ P@@ P@@ organic .
Ro@@ han Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , the European official of the exchange rate trading at C@@ it@@ é , was released this week , while Mat@@ t Gar@@ d@@ in@@ er , senior currency tra@@ der at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and U@@ B@@ S , was suspended by St@@ and@@ ard Char@@ ter@@ ried this week .
None of these traders has been accused .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s file included in@@ stant messages sent and by bankers working at Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ ti@@ group , added sources close to the file .
U@@ B@@ S this week explained that she had taken action against some of her employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , said he was investigating suspic@@ ions of manipul@@ ations of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities – the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , the authority of su@@ is@@ se competition su@@ is@@ se , the F@@ C@@ F , the American Department of Justice and the Hong Kong monetary authority . Ex@@ c@@ use claims made about bankers who would have agreed to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market . .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ P@@ org@@ an and C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland also launched internal surveys or received requests for information from supervis@@ ors , indicated sources close to the file .
The banks are sp@@ itting out in@@ stant messages and em@@ ail@@ s sent for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
news about these surveys has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth of investment banks in recent years , but which has been called into question this year because of the low exchange of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers tried to down@@ play the case by saying that it &apos;s almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast exchange of exchange rates highly liquid , but the bos@@ s sen@@ sed that this is@@ n &apos;t necessarily true .
A senior tra@@ der said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the frag@@ ility of liquidity between the trade management platforms and the increasingly frequent use of banks on their own internal platforms &quot; explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market . little expenses &quot; .
The news came on the same day when C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland announced that it had sent a tra@@ der working in his office for the funds negotiated on the London stock exchange this week after it caused a $ 6 M loss at the end of last year .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and worked with the supervis@@ ors .
&quot; We are convinced that the tra@@ der has acted alone and that the affair has been ma@@ stered &quot; , indicated a representative of the C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it Switzerland .
The investigation into May@@ or Ro@@ b Ford has been bot@@ ched , supports a lawyer .
After the police confirmed having put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Ro@@ b Ford f@@ uc@@ king the cr@@ ack , M@@ e C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by has supported having never seen a &quot; such bot@@ tle investigation . &quot;
M@@ e Ru@@ by said believe in La Pres@@ se Canad@@ ian that the police had &quot; ignored or minim@@ ized &quot; evidence against the may@@ or .
On Thursday , the police arrested the occa@@ sional friend and driver of Ro@@ b Ford , Alex@@ and@@ r Lis@@ i , aged 35 , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion relative to the video .
Alex@@ and@@ re Lis@@ i , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police said to have also observed this man delivering par@@ c@@ el to Ro@@ b Ford , indicating new court documents .
M@@ e Ru@@ by has called the fact that the police have never sear@@ ched the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford or his home , or put on listening to his phone , arguing that the police chief Bill Blair chose with knowledge not to act against the may@@ or .
Under the law , the police , having seen suspicious transactions in their own hands , could very well have inter@@ cep@@ ted the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford , arre@@ sting the may@@ or , and carrying out a search - even without a mandate .
She could also have requested an in@@ stant search mandate , if deemed necessary .
The police chief did not comment , but his spokesman Mar@@ k P@@ u@@ gas called the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by called &quot; obvious and desperate &quot; to assert himself to the media in a case that doesn &apos;t concern him in any way .
In the press conference , Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be &quot; reasonable reasons &quot; that could lead to the tabling of a criminal accusation against the may@@ or .
European Bour@@ b@@ ons declining at the middle of the sitting , except London
With the exception of London , the main European stock markets are moving down Friday in mid-@@ sitting , m@@ asked by some news of disappointing companies , while W@@ all@@ -@@ Street is expected to increase .
Moreover , investors remain careful because they think that the US Federal Reserve could un@@ settle its policy of Q@@ E earlier than expected .
Con@@ ver@@ sely , after the announcement of an inflation of 0.@@ 7 % for the entire euro zone , the idea is spreading among the market players that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street pres@@ ses an up@@ surge of US actions rising , after two con@@ secu@@ tive sessions of withdrawal .
To values , Rena@@ ult ( -@@ 4.@@ 63 % ) has the strongest record of CA@@ C 40 , m@@ asked by the warning on the result of its partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor Friday .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) marks the worst performance of Euro@@ st@@ 300 , after also having published declining results this morning and announced the internal creation of a dis@@ h@@ ing structure ( &quot; bad bank &quot; ) ) bringing together 38 billion p@@ ounds of the most risky assets . O@@ h , I don &apos;t care about it .
For its part , V@@ od@@ af@@ e ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) remains in the forefront of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 increases in reaction to press information that AT &amp; T studies a possible takeover bid .
On the exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the monetary policy of the ECB is good , as John Har@@ dy , strate@@ g@@ ist at Sa@@ x@@ o Bank , testi@@ fies .
The unique mandate of the ECB has always been inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reasons to act at next week &apos;s meeting .
We anticipate a high potential reduction of the euro .
In this context , the euro is continuing its re@@ treat against the American currency and has reached a lower level of two weeks to 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 dollar .
These same gu@@ ys support the euro zone bond market in the opposite direction .
The Supreme Court valid@@ ates Obama &apos;s reform law .
Great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court has today declared that Obama &apos;s reform law is a constitutional one .
By 5 votes against 4 , judges valid@@ ated the individual mandate of the P@@ ati@@ ent protection and Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act ( law on the protection of sick people and affordable care ) - which demands that citizens subscribe to health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they have to pay a fine - and have said it was constitutional under the government &apos;s power of tax .
The president of the Supreme Court , John Rob@@ er@@ ts , has r@@ alli@@ ed to the four most liberal members of the Court , while judges S@@ c@@ ali@@ a , Thomas , A@@ li@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy expressed their disagreement .
The Court also valid@@ ated the other sections of the law of 2 700 pages pages and also considered that the provision of the health system reform law , which states that the threshold of the election threshold should be low@@ ered , otherwise all the federal funding of the program would be lost , was coer@@ cive in line with the constitution .
The procedure to block the law has been committed by 26 states and the National Federation of Industry .

Pol@@ lu@@ tion between the Palestinians and the Israeli on the border of Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers w@@ ounded on Thursday , 31 October 2013 at night during a violent h@@ all at the border between Gaza and Israel , the most serious event in the Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza stri@@ p stopped functioning on Friday 1 November after its fuel stocks bur@@ st , announced the Energy Authority of the en@@ cla@@ ve Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve .
A local comm@@ anders of the Bri@@ g@@ ade Bri@@ g@@ ade Bri@@ g@@ ades , K@@ hal@@ ed Ab@@ ou B@@ ak@@ r , and another context of the army arm of Hamas , R@@ ab@@ i@@ e@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a t@@ ank sho@@ oting sh@@ r during an en@@ ac@@ tment of the Israeli army at the is K@@ han Y@@ oun@@ ès , in the south of the Gaza stri@@ p , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials of the Al@@ -@@ Q@@ assa@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ade Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ ass@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ ou@@ d , found the death when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four fighters were driving a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
An attack on a tunnel du@@ b@@ bed by the Palestinians .
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli t@@ ank and a bl@@ un@@ ded bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ er made an injec@@ tion of a hundred me@@ ters inside the territory before leaving later .
The confrontation lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , a spokesman for Hamas , Sam@@ i Ab@@ ou Z@@ ou@@ ha@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &quot; her@@ oes &quot; and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found their death during the confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of al-@@ As@@ sa@@ am who fell by defending the territory during a cur@@ sion of the Z@@ ion@@ ist occup@@ ier at K@@ han Y@@ oun@@ ès .
Several enemies were killed and w@@ ounded during the operation .
&quot; Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &quot; , threatened the spokes@@ person .
For its part , the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a wide tunnel fu@@ elled in Israeli territory since the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , discovered on 7 October and destined , according to the army , to &quot; terrorist activities &quot; .
Hamas claimed the use of tun@@ n@@ els to fight against Israel , specifying that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation aimed to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military communi@@ qu@@ é .
During the operation , Hamas triggered an explosive sla@@ p in the face of the T@@ Sa@@ h@@ al forces ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israeli At@@ t@@ acks in northern Syria
&quot; This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians &quot; , also indicated the spokes@@ person of the army Peter L@@ er@@ ner .
On the other hand , Israel has hit a military base in the north west of Syria aimed at a ship@@ ment of missiles destined for Lebanon &apos;s Shi@@ ite Shi@@ ite movement H@@ iz@@ bollah , on Thursday 31 October the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite channel .
An American official confirmed a &quot; Israeli strike &quot; but did not give details on the target .
&quot; In the past , the targets were missiles transferred to iz@@ ure &quot; , he just added .
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
Ci@@ ties with &quot; exclusive sources &quot; that she di@@ dn &apos;t name , the Saudi capital channel indicated that &quot; the bombing targeted a ship@@ ment of sol@@ -@@ air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon &quot; , referring to the powerful Shi@@ ite movement Lebanon that fight the rebels alongside Syria &apos;s forces .
Ear@@ lier , a Syrian NGO , the Syrian Observ@@ atory of Human Rights , reported several explo@@ sions heard on Wednesday at the d@@ aw@@ n of an air defence base at S@@ on@@ ar J@@ ab@@ é , near L@@ att@@ qui@@ é , on the coast of Syria .
This organization based on a network of milit@@ ants and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of explo@@ sions .
Go@@ ing back to black and white for Mari@@ e Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , who is present at Dan@@ se Dan@@ se , her two new group ch@@ or@@ us ch@@ or@@ us : the first inspired by Hen@@ ri Mic@@ ha@@ u &apos;s p@@ res and po@@ ems , the second injec@@ tion by the famous so@@ lo@@ s of pi@@ ano G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ opa@@ que . De@@ ath of S@@ diplomacy .
A evening that allows us to see all the pr@@ ism of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , of art to the ti@@ ps and the black of ink in the white .
A white scre@@ en serves a fundamental wall .
On the car@@ pet , white as well , in the huge space that is the The@@ at@@ re M@@ ai@@ res@@ e , goes ahead , profile , end like a black line and clo@@ thes , a body .
On the scre@@ en , a ink from Hen@@ ri Mic@@ ha@@ u is planned .
The body , simple , takes shape .
And this form will be that of the entire coin : a physical im@@ itation of physical im@@ itations of draw@@ ings .
The d@@ anc@@ ers , completely d@@ ressed of black , only the hands and un@@ discovered face , expect from each side of the game area , rush when the next grap@@ h appears , emb@@ ody it , come out in the news .
This black and white game of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ ha@@ au@@ x is being made by so@@ lo@@ s , in group in un@@ ison ( a mass that does sol@@ o ) , in a large group of 12 so@@ lo@@ s where everyone ex@@ ec@@ utes his sign .
We think about &quot; G@@ l@@ ori@@ de in the morning &quot; where , in sol@@ o , Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard was carrying out a series of ch@@ or@@ ical tasks written on car@@ t@@ els , posted online in the front stage .
It &apos;s the same principle , a giant P@@ ow@@ er@@ Po@@ int version .
Here the music is strong , it &apos;s strong , electric gu@@ ys and gu@@ ys .
Energy is high , the pace is always fast .
There will be a break when Car@@ ol Pri@@ or takes refuge under the d@@ ance of d@@ an@@ cing , to hand out , hand in hand , without so@@ ber or restraint , a part of Mic@@ ha@@ u &apos;s po@@ em , Mon@@ o@@ de and Mon@@ ot@@ one in sh@@ ou@@ ting , and will continue by d@@ an@@ cing .
And the music to leave , and the sequ@@ ence to resume .
This sound and energy discharge , long , if it &apos;s possible , ends up d@@ wel@@ ling and eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ing .
Like the regul@@ arity of the visual r@@ hy@@ th@@ m as well .
There are some nice f@@ uc@@ ks - the creation of images has always been a force at Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard - like these ha@@ ir who gets bo@@ gged down or these black tissu@@ es that pro@@ lif@@ er@@ ate the lines .
But the ch@@ or@@ leg@@ rap@@ ic approach lacks composition .
We get the impression that the ch@@ or@@ é@@ rap@@ he , instead of going to the meeting of Mic@@ ha@@ u &apos;s work , has imposed himself , with her ti@@ ps .
Re@@ sul@@ t : the bodies seem to be fl@@ at in front of draw@@ ings .
The c@@ uc@@ ks of Mic@@ ha@@ u , like G@@ es@@ tal@@ t forms , open up a larger and gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic imag@@ inary than the d@@ ance , which is more por@@ ous .
Only the end , in negative , with its d@@ an@@ cing d@@ an@@ gers ha@@ c@@ ked by a str@@ ob@@ o@@ cop@@ ic light and white signs in a suddenly black theat@@ re , touch magic .
The public liked , the welcome was warm .
The G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ opa@@ ths , after the en@@ act , is richer .
The scene is partly flags of Gre@@ y , d@@ anc@@ ers and pi@@ ano are covered by tissu@@ es , like fur@@ nit@@ ure in a neglected house .
At the pi@@ ano , d@@ an@@ gers were rela@@ ying to play the side@@ lines .
Their tou@@ ch@@ y music , tou@@ ching music gives real frag@@ ility .
On the scene , spend couples , in love du@@ os , very sen@@ sel@@ ess , even ero@@ tic .
Lab@@ or of group , small transi@@ tions , inter@@ c@@ inter@@ s that move around , shocking , writing is less bin@@ ary .
S@@ ho@@ ff@@ ers appear , as familiar with Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , running the red no@@ se , in love par@@ ades that are very pol@@ ari@@ zed .
The mo@@ res are car@@ n@@ as@@ ers , smo@@ kes or players .
Me@@ et@@ ings , la@@ ugh@@ ter and sh@@ ou@@ ting sh@@ ou@@ ting trans@@ pose the ar@@ cha@@ ic , gr@@ ace and ridiculous of the bodies in co@@ ot , people who are based .
But the coin takes its real flight after sal@@ vation .
A c@@ lown comes back in stage when the public leaves .
In this case , everything becomes permitted : the fourth wall falls , the uni@@ verse explo@@ ded are super@@ se@@ ded , the bo@@ om@@ ers d@@ an@@ ced , come out among the spec@@ t@@ ators , g@@ lo@@ be , smoke , by@@ pass , play with codes of the applause , stret@@ ches the sa@@ u@@ ce in a highly calculated mess . I &apos;@@ m still a senior su@@ ffe@@ l .
Jo@@ joy and mad@@ ness trans@@ pi@@ fy , and it &apos;s the art of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , there , to contaminated the public .
Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g and Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i are subject to legal proceedings concerning Nor@@ tel patents .
The group that own@@ s thousands of former patents . Nor@@ tel , started an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of patents on patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers , especially Google , the company he ha@@ ir@@ ted at the post sale of patents that took place after the Nor@@ tel bankruptcy . .
Ro@@ ck@@ star , the cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um that acquired the patents Nor@@ tel for $ 4@@ .5 M@@ d , lod@@ ged a complaint against Sam@@ sun@@ g Elec@@ tr@@ ics C@@ o L@@ t@@ d , H@@ T@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for patents in front of the As@@ se@@ de Court . United States in T@@ ex@@ as .
Ro@@ ck@@ star is held jointly by Ap@@ ple , Micro@@ soft , Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , E@@ ric@@ sson and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of having violated seven patents .
Pat@@ ents contain technologies that make it possible to display an adverti@@ sement related to the terms of research on the Internet , have indicated the conclusions of the trial , which is the job of Google .
It was not possible to join representatives of Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ ck@@ st@@ r .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and H@@ T@@ C make tele@@ phones that work under Google &apos;s An@@ dro@@ id operating system , which gives a f@@ ero@@ ci@@ ous competition to Ap@@ ple and Micro@@ soft mobile products .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of $ 900 M for Nor@@ tel patents .
Google has increased its offer several times , and finally offer $ 4.@@ 4 M@@ d .
After losing Nor@@ tel patents in front of Ro@@ c@@ k@@ st@@ r , Google has later acquired Mo@@ tor@@ ola Mob@@ ile for $ 12@@ .5 M@@ d , a market partially based on the Mo@@ tor@@ ola patent libr@@ ary .
&quot; Although he failed in his attempt to acquire patents in question during auc@@ tions , Google violated and continue to violate the so-called patents &quot; , indicated the conclusions of the trial .
Ro@@ ck@@ star calls for damage and higher interests against Google , because it claims that Google &apos;s patents violations are stub@@ born , according to the complain@@ ant .
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion of a house in G@@ es@@ ves : a defec@@ tive water heat .
The grand@@ mother would have lit a cigarette during a gas le@@ ak .
The explosion of an housing in G@@ es@@ ves , which made two serious w@@ ounded on Friday morning , a grand@@ mother of 52 and his 5@@ -year grand@@ son , is due to a gas flight from a defec@@ tive water heat , indicated on Friday night the replacement of the Ro@@ i public prosecutor .
The expert dis@@ pat@@ ch on the spot ensures that the origin of the explo@@ sions is purely acci@@ dental .
The grand@@ mother lit a cigarette while there was a gas flight and accumulation of gas .
The vital prog@@ no@@ sis of both victims is still committed .
The grand@@ mother was projec@@ ted by the explo@@ de and was seriously bur@@ ned .
The little bo@@ y , who stay@@ ed at his grand@@ father and his grand@@ father , was on his side and was bur@@ ned slightly slightly .
&quot; Both victims were in@@ tu@@ b@@ bed and long condi@@ tioned on the spot before being taken to Li@@ è@@ ge &apos;s C@@ ar of Li@@ è@@ ge , she in an am@@ bul@@ ance hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , &quot; specified the bour@@ g@@ ast@@ er tre José Paul@@ et , des@@ cen@@ ded on the scene .
Tr@@ ust , the grand@@ father was on the floor at the time of the explo@@ de .
Wa@@ it and except , he was able to join the land@@ sli@@ de by the st@@ as@@ lier remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed .
The grand@@ father and ten@@ ant of the neighb@@ oring house , fragile by the explo@@ de , were re@@ located by the president of the C@@ P@@ AS@@ S .
An@@ ne &apos;s fire@@ men from An@@ ne and N@@ am@@ ur and the police of the Ar@@ ches have intervened .

Egypt asks the first freely elected president to lend .
Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si l@@ ent the inaug@@ ur@@ ation of inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture , but it &apos;s unlikely that his day of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ e marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt .
The Islamic Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si promised the rise of a &quot; new Egypt &quot; when he l@@ ent the inaug@@ ur@@ ation of the presidency to the presidency , thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeded of H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak who was hun@@ ted from power 16 months earlier .
During his inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture in front of the High Constitutional Court , Mr. Mor@@ si has also become the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ archy 60 years ago .
He s@@ wor@@ n in front of the 18 judges in the black court of the Court . The building located on the N@@ il was built to look like an Egyptian temp@@ le .
&quot; We want better tomorrow , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public &quot; , declared President Mor@@ si during the formal ceremony broadcast live on public television .
&quot; Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom , real democracy and stability &quot; , explained Mr. Mor@@ si , a 60 year-old engine@@ er in the United States , from the Muslim Bro@@ thers , a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal and hard-@@ pressed organization . re@@ pressed by successive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11 hours , local hours , followed by a small con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred f@@ ans had gathered before the Court to che@@ er the new president and , moving away from the presidential fasc@@ ists of the H@@ os@@ ni years , traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage from his con@@ voy to the very frequ@@ ented streets linking the city centre to the southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
S@@ een like the un@@ char@@ is@@ matic &quot; rescue wheel &quot; of the Muslim Bro@@ thers , his personal prestige has strengthened considerably since his victory and Friday speech during which he tried to port@@ ray himself as the candidate not only of Islam@@ ists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President H@@ os@@ ni H@@ os@@ i .
&quot; Egypt is today a civil , national , constitutional and modern state &quot; , said Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , in blue suits and red co@@ stu@@ me , addressing the judges present in the or@@ che@@ str@@ ated bo@@ is@@ ter room where he l@@ ent o@@ ath .
Lat@@ er , Mr. Mor@@ si went to the Cairo University where he gave his inv@@ es@@ ti@@ ture speech .
He was officially ho@@ sted by a military fan@@ fare who played the national an@@ them while he was putting himself in the gar@@ den .
The ma@@ re@@ ch@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ ou@@ i attended the ceremony .
On his arrival , he was gre@@ eted by the s@@ ong &quot; The people and the army , hand in hand ... &quot; en@@ gen@@ dered by thousands of people gathered in the great university amp@@ hi@@ theat@@ er .
F@@ ull in 19@@ 08 and a former bas@@ tion of secular education , the university of Cairo later became a str@@ ing of Islamist student groups in the 1970 &apos;s .
Mr. Mor@@ si made an o@@ ath on Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r place , where the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak last year , and jury to recover presidential powers , including the military council , which replaced the former president , ou@@ sted , has deprived him .
But by agreeing to lend officially to the Court , rather than in front of Parliament as it is used , he is pr@@ one to the army &apos;s will by showing that the fight for power is not over .
Mr. Mor@@ si &apos;s speech in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r place accompanied spectacular populist actions .

The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weigh@@ ed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October , show the figures published by the manufacturers on Friday , five of the six main have performance performance lower than expectations .
The three big De@@ tro@@ it buil@@ ders show two numbers growth compared to October 2012 but only General Mo@@ tors did better than expected .

The police were not in a position at the moment to give information about the identity of the victims and their possible political aff@@ ili@@ ation .

In a communi@@ qu@@ é , his club said &quot; very disappointed &quot; , considering that his appeal was entirely justified .

Did you think that travel agents belong@@ ed to the past because of the Internet ?
F@@ light C@@ enter seems to reverse the trend .
society has changed its net profit forecast and hopes for record results thanks to ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ makers in Australia and the United Kingdom .
The travel agency is now expecting an underlying profit for the entire exercise located between $ 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 M before taxes , against a previous forecast of 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 M .
If current predic@@ tions are reached , it will represent 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record profit of $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 reached in 2011 / 12 .
The director General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ light C@@ enter had made 8 % profit in the first sem@@ ester and that the second sem@@ ester had started in strength , especially regarding travel other than business tri@@ ps in Australia and the United Kingdom .
&quot; Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are well on the way to making record results on the whole exercise before deduc@@ ting interest and taxes . &quot; He said .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits .
In Australia , the leisure tri@@ ps sector went back during the second sem@@ ester , which made it possible to compensate a domestic market for business tri@@ ps in light .
Similarly in the United Kingdom , F@@ light travel travel tri@@ ps have produced good results while business customers have spent less .
His subsidiary in the United States got back his losses during the first sem@@ ester where seasonal demand is lower and had to benefit from the whole exercise for the third time in a row .
The actions of F@@ light C@@ enter have increased by 3 c@@ ents to reach $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
In@@ known str@@ ang@@ ers sho@@ ot on a ho@@ tel near the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid
In@@ known str@@ ang@@ ers have opened fire this Friday on a ho@@ tel close to the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid py@@ ra@@ mid without making victims , as a result of an apparent qu@@ arre@@ l with redundant employees .
The att@@ ack@@ ers took the flight , specified the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior , Police General Ab@@ del L@@ ati@@ f .

In English literature courses , students will have to study at least one piece of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic British fic@@ tion and a contemporary British fic@@ tion work of 19@@ 14 .
The examination will also present &quot; new texts &quot; to encourage a more diversi@@ fied reading .
A comb@@ ative literature and English language will be deleted .
From 2015 , students will have to pass an independent G@@ C@@ SE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and male programs tomorrow – the first subjects to be subject to a radical review .
It will change in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , O@@ f@@ qu@@ al , the Office of the Sur@@ ve@@ y Office , will un@@ ve@@ il a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of the structure of the G@@ C@@ SE , with a new rating system and less classes .
Speaking during the summer , Mic@@ hael Go@@ ve , Minister of Education , said that there was a &quot; broad consensus about the need to reform our exam@@ s system to restore public confidence &quot; by insisting that the G@@ C@@ SE would be &quot; more stimul@@ ant , more ambitious and more rigorous . &quot; .
Stu@@ dies show that English schools spend less time on m@@ ath@@ s ( 1@@ 16 hours per year , 3 hours per week during the school year ) than most other countries .
In comparison , Australia ’ s schools offer an average of 14@@ 3 hours per year , and the Singapore students do about 13@@ 8 hours .
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours of employment at the time to the m@@ the@@ ists , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the G@@ C@@ SE of deeper me@@ als - as well as the greater importance attached to the materials listed in international ran@@ kings - would probably encourage schools to guarantee more of them . hours of classes .
The program will put more emphasis on the &quot; real world problems &quot; , especially financial mathema@@ tics .
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July in this state and largely calling into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .

The president of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany , Di@@ e@@ ter Gr@@ au@@ mann , has declared himself shocked by this re@@ vel@@ ation .

What do you think about the Pi@@ y &apos;s ha@@ ir@@ d@@ res@@ ser ?
T@@ ell us what you think in the comments below .
It works in the mu@@ d , the jung@@ le and going through rivers to offer free medical assistance .
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es Tw@@ le dis@@ covers free healthcare in the villages of Cam@@ ero@@ on .
D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend in order to see hundreds of patients .
There are not many doctors in this country of West Africa , barely 1 for 5 000 inhabitants .
Vo@@ te here or via your mobile machine
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le is one of the 10 H@@ ér@@ os C@@ N@@ N from 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the 10 other her@@ oes , to elect him &quot; H@@ ér@@ o C@@ N@@ N of the year &quot; .
This person will receive $ 25@@ 0@@ ,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le watched his father sick of alter@@ n@@ ating times of conscience and reck@@ lessness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
Never before has B@@ w@@ el@@ le been injured in a car accident in 198@@ 1 near Y@@ a@@ un@@ é , Cam@@ ero@@ on &apos;s capital .
At first , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted an infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ em@@ at@@ om@@ as he was going to wear the sequ@@ els the rest of his life .
&quot; There were no neuro@@ sur@@ gical people in Cam@@ ero@@ on , &quot; said Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
We would have taken it abroad if we had enough money .
Instead , B@@ w@@ el@@ le spent years supporting his father in crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , so that he would get any treatment he could enjoy .
&quot; It &apos;s not easy , &quot; adds Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
You can leave the house at 5 hours , you get to the hospital to be the first , and you &apos;@@ re not the first .
There are a lot of patients .
People can die because they wait too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there are only 1 doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
And even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ ons could not pay the consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of the country &apos;s health expenses are carried out in the private sector .
&quot; The only problem they have is poverty &quot; explained D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
And because of poverty , they can &apos;t enjoy life .
Having seen his father and as many of his comp@@ at@@ riots suffer , the B@@ w@@ el@@ le was determined to try to change the course .
D@@ r@@ . Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his volunteers team have carried out more than 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge during the last year .
He became a doctor himself , working like sur@@ ge@@ ons v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar at the central hospital in Y@@ a@@ un@@ é .
And he created a non-@@ profit humanitarian association , AS@@ CO@@ V@@ M@@ E , which goes to rural areas during week@@ ends to provide free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped almost 32 000 people .
Almost every Friday , with 30 people , they get into fo@@ d@@ der after setting medical equipment on the ro@@ of and going through difficult areas to go to the villages that need help most .
The chance doesn &apos;t always follow them .
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or pi@@ ous paths .
But when they arrive , they are received as her@@ oes : the community organiz@@ es a party , b@@ ann@@ er and d@@ ance and offers them the best available housing .
In these villages , free healthcare is a good reason to celebrate , and D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le - with his great s@@ mile and his sp@@ y energy – is more than happy to join the f@@ es@@ tivities .
The next morning , the team starts to receive hundreds of patients .
&quot; We get 500 people on each visit &quot; , said Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
They sometimes live 60 km from the village , and they come to foot .
In this roaming hospital , various health care is provided .
Many people receive treatment against Mal@@ aria , TB , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive cru@@ t@@ ches , a pair of l@@ un@@ ted gl@@ asses or a free birth certificate – document necessary to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
T@@ on@@ ight , the practical team of simple sur@@ gical acts under local an@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
The operations are generally carried out in a school , a town h@@ all or a house ; after the intervention , the patient goes up and goes to the aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the elec@@ tro@@ gen group , the operation room and ster@@ ili@@ zation of the equipment , D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
It &apos;s a res@@ ounding pace , but the village mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans generally help the team remain motivated .
&quot; They kno@@ ck on stam@@ ps all night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work &quot; , explained Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
On Sunday , the team returns to town , tired but proud of the work she has done .
The group , composed of Cam@@ ero@@ on and medical students , carried out 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge during the last year , and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those who they come to help .
A man explained that the free operation he had experienced to treat a grass would allow him to work again .
&quot; This will change my future and that of my family &quot; , said man .
In addition to making this mobile hospital live and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on , D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le also works night in private medical firms around Y@@ a@@ un@@ é .
It &apos;s this second job , he explained , which finances at 60 % his association ; the rest is covered by private donations .
&quot; I don &apos;t know when he sle@@ ep@@ s &quot; , said K@@ diplomacy O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a medical student in the second year of D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a and volunte@@ er within the group of D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to lead these campaigns .
For medical students and nurses from nurses like K@@ diplomacy O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr B@@ w@@ el@@ le in his missions , it &apos;s an opportunity for learning on the ground that they don &apos;t have at home .
&quot; We were able to participate in operations to help pon@@ der the blood or pass the instruments to D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le &quot; , explained M@@ iss O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
It &apos;s not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in second year .
voluntary students pay in general their trip to Cam@@ ero@@ on , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
But once in Y@@ a@@ un@@ é , their pension , their transportation and education are taken care of by the doctor B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
&quot; It &apos;s a her@@ o , there &apos;s no doubt &quot; , said K@@ diplomacy O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the Cam@@ ero@@ on people is not close to getting out .
For D@@ r@@ . B@@ w@@ el@@ le , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ ping others to live happy while keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him a huge joy .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m so happy when I do this job &quot; , added Mr. B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
And I think of my father .
I hope he sees what I do .
Making people lau@@ gh and reli@@ eving pain are the reasons that lead me to do that .

The two France of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a
Per@@ ple@@ x , aca@@ demics have long strugg@@ led to define and loc@@ ate Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a .
Professor in amp@@ hi@@ theat@@ ers and the classes of classes ?
Without doubt , but highlighting her weak for the cross paths , S@@ c@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , the High E@@ tu@@ des .
Ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary of other people &apos;s works in his street office in the street G@@ as@@ on@@ -@@ Gal@@ li@@ mar@@ d ?
Indeed , but ignoring the hidden work and the sub@@ ter@@ minal writing of the ed@@ itor .
H@@ er@@ tier of the occupied he Fon@@ taine@@ b@@ lea@@ u Fon@@ taine@@ b@@ lea@@ u at the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my ?
Of course , but knowing that such a sac@@ red would not be able to replace the true ho@@ ly oil , that of the thesis , which happened .
They will@@ ingly recognised in him a great sh@@ it , anim@@ ator and feder@@ ator of their work , but to point out that he was not very willing to produce himself himself .
To this uncertain image the monu@@ ment of the &quot; Li@@ ve of memory &quot; , to which he attached his name , has also contributed .
The bad languages were able to see a huge market in chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with a lively and les@@ bian eye of er@@ u@@ dic@@ tion , but in@@ im@@ ably dil@@ et@@ te .
The two books published by Nor@@ a almost two years ago have already established that the person who went to not write had a lot and well written .
The book here should definitely give him justice .
Yet , once again , we find the temp@@ tations of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , intellectual v@@ ag@@ in@@ age , ju@@ bil@@ ation to be j@@ um@@ ped like a ap@@ p of one subject on the other .
But we quickly understand that the dispar@@ ate objects brought together in this book to such a beautiful title bring the bu@@ c@@ tor to one and the same passion : the one to discover the constituent &apos;s constituent of French identity .
Why these dramatic calls to national unity ?
I@@ d@@ entity : it &apos;s a concern of the time .
Only recently , we were collectively invited to give it a definition .
But in the per@@ va@@ sive spirit of our leaders then , the French identity was a g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine .
Only by deplo@@ ying accidents , and the case , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism requires , was given to the pre@@ fec@@ ts and sub@@ fec@@ ts , authori@@ zed interpreters .
The one from Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a is completely different .
He doesn &apos;t ask himself for an e@@ ternal fran@@ c@@ icity , he refuses to define himself .
An@@ aly@@ st about a familiar str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he hur@@ ts in a forest of symbols , stopped every step by a re@@ bus object , tor@@ mented with irrit@@ ating questions .
You &apos;@@ re born , who comes from the company itself : why , in a country that &apos;s so long inst@@ alled within its borders , so formerly char@@ ted and firmly made , are these dramatic calls for unity ?
They are so pressing , suggested by Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , that to avoid the distur@@ b@@ ance born of the dis@@ cor@@ d of French history .
Fran@@ cs and G@@ au@@ laws , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ac@@ s and Bour@@ gu@@ ign@@ ons , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the forces of division , here , are very old .
And the most emb@@ le@@ matic is obviously the one that f@@ lies in the face of national history .
From the sem@@ ism of the revolution , the French have two stories and they have two nations , a mon@@ arch@@ ist , the other revolutionary .
The second wanted the death of the first , but without being able to deny it . On the contrary , they wanted to find the sac@@ red and all the more gre@@ edy for unity and indi@@ visibility that she had cut off her head to the obvious and powerful embo@@ di@@ ment .
And , from this point of view , an inv@@ inci@@ bly bin@@ ary nation , shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , wor@@ ship and hatred of the revolution .
To make this unique of French identity feel worth it , nothing worth the four not outside of the H@@ exagger@@ one , so the American hi@@ re of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a could well be the heart of his book .
Because America and France have one and the other a revolution , written a declaration of rights , wanted to create a new society .
But the American col@@ um@@ n makes it better to under@@ score what is specific to us .
There , men who left their An@@ ci@@ en to England and had no need to care about it .
Here , m@@ asked men of an an@@ ci@@ en of an An@@ ci@@ en region , and all the more radical .
There &apos;s a consensu@@ al revolution when it s@@ owed drama and confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation .
There are some founding fathers who are still hon@@ ored , and here the revolu@@ tion@@ aries whose models are hard to do , and who have also killed themselves .
There is institutional con@@ stan@@ cy here , and here a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitutions , like many mistakes to be made and of tests to resume .
France that is going on , France that comes from it
However , there was a time when the French thought they could rec@@ ou@@ p the ro@@ bo@@ t te@@ eth of their history , and defeat the cur@@ se of the figure two .
At this I@@ I@@ I@@ e , central and creative moment , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a showed a lot of interest and ten@@ acity : welcoming those who then used to repair the revolutionary divide , teaching school children all that in former France was preparing to modern France ob@@ vi@@ ately and by proposing them . A united version of their history .
But this peaceful identity has only had a long time .
Here again it is in debate , mi@@ red by immigration of a new type , threatened by the rise of res@@ on@@ ative minorities , absor@@ bed in the European space .
The book therefore offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ it of France that goes and the circum@@ spec@@ t ske@@ t@@ ch of France that comes .
With , on top of that , the portra@@ it of the histor@@ ian , who should reserve some sur@@ prises .
We discovered that the railway worker was a cas@@ e@@ er .
The man of multiple cu@@ o@@ si@@ ties was turning , slightly obs@@ es@@ sively , around the same idea .
The man@@ tle of man@@ ure is at the center of the center .
And the one who tabled , more than half a century ago , a subject on the idea of nation , but had taken away from the initial exercise of the thesis , entr@@ ust us with , cu@@ m fat , that he will have ended up doing it .
Of course in a less well-@@ off form , more broken and more sub@@ tle .
But let &apos;s not dec@@ eive ourselves , just as binding .
Because much more than the imposed figure of university education , this is what says the internal necessity of a life .
A former hostage in Lebanon : &quot; The return is quite complex to manage &quot;
R@@ emo@@ ved in Be@@ ir@@ ut on March 8 , 1986 , with three members of his &quot; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &quot; team coming to film a demonstration by H@@ iz@@ el@@ ne , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released almost 21 months later , on 27 November 198@@ 7 .
Re@@ treaty since 2008 , he participated in 2004 for the creation of the hostage association &quot; U@@ se of the world &quot; , which he has presid@@ ed over for several years .
His main objective : to get the hostages to complain and to bring their hostage ta@@ kers before the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages of A@@ q@@ i ( Al@@ -@@ Q@@ ai@@ da in Islamic Maghreb ) Dan@@ i@@ el L@@ arre@@ be , Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry D@@ ol , Pi@@ er@@ re Le@@ grand and Mar@@ c F@@ é@@ re@@ t were released on Tuesday .
After medical exam@@ inations at the V@@ al-@@ de-@@ Thanks Military Ho@@ sp@@ ital on Wednesday afternoon , they were able , since then , to find their families .
And try , slowly , to resume the course of their lives .
&quot; The New Ob@@ ser@@ ver &quot; questioned Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ di@@ in , 62 years old , ex grand delay , reti@@ red since 2008 , president of the association of the world .
From the evening of your release , you were on the 20@@ h H@@ h of &quot; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &quot; .
What are your memories of your release ?
In particular , in Be@@ ir@@ ut .
When I &apos;@@ m released , I find myself in the co@@ ff@@ in of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it &apos;s black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ que .
He tells me &quot; we &apos;@@ re released &quot; , but I &apos;@@ m not sure , and tell me that we can still be killed .
We &apos;@@ re very exc@@ ited , but very tense too .
It &apos;s war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They put us on the edge of a tro@@ t@@ ch .
There are Syrian soldiers .
We then arrive at the site of the Sum@@ mer@@ land ho@@ tel where the press is present .
French people bring us to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
It &apos;s time for parents , family , friends , press ...
I remember taking a b@@ ath for an hour .
And having din@@ ner in T@@ -@@ shir@@ t to the French Em@@ bas@@ sy .
I also remember a short night to talk with Ro@@ ger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
The tension is still there because we have no means to evac@@ u@@ ate us to L@@ ar@@ n@@ ac@@ a Air@@ port in Cyprus .
Ar@@ ri@@ ved there in hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , we take a private plane that brings us back to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ ren@@ z@@ ara , where P@@ as@@ qua bo@@ asts .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
We &apos;@@ re going to Or@@ ly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
It &apos;s a bit brutal .
There is an incredible but@@ cher .
And many media .
When I left there there were three television channels .
I come back and there are lots of them .
The down@@ fall of the air@@ plane ra@@ id , the re@@ union with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely strong in emotion .
Between the airport and at home , many motor@@ cycles follow our car that R@@ at@@ cus@@ h@@ é leads .
The motor@@ ists get out to do photo@@ s and follow me up to my home where I have to do a bit of the police to prevent some of them from rising .
The media pressure is enormous .
It doesn &apos;t stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fa@@ ti@@ gue is so difficult to see .
We get out of a hole and we &apos;@@ re suddenly under media fire .
It &apos;s a bit complicated , a bit violent , quite complex to manage .
But we &apos;@@ ve done the hardest thing .
The night , I &apos;@@ m at 20@@ h , the next day too I &apos;@@ m on TV .
Then a kind of adjustment to life , very slowly , for one or two months that are a bit like vac@@ ations .
How happened to medical exam@@ inations and D@@ G@@ SE D@@ G@@ SE ?
I had the right to a first medical control in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The rest was done in V@@ al-@@ de-@@ de-@@ Thanks the following days , my return : radi@@ os , all kinds of exam@@ s and meeting with a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It &apos;s not a sitting that does everything but we know that we can count on him , remind him if necessary , that we are not delivered to ourselves .
It &apos;s part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostage ta@@ kers .
It was logical .
It di@@ dn &apos;t anno@@ y me .
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Ni@@ ger ?
I listen to what is said .
The debate about r@@ ans@@ oms in particular .
Some things anno@@ y me , others less .
I &apos;@@ m trying to distinguish between the questions about my past as hostage and my h@@ at as president of the association of the world , which allows me to distance myself from it , and seems to me to be much more interesting to deal with .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Above all , I am fighting , together with others , for the recognition of the legal status of hostage .
In my opinion , there is a problem with sem@@ an@@ tics .
We must call the taking of hostages to take hostages &quot; political &quot; - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice , complain and bring their hostage ta@@ kers before the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in comp@@ as@@ sion , in emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages could perhaps have access to justice too ?
A tribunal in The Hague is done for that .
Why do you not say to the hostage ta@@ kers &quot; you fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of war , like those of all the Geneva Conventions , we &apos;@@ ll be brought to justice &quot; ?
It seems to me , however , founded , legitimate , struck by common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to , and it shocked me .
It &apos;s my main fight .
Egypt ’ s Islamists in the street to denounce Mor@@ si ’ s trial
The anger is growing in the ranks of Egypt &apos;s Islamists .
Two days before the opening of the trial of the de@@ posed president Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took to the streets .
A mobilisation throughout Egypt to call for the rein@@ statement of the first democratically elected president of the country .
It &apos;s not a trial highlights this milit@@ ant of the Muslim Bro@@ thers .
Up to now no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunte@@ er has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case .
It &apos;s not a trial , it &apos;s a far@@ ce .
The trial of President Mor@@ si is a false trial . A pro-@@ Mor@@ si re@@ sto@@ res a pro-@@ Mor@@ si , it &apos;s he who is supposed to make S@@ is@@ i judge , not the opposite .
Mor@@ si must judge S@@ is@@ i for the massacres in Ra@@ ab@@ a@@ a , the massacres of N@@ ah@@ da , and the massacre of the Republican Gu@@ ard .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
clashes broke out in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police used te@@ ar gas , 60 protesters were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police will be deployed in front of the Police A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Cairo , where will Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si be judged .
H@@ ag@@ el critici@@ zes 9 American states for infr@@ inging homosexual rights .
Since the federal state recognized sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage , &quot; all soldiers of soldiers have a right to an identity card from the Defense Department and the benefits that come with &quot; , reminded the minister in New York in a speech in front of the An@@ ti@@ -@@ De@@ am@@ ation League to fight an@@ tis@@ emi@@ tism .
&quot; But some states refuse to issue these cards to sa@@ me-@@ sex partners in the National Gu@@ ard installations &quot; established on their territory , denounced , blam@@ ing these states for infr@@ inging federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these maps , these people can &apos;t benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases , or access their sto@@ res .
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the National Gu@@ ard leader , Fran@@ k Gr@@ ass , to ensure the implementation of federal law .
The front of the nine states started with T@@ ex@@ as that refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the T@@ ex@@ i@@ ane National Gu@@ ard , because of a conflict between the text text and the federal law on sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage .
He was joined in his refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ ppi , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Car@@ ol@@ ine and Western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defense officer .
The Pen@@ tag@@ on considers the population affected by the recognition of sa@@ me-@@ sex marriage to about 5@@ 600 active people , 17 000 by including the National Gu@@ ard , the reserve and reti@@ red people .

Organ@@ ized by the S@@ K@@ 8 Un@@ ity section of association B@@ um@@ p , the competition should bring together the best sk@@ it@@ ators in the region .
The en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment is taken on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 hours and the qualification stages will start after that , at 10 hours , before the final at 3 : 00 and the award of prices at 4 hours .
The public will be able to ad@@ mire the technical pro@@ w@@ ess of young people who , for some , already attend competi@@ tions at the highest level , like the young prof@@ li@@ g@@ ate of L@@ or@@ ren@@ z@@ o P@@ lu@@ m@@ bo .
At only 10 years , he has already conqu@@ ered his place this year for the Europe Cha@@ m@@ pion@@ ships in Copenhagen and he doesn &apos;t like anything as much as going back to competitors who exceed three heads .

We also think that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment .
A case of rage detected at a c@@ at in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise
Thursday , 31 October , the authorities announced that a case of rage had been detected at a ch@@ ate@@ on ch@@ at in the V@@ al-@@ d &apos;@@ O@@ ise , obviously of foreign origin while France is un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed from native cases since 2001 .
The Ch@@ it@@ on was found on October 25 in Ar@@ g@@ ment@@ il and he died on 28 October .
The rage diagnosis has been confirmed by the Pa@@ ste@@ ur Institute .
&quot; An epidemic investigation has been launched to identify and take care of those people who could have come into contact with this ch@@ ate@@ us between 8 October and 28 October included , &quot; precise the Ministry of Health and Agriculture .
&quot; Five people having been in contact with the Ch@@ ate@@ on have already been identified &quot; and received preventive treatment .
&quot; C@@ ome on man , the preventive treatment of human rage , managed after contact with the animal , but before the symptoms appear , is very effective &quot; specifies the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The departments are now calling the people who would have been dead , clo@@ g , emi@@ gr@@ ated , or l@@ acked on a mu@@ qu@@ ist or on a skin injured by this ch@@ ate@@ on or whose animal would have been in contact with this ch@@ ate@@ on between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0@@ 8@@ 1@@ 1@@ .@@ 1@@ 1@@ 1@@ th 0.@@ 0@@ 6 / 95 between 10 hours and 6 hours from 1 November .
&quot; Since France has been un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ed since 2001 , this ch@@ ate@@ on or mother were imported from another country , not un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed &quot; according to the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last case &quot; native &quot; of rage recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fo@@ x and that &quot; France is declared officially un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Animal Health ( O@@ I@@ E ) &quot; .
A case of rage on an un@@ law@@ fully imported chic@@ ken from G@@ am@@ bia was recorded in 2008 .
&quot; R@@ ies is a deadly disease if it is not dealt with in time &quot; , remind the departments and it is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear .
Obama is taking a step back on his reform of the health system .
Under an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday on his un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable and often repeated promise that &quot; if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it . &quot;
After that hundreds of thousands of people received res@@ on@@ ation opinions from their providers , the Republic@@ ans criticized the president in the last few days by acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
&quot; The vast majority of people with health insurance who can keep it &quot; , he said during a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
Speaking of what he calls &quot; a news story &quot; about the termin@@ ations , President Obama pushed Americans who received these opinions to seek new market insurance .
Most people will be able to get full health care schemes better adapted for the same price , or even for even less expensive than expected .
&quot; You will get out &quot; , he said .
The Administration announced that we should not be surprised if the 5 % of the population who themselves contract their insurance is forced to change regime because their coverage does not satisfy the new standards required under the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act .
&quot; Let me address directly to these Americans : you deserve better &quot; , said K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us when he testi@@ fied before the Committee on Energy and Comm@@ er@@ ce in Washington .
Mrs Se@@ be@@ li@@ us , who supervis@@ es the implementation of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act , indicated that the launch in October of the online market had failed &quot; la@@ ment@@ ably &quot; .
&quot; I &apos;@@ m frustrated and angry as anyone , &quot; she added .
I look forward to reg@@ ain@@ ing your confidence .
It &apos;s a K@@ ath@@ le@@ en Se@@ be@@ li@@ us ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated who gave this sentence , when she believed her micro@@ phone cut off , addressing a assist@@ ant sitting behind her during yesterday &apos;s session of the Assembly following an exchange of contentious points of view with B@@ ill@@ y L@@ ong , Republican representative of the M@@ iss@@ our@@ i , to know if she should join Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
For more than three hours , B@@ ill@@ y L@@ ong constantly insisted on Mrs S@@ be@@ li@@ us why &quot; the architec@@ t &apos; of the Af@@ for@@ d@@ able C@@ are Act did not voluntarily renoun@@ ce the government &apos;s insurance insurance to subscribe to a regime via He@@ al@@ th@@ Car@@ e@@ .@@ go@@ v , that it &apos;s it From now on millions of Americans .
C@@ ome on a special cas@@ que at Abu D@@ hab@@ i
The happy elected , J@@ an@@ ke P@@ re@@ ko@@ op , combined the col@@ ors of the car brand and the German flag , while integrating the no@@ tions of speed and heat at the level of the run@@ way .
The German S@@ bas@@ ti@@ an V@@ et@@ t@@ tel , qu@@ ad@@ dro@@ ple champion of For@@ mul@@ a 1 world world , en@@ du@@ red for the free tests of the Gr@@ and Pri@@ x of Abu D@@ hab@@ i Friday a special cas@@ que whose design was made by a Mexican f@@ an of 21 .
V@@ et@@ tel chose among 1@@ ,@@ 500 draw@@ ings sent from all over the world , within the context of a competition launched by one of the spons@@ ors , a car brand , of its stable .
He was invited to follow Abu D@@ hab@@ i &apos;s G@@ P , with a friend , and can therefore see the German champion , the run@@ way and in his stan@@ d .
It had to wear this hel@@ m on Friday and Saturday , on the tests .
It &apos;s probably that he will have another special cas@@ que Sunday for the race , destined to mark his 4@@ th con@@ secu@@ tive global title .
One inhabit@@ ant of Au@@ ber@@ vil@@ la@@ in laun@@ ches his sub@@ urban party .
Let &apos;s not be mistaken .
In the spirit of Ab@@ de@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , his foun@@ der , the &quot; sub@@ urban party &quot; addressed not only to ban@@ li@@ u@@ ters .
I chose a map of France as a lo@@ go , he &apos;s justified .
When I speak of sub@@ ur@@ bs , I address all those who are excluded from the great national family .
However , his project , presented on Thursday at the press conference in his municip@@ ality of Au@@ ber@@ vi@@ il@@ ers , was born out of the desire to better defend multi-@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , this great cultural po@@ t that is above all the neigh@@ bor@@ hoods .
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multi-@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , he says .
Ab@@ de@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ in , 50 years old , a Territ@@ orial attached , claims today as &quot; 100 % a@@ political &quot; even if he has not always been neutral .
M@@ ilit@@ ant in 2002 alongside Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ é@@ e , he then supported local Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in loc@@ ally between 2010 and 2011 .

John Ker@@ ry admitted without precedent that American sp@@ ying &quot; went too far . &quot;
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the defensive attitude of the United States vis-à-vis his surveillance programs by ad@@ mitting , without precedent , that on several occasions , sp@@ ying &quot; went too far . &quot;
The Secretary of State also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , governed on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations by whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about the N@@ SA &apos;s sp@@ ying activities has seen the light of day .
The lea@@ ks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an inter@@ govern@@ ment@@ alist conference in London by video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &quot; It &apos;s undeniable that the President , myself and other members of the government have known some things in an automatic mode because we had the possibility , as of the Second World War and until the difficult years of the cold war , then well S@@ sure September 11 . &quot;
Then he became the first high ranking member of the government of the United States to admit that American sp@@ ying had over@@ run , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : &quot; In some cases , it went too far wrong . &quot;
And the President is intent on trying to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : &quot; We live in a new world where people are ready to get out . &quot;
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , make them explo@@ de and attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they act ?
We did not prevent aircraft from falling , buildings to explo@@ de and people to be killed because we were able to read the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , American legislators will go to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American sp@@ ying affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States , Thursday explained the president of the Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y of Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ ut pointed out that he spoke to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the feeling of frustration generated by the monitoring of the National Security . S@@ tri@@ ke .
&quot; It &apos;s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay on our side in the mutual engagement in the fight against terrorism &quot; , has declared Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first term , and president of the sub@@ committee of European Senate of the Senate , during an interview since Washington .
And I &apos;@@ m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism , despite the anger caused by N@@ SA programmes .
The press reports that the N@@ SA has cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which has damaged relations with certain allies of the United States , however the director of the agency said this week that it was wrong and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about meta@@ data that NATO allies had gathered and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations have reported documents lea@@ ked by S@@ now@@ den according to which the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from the cell@@ phone phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state .
The director of the intelligence services , James C@@ l@@ ap@@ er , justified sp@@ ying on allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides .
In this atmosphere of tu@@ mul@@ t , Mur@@ ph@@ y indicated that his office was holding a cong@@ ress trip , which should take place this year , and that he was hoping that the delegation would include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
The names of the other participating legislators should be un@@ ve@@ iled in the coming days .
He said that the route was still to define .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the goal of this trip was to make it possible to improve relations , but also to be &quot; emotional firm@@ ness &quot; .
He explained that European heads of state had to be honest with their citizens about the type of sp@@ ying programs that they themselves apply for years .
&quot; We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only people in the world to make es@@ pion@@ age &quot; , has said Mur@@ ph@@ y .
Meanwhile , Ker@@ ry planned to go this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the bit@@ ch en@@ gen@@ dered by American strategies in Syria , Egypt and Iran , as well as the surveillance activities of the United States .

An Austr@@ ali@@ an calls for his prison sentence in Thailand .
A 21 year-old Sy@@ d@@ ney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison at P@@ hu@@ k@@ let for having wrongly claimed that he was attacked by a tax@@ i driver , appe@@ aled to the judgment and was released on b@@ ail .
Ste@@ life Ro@@ ch@@ el@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first deemed guilty by a P@@ hu@@ k@@ let P@@ hu@@ k@@ let Court of Pro@@ v@@ ince on 15 June , false statements after telling the Tha@@ i police that a local tax@@ i driver , accompanied by two other men who had control , had attacked him early on Sunday 10 June .
However , the recording of video surveillance later revealed that she was coming back to her ho@@ tel in safety after being separated from her little Australia friend .
P@@ hu@@ k@@ let police inter@@ rog@@ ated B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she admitted having invented the story of all parts .
She was held in a local office of the local commission before the audience before the court .
B@@ am@@ ford was sentenced to a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a low-@@ security detention center on the periphery of P@@ hu@@ k@@ let rather than in a women prison .
This is the gir@@ l of the former Australia &apos;s ru@@ g@@ by player ru@@ g@@ by player , who called the Foreign Ministry of Can@@ ber@@ ra to help his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told Sunday Te@@ leg@@ rap@@ h of Sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was &quot; extremely worried &quot; of the well-being of his daughter and wanted her to return to Australia .
&quot; We have obviously lived a anxious moment , but we hope to bring it back to the house safe as soon as possible &quot; , said Tun@@ ks .
B@@ am@@ ford called for the judgment and was released after a deposit of 50 000 b@@ its .
In Australia , the press said that in the meantime she was on vac@@ ation in the K@@ ra@@ bi region , south of Thailand .
Thailand &apos;s legal sources said that B@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local lawyer in P@@ hu@@ k@@ let , but warned that the call could lead to an increase in the penalty that could go up to two years imprisonment and a prison in a adult prison .
However , after the recent murder in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et of Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith , an Austr@@ ali@@ an travel@@ ler worker , Thailand could also seek to improve its image with tourists , which could lead to a acqu@@ it@@ tal .

Li@@ ving together in French , the challenge of the school commission Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ te@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ y@@ s
At the school commission Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ te@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ ys , 62 % of students have a mother tongue other than French .
This is what motivated , a year ago , a consultation with parents , students , teachers and members of the education staff , to think about how to better integrate students who live by several cultures .
The school commission has just un@@ ve@@ iled his vision of &quot; Li@@ ving together in French &quot; .
V@@ ision diversity has been around for a year in schools to help students of all origin discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language .
The discovery of neigh@@ bor@@ hoods , our architecture , our places are benchmarks .
Bi@@ g names of writ@@ ers , artists , whether they are sou@@ p or they have come from elsewhere .
Who are our buil@@ ders ?
&quot; So , we create projects so that they identify with everything &quot; , explains the president of V@@ ision diversity , A@@ id@@ a K@@ am@@ ar .
Michel V@@ en@@ ne , from the New World Institute , has identified several challenges for the school commission .
&quot; On the transmission , for example , of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c culture , the feeling of belonging , the support for staff in the trans@@ forma@@ tions we live in , he lists him .
The school commission Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ te@@ -B@@ our@@ ge@@ ys has created a research center that will give tools to teachers who too sometimes come from elsewhere .
