UK@@ IP who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example .
You talk about when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to do health tourism , and when , with that in mind , it answers yes when the inter@@ view@@ er asks him specifically if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted .
First of all you use speci@@ ous arguments , then you dis@@ credit them with a barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Every time I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we have to qu@@ e@@ ue behind intolerance to the chronic hypo@@ con@@ d@@ ri@@ e who thinks that all of them are owed to them .
I think it &apos;s you who use speci@@ ous arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the righ@@ t-@@ w@@ ing@@ ers , almost doesn &apos;t exist .
I think that is what we call democracy .
So no one would be affected by U@@ K@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
Only in the parallel uni@@ verse of U@@ K@@ IP can Car@@ sw@@ ell appear as a revolutionary .
A c@@ itation from a tor@@ ch@@ on is not proof .
Yes , let &apos;s sho@@ ot the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail di@@ dn &apos;t write the report , but only comment on it .
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality .
I don &apos;t think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You don &apos;t know anything either from my personal situation or from my identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
Far@@ age sentence has surprised a lot , but only because we &apos;@@ re so rarely talking about this problem .
He made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic comment .
You will have to succeed in putting it back to you .
I &apos;@@ m not sure where you want to come from , but I imagine you don &apos;t like when the media talk about what you don &apos;t like .
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Far@@ age and his dis@@ ci@@ ples . That@@ cher who thinks that AIDS and flood are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are something good , no .
Finally , the situation is as ro@@ tten in Ireland as it is in Spain .
With the new crisis that arri@@ ves the period of austerity .
S@@ tri@@ king almost 5 % of growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
Ireland is the EU@@ R@@ T@@ H@@ E T@@ I@@ Y The EU@@ R@@ EP@@ ER . We &apos;@@ ve been bo@@ asting about it , there are a few land@@ sli@@ des .
We knew the sequ@@ ence !
It starts again having read the article .
We are trying to make people believe that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that a N@@ O U@@ V@@ E M@@ IR@@ AC@@ E EC@@ O@@ O@@ M@@ I@@ Q@@ E is happening .
With the Brussels agreement , im@@ po@@ ts on the lowest soci@@ es in Europe , a flexible working march , which continues .
With these ing@@ ra@@ des , I don &apos;t know what to po@@ pp@@ y &quot; for the moment &quot; with the arrival of the Polish people .
In the 1980s of the 20th si@@ ec@@ le , it was ironic that one of the poorest countries of the union of Europe , with Portuguese , in considering a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without the inf@@ ants , the situation is always better than it was .
The Green was in front .
That their development is not a long quiet river , it is on the basis of recent dis@@ appointments .
T@@ ot@@ al im@@ po@@ ts the lowest in Europe ?
It &apos;s false !
Latvia has an im@@ po@@ t rate of 0 % on companies .
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on the im@@ po@@ ts who have been paid again by the multinationals .
If you believe a report that came out in 2008 or 2009 , they pay less than 5 % in France .
Only SMEs pay a lot .
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become bo@@ gged down again , and there are new cars ( and sh@@ it ) every corner of the street , exactly as before the 2008 crisis .
I live in Dublin for 14 years , the recovery is obvious in daily shops since the entr@@ ance .
Is it supposed to be economic news ?
D@@ on &apos;t worry , I &apos;@@ m sure the comments will soon inf@@ lame .
In another article they are in writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ ha@@ l A@@ str@@ a is involved in a c@@ up on the A@@ 140 .
Does R@@ y@@ an@@ air now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way ?
I think that O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon buy a whole new aircraft fleet , so a few bo@@ xes and radiation on the old ones will soon be forgotten .
That said , I &apos;@@ m voting with him next week , so I hope that it will not be on one of these people once they have managed to do so .
So it would be entirely from the fault of the other pilot .
Did R@@ y@@ an@@ air pay for passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to give them ?
But without this kind of Irish company , you could not allow you to go on vac@@ ation , young man
I never took R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the last 3 times I took the plane with B@@ A .
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service .
No , but it &apos;s R@@ y@@ an@@ air , so they can give their joy .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air triggered dozens of comments from people who would never pre@@ ach R@@ y@@ an@@ air for those who like to take R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay other than the basic price have only to blame themselves , etc .
It &apos;s pretty transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident .
I wonder what the delays will be and if you will have to compensate passengers and , if that &apos;s the case , if R@@ y@@ an@@ air will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake of the air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers in the airport .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers were placed in another plane in less than an hour , they have no right to compensation .
S@@ or@@ ry to dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to this British Air@@ ways flight that takes the English English I@@ SIS , not true , as you say .
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris , street of the Frank@@ s@@ s@@ our@@ o@@ is : the Mar@@ a@@ is is largely pedestri@@ an and literally group .
People don &apos;t come en m@@ asse for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( for the most part ) nor for the Sal@@ on in the jour@@ nal at the S@@ pace of B@@ lan@@ c@@ s-@@ Man@@ te@@ au@@ x ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly du@@ sty ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the sto@@ res are all open and the neigh@@ bor@@ hood is un@@ believ@@ ably alive and alive .
With many foreigners who spend ..@@ .@@ .
Do you think that the opening of Sunday will create jobs ?
G@@ o to Paris R@@ ue des Fran@@ cs Bour@@ geo@@ is where the shops are open the Sunday , bur@@ sting world with 50 % of tourists .
@ al@@ o@@ es F@@ au@@ x !
The only argument that seems to me to be admissible is that of zones receiving a large number of foreign tourists and nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they buy tax .
The tourist zones lose a considerable amount of turnover every year for the same reasons .
There remains the industry where expensive equipment , exploited on the Sunday , makes it possible to lower prices .
D@@ ed@@ ic@@ al rest is a right that benefits , except for exceptions , the employees .
That is why it is planned and regulated by the labor code .
Neither the minister responsible for the economy , nor , moreover , the one responsible for foreign affairs , have any powers to reform the labor code .
So they &apos;@@ re close .
The law serves what ?
To satisfy a portion of the population and companies that want to work on the Sunday .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al on Sunday , I take my small children to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my V@@ ille of 30@@ ,000 inhabitants where I live in France the Bi@@ b@@ li@@ o municipal is open 4 days a week but not the w@@ e !
That &apos;s what access to culture is ...
And it &apos;s also the regulation of working hours .
The way of life he defended with ten@@ acity against fascism
the way of life he defended ten@@ aci@@ ously against fascism and Bol@@ sh@@ vis@@ m
And if his daughter &apos;s sequ@@ el was , against his will , use to pay the inher@@ it@@ ance fees ?
There are pain@@ ts .
Some are good , other not terrible .
Maybe his succession would like his part of the ca@@ ke , if you pass me the expression .
His preference for a victory of nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And her en@@ m@@ ity with the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
I don &apos;t care either .
But for 5 years , and only for five years , it was perfect .
In 19@@ 40 he kept his government in mind who wanted to discuss a &quot; agreement &quot; with the Naz@@ is and he very sk@@ il@@ fully won .
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and his energy , he united the country in the idea that fighting F@@ as@@ c@@ ists was the only way to win .
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom , and of France , and Belgium and , in the end , the entire world , can thank God for having had during these five years , just these five years , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the bar and no other .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
That his des@@ c@@ endants sell pain@@ ts on the free market to get money from inher@@ it@@ ance costs , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to be able to ad@@ mire one in a mus@@ e@@ um , let them get the money to buy it .
It &apos;s as simple as that .
But we could use taxes .
No one can deny that when it was &quot; the moment of truth &quot; , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A revival of the internal market through public works will only help big companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by avoiding hi@@ ring , since infrastructure sites are by definition not renewable .
As for the social reforms recommended by the Minister , they really reflect the real evil .
Re@@ turn to pr@@ inc@@ e@@ us values .
Unemployment reform is not a contradiction .
That the smallest of us is not in need !
Either solidarity we help , either , he has D@@ R@@ O in exchange for the services he ren@@ ders or has made to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H that I prefer with s@@ mi@@ c corresponds to this vision .
There is also the bos@@ s who lives on the income of his properties .
We need to differenti@@ ate the one who in@@ ve@@ sts for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives with his ren@@ ts .
A good to rent even two for a couple above , it &apos;s vir@@ al
The little gen@@ i@@ us of Fin@@ n is sing@@ ul@@ arly lacking in imagination .
The new deal was a policy of major works , but at a time of major infrastructure .
Today , in Europe and France , it &apos;s not the case .
The developed countries are su@@ c@@ ked .
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way could a new deal be a solution .
Especially at a time when the question of de@@ growth is emerging in response to a recession that is only wild growth , so it &apos;s so brutal .
You would have been right 30 years ago : more need ( or possibilities ) of dam@@ s , coal mines , high@@ ways ...
But if we want to make the future cli@@ mat@@ o-@@ energy shock less ru@@ ined , then the need for investments is obvious : insul@@ ation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transportation and storage of energy etc ...
A tax that fav@@ ors high income and whole r@@ ings .
Who is in power ?
Ob@@ s@@ essed by the smar@@ t@@ phones .
Charles Ar@@ th@@ ur is really a gal@@ op@@ in .
The benefits of Sam@@ sun@@ g are damaged by the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 and its competitors on the same range .
The mid-@@ September introduction by Ap@@ ple scre@@ en@@ er control for i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 and 6 more has perhaps se@@ duc@@ ed for bu@@ yers who otherwise would have bought a Gal@@ ax@@ y
I tried all these phones and decided for L@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a cli@@ ent , but not for Ap@@ ple .
I think it &apos;s essential for us to have an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft put in place this philosophy , we experienced a decade of stagnation that has finally been broken by Google , Ap@@ ple and the source community .
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development .
In addition , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
For me , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple , because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design .
Some people do not attach any value to design , for them the options , func@@ tionality and price pri@@ zes .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
Let &apos;s stop looking for &quot; a better platform &quot; .
Are there &quot; a better car manufacturer &quot; , not really , they are different but similar .
I would like to see a thri@@ ving port@@ able industry , with radically different approaches for different people and markets .
It &apos;s safer and must be encouraged .
This is in all our interests .
I &apos;@@ m happy that you found exactly what you were looking for and that it &apos;s not Ap@@ ple &apos;s product , even if I made a different choice .
Most of the people I know have i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
Our Ukrainian friends who , according to one of them , fight the ideas and not men ( on the contrary , well on Paris b@@ ob@@ os ) could tell us what ( the ) is author if they fight ideas on the gender and tell us what works they intend to fight against .
Or do they attack them just like the kind described in Le Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te or Val@@ ers ?
Their sources are Ju@@ di@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I love you well , and you are an intelligent and cul@@ tured someone .
I said that on Ju@@ dic@@ ith in the F@@ ur@@ us@@ to ve@@ in ev@@ o@@ king Hol@@ oph@@ er@@ ine , rapprochement that was not coming to me ( I don &apos;t have his vi@@ vac@@ ity of mind ) .
Otherwise , in the &quot; bottom &quot; , since you refer to it , this subject doesn &apos;t interest me , and sincerely I don &apos;t see where the problem is : I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my arre@@ ars , because I &apos;@@ m slow but I understand ...
@ Jean : Do you recognize that , cul@@ turally , I refer Ju@@ di@@ ith to Hol@@ oph@@ é@@ ine , it does it .
Who is sc@@ ared about asking Mon@@ de ?
But what are we afraid of those who are sc@@ ared ?

We are obviously no longer in the idea debate .
That &apos;s something else , much deeper .
@ Have you read , Jean , that Le Mon@@ de published an article about the need for the@@ ology ?
@ : As far as an idea debate is concerned , I thought that we needed to go to the sources .
To pretend to fight ideas from the only ex@@ pos@@ é that their de@@ tr@@ actors ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ atz@@ inger , inven@@ tor of the The@@ ory of Gen@@ re or X L@@ ac@@ ro@@ i@@ x , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ an ) does not seem very rigorous .
But I &apos;@@ m good , as I explained to our friend , U@@ p@@ ph@@ ist &apos;s friend , it &apos;s all the difference between having an enligh@@ tened opinion and a simple opinion .
I &apos;@@ m not on the other hand that it &apos;s understood the nu@@ ance .
I di@@ dn &apos;t read Ju@@ dic@@ ith , the very symbolic g@@ or@@ ge of g@@ or@@ ge , I satisfied myself with the &quot; second sex &quot; ( it was more of my time ) that I think is the source of &quot; the source &quot; according to L@@ o &apos;s wishes .
While I watched the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se since M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , I saw red lights when the mo@@ on was briefly shown when the cl@@ ou@@ ds were opened .

It was cra@@ zy here at F@@ N@@ Q .

I was in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne then naturally I saw only cl@@ ou@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne has also managed to cover himself during the entire week of the rain of the Per@@ se@@ i@@ des Per@@ se@@ il@@ es and for almost all the astr@@ on@@ om@@ ical major phenomena of recent years .
I &apos;@@ m starting to think that there is a bad gen@@ i@@ us whose sole goal is to prevent people of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything from the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an Observ@@ atory , even if things improve greatly on the other side of the Cor@@ d@@ il@@ ère .
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se because of the cl@@ ou@@ ds above the sub@@ ur@@ bs of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .

But these are the examples to follow .
The reform of no@@ tar@@ ies would create a demand for compensation in the order of EUR 8 billion .
The Ministry of the Econom@@ y tells us that these claims for compensation are unfounded .
What about in the event of a mistake by the Ministry of the Econom@@ y ?
Having gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the no@@ tar@@ ies , will they have the same courage when submitting the bill to the state budget ?
The continuation in his time .
O@@ k , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ..@@ .@@ .
@ lo@@ l No the state is not comparable to households as far as management of its budget is concerned because the time frame of the state is theore@@ tically infin@@ ite while that of the house@@ wife is limited to the lifetime of its members .
Also , unless public spending is considered un@@ productive , they contribute to funding material and im@@ material investments that are the same for tomorrow &apos;s growth and therefore for future reci@@ pes .
A few answers .
It &apos;s a regrettable decision .
But remember the sac@@ red Hi@@ p@@ po@@ tent o@@ ath : the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be maintained above all .
Jo@@ lie theory of the con@@ spir@@ acy .
Unfortunately , the truth does not correspond to your fant@@ asy .
Med@@ ical staff would like to use it , but they have the hands linked by law as written by politicians .
It &apos;s the same situation as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions rather than having risky sur@@ ger@@ y interventions , safe ho@@ ot rooms for drug addic@@ ts rather than having them in the streets , etc .
On these issues politicians want to please the accused m@@ asses .
Ac@@ tually , doctors don &apos;t earn money with medic@@ ation .
That &apos;s why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors don &apos;t earn money from medic@@ ations given that the Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States , you should find out how it works .
Do@@ c@@ tors everywhere are cour@@ ted in the same way , but it &apos;s more or less visible .
It was perhaps wrong to put the blame on the b@@ bi@@ bi@@ kes , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to company profits and to &quot; research &quot; .
Re@@ ad the few rare reports on our expenses of P@@ harm@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ ef@@ its Sch@@ em@@ e and on the negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ing the world &apos;s prices for medicines everywhere , as well as the differences between countries on what is on sale freely or only on prescri@@ ption .
It &apos;s stronger it &apos;s a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific process , direct or indirect .
In fact some companies are currently carrying out tests on mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ ation against on@@ co@@ logical pain , despite laws that hold them back and the expensive permits necessary .
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that we use alternatives like mari@@ ju@@ ana , those who reach a version offering good quality products to known do@@ ses will largely benefit .
S@@ or@@ ry to tell you this , but you &apos;@@ re wrong , there &apos;s a lot of things going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharm@@ acies .
As for this hospital , they were happy to use it until someone put the chi@@ p on the ear of a hospital officer .

If &quot; researchers &quot; in social sciences were to research instead of politics and net@@ working , we could be using their &quot; work &quot; .
A resear@@ cher investigation , he doesn &apos;t compare something to another .
Com@@ par@@ ing it is not looking for .
Com@@ par@@ ing is to do the teaching not of research .
We can &apos;t say &quot; research is successful you have to apply it &quot; and then in the same j@@ et &quot; You have to experiment with everything &quot; .
If your research is successful why experi@@ mentation ?
If your research is not successful why ask you to apply them ?
Can we explain to myself how a &quot; resear@@ cher &quot; can de@@ duce that a pup@@ il who cannot equ@@ ate mathema@@ tics alone could make mathema@@ tics and other materials easier ?
New technologies allow to learn from the condition that students learn to use new technologies but how will they learn the new technologies if they don &apos;t know how to learn ?

A single aven@@ ue to train teachers : to remove the S@@ oph@@ ists and ideolo@@ gues and for practi@@ tioners to teach practi@@ tioners .
Take read the paragraph on intern@@ ships ( which unfortunately is@@ n &apos;t very argued ) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conser@@ va@@ tism : &quot; It &apos;s a de@@ vice that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices , and that doesn &apos;t allow the system to progress &quot; .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system we can &apos;t want only practi@@ tioners to teach the practi@@ tioners , even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training .
Education the@@ or@@ ists must have no place .
Pr@@ acti@@ tioners must have one .
Would you want to be operated by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and who never put foot in a company operating before ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system .
Gi@@ ving education the@@ or@@ ists more weight would be destroy it definitively .
Your analo@@ gy is completely cra@@ zy : if I would not like to be operated by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has only a theoretical training , I would still like less to get operated by a sur@@ ge@@ on who has no theoretical training and who learned on the job .

If one day I feel guilty to violate copyright , I will have to read an article like this one .
In an information economy , the violation of copyright = the@@ ft .
It &apos;s the same thing because they have to quote their sources correctly .
often , getting a licen@@ se does not cost anything .
No , it &apos;s a violation of copyright .
Not the same thing .
By using the content without having the right licen@@ se , you take away the artists from their bre@@ ad .
You can always debate educational hypo@@ thes@@ es - but it &apos;s the@@ ft .
And you can repeat it as much as you like , it will not become true .
It &apos;s a violation of copyright .
C@@ ome on , repeat it again .
If one day I feel guilty to violate copyright

If they think they should receive money for images used in school , a almost perfect definition of what a reasonable use should be , so I &apos;@@ m happy to deprive them of this shadow income .
The lesson no 1 should be to show how , if children themselves create anything and publish it on their fav@@ or@@ ite social networks , they give up all intellectual property at the site under the general conditions they passed from a c@@ lic@@ k .

What sho@@ ots France down is the speeches like yours .
@ gu@@ s I have always worked in private companies .
I had C@@ HA@@ N@@ CE for having worked in companies run by excellent companies : it exists in France but it &apos;s rare .
I &apos;@@ m a salary because I know I don &apos;t have the skills to lead a company and this choice allows me to sho@@ ot at the na@@ ked bos@@ ses that I meet frequently .
At ease in my bas@@ ke@@ t@@ tes I totally share Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an &apos;s post : he says the horri@@ ble truth !
@ gu@@ s , if we compare with German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly mention to ask for reforms in France , in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive , especially by as@@ suring the link between large companies and medium and small ones - what are the French bos@@ ses waiting for to do the same ? ?
Let the state hold their hands ?
This state that they accuse of imperialism ?
@ Jacques L@@ .
Still this anti-@@ business couple on your part !
Rem@@ ember , what did you create as employment , as an added value , to be so severe ?
@ P@@ ate I understand your reaction .
In reality , France faces an in@@ solu@@ ble problem : the in@@ competence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who move and work while waiting for the permanent state assist@@ ant !
It &apos;s terrible !
But they have solutions : suppression of the Lab@@ or Code , employers &apos; charges , taxes , work 4@@ 5@@ h / week paid 35 , and some , wal@@ king on eggs , dare to call for salaries to be reduced otherwise their removal !
I look forward to seeing all the &quot; negative &quot; comments on this subject .
This is ironic given the way people always complain about the F@@ ir@@ st Group .
From what I see from where I &apos;@@ m , L@@ as@@ t has not really been an investment for us taxpayers .
They tried to stay af@@ lo@@ at rather than transform .
It doesn &apos;t mean that the Scottish railway has not improved since L@@ ast takes care .
But they also improved with their predecessors , including British R@@ ail .
Unfortunately , we don &apos;t have the power to do that , unfortunately .
I tried to have them recently , but I di@@ dn &apos;t succeed .
But good , Lab@@ or will anno@@ y us , is@@ n &apos;t it ...
It &apos;s an international subsidiary .
They already operate trains in Germany .
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral company and taking part in inv@@ itations to tender .
But it seems that we are not very good in management , most of our priva@@ tized services end up being managed by a foreign operator .
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when F@@ ir@@ st won the Vir@@ g@@ in contract , all for the decision finally to be cancelled .
And there &apos;s better : M@@ T@@ R , a Hong Kong company won the operating contract of Cro@@ s@@ rail for 8 years .
Well , Labour , as they told us during the referendum campaign , is totally for po@@ oling and sharing and thinks that workers must all help each other across borders .
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision ; )
Maybe it &apos;s because the management of the Dutch is on the right track while the British are not .
What S@@ co@@ t@@ ail needs is not just a change of owner but especially new ideas .

As@@ sum@@ ing that being &quot; beaten &quot; is higher than many others , the concern of others , the intelligence , the listen , for example , the fact of being &quot; be@@ ating &quot; has nothing to do with the one to survive a disease : &quot; beaten canc@@ ers , which are no less dead , I know of pa@@ lan@@ es .
St@@ or@@ ting a disease has nothing to do with merit .
C@@ ome on again as well .
I &apos;@@ m not telling you that it &apos;s L@@ A condition to manage , I tell you that A@@ F@@ DI .@@ .
Nothing to see with any merit ... !
When the examples of your life , there are only you to judge them .
I &apos;@@ ll start again .
In@@ sing , if only for a moment , that we can have merit to get out of a disease or that we can deserve not out of it , is simply mon@@ str@@ ous .
The body follows or does not follow .
A body that rela@@ ys , from everywhere , despite the will , despite the confidence in medicine , have a vague idea of what C ?
N@@ av@@ é to think otherwise , if , having a solid mor@@ ale allows it to be easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it , to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not to refuse them for fear .@@ .
Some@@ one who is fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who tru@@ sts in medicine .@@ .
But if we prefer to rely on &quot; l@@ ord &quot; it &apos;s something else .@@ .
Neither with the deserve or with the courage .
These considerations are clean for mor@@ alists .
When you catch a sal@@ t , a real , you get out to the point of becoming only a z@@ om@@ bi@@ e .
Personally , I caught two , b@@ alls , big ones , and if I &apos;@@ ve &quot; beaten &quot; as these psycho@@ log@@ ists say , it completely escap@@ ed me .
Unless this fight is only to sha@@ ke te@@ eth , to suffer hell and to bur@@ n down .
I thought the accusation against him was decided and fin@@ alized about 10 years ago .
I di@@ dn &apos;t see this name in the newspapers since at least this time .
What is happening ?
It &apos;s an anniversary .
A forgotten birth@@ day .
His trial was conducted &quot; quickly &quot; and then swept under the car@@ pet .
Is it the story we told at the time ?
The communist communist who triggered three wars in the Balkans during the last decade ?
The communist president of the Socialist F@@ eder@@ ative Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please , ask what we deliberately leave aside : 1 .
How could NATO bombing be legal under international law M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ R@@ R rule under international law ?
Which country did Serbia attack ?
On the R@@ TS ( Rad@@ i@@ o-@@ Tele@@ visi@@ on-@@ Ser@@ bi@@ a ) , why do you not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians , then considered it a valid target .
Milosevic had no way out : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , it would be cru@@ ci@@ fied like a tra@@ itor .
And if he defended him , he would be sw@@ ay@@ ed by the western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
W@@ ester@@ ners used a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en to de@@ t@@ ach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed independence and was almost recognised by the western states who then li@@ ed to the end of the situation on the ground .
The Ser@@ b population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , is dead politically after his first term for not knowing how to understand the situation that had developed .
Z@@ or@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time .
At the end of the day , Gu@@ ard@@ an should not call Milosevic ty@@ rant ( even if we don &apos;t like it ) .
To my knowledge , only in Greece is a method of predic@@ ting earthquakes that works almost , by weigh@@ ing up the pedestri@@ an level in the quar@@ tz .
This kind of studies is definitely useful and thank you for making us share the results .
H@@ ope , therefore , but caution has nothing to do with that of the ex@@ op@@ lan@@ te named HA@@ T@@ -@@ P@@ 1@@ 1@@ b , located at about 1@@ 24 light years from the Earth in the con@@ st@@ ellation C@@ y@@ gn@@ us that would be &quot; the smallest and the cold planet to present detec@@ table water m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules &quot; , according to a study carried out by the D@@ rak@@ e D@@ em@@ ing and J@@ on@@ a@@ than F@@ ra@@ ine team of the University of Mar@@ y@@ land .@@ .
So M@@ eth@@ o@@ de to follow .
Like those that involve animals sen@@ sing a threat .
Thanks to science as a scienti@@ st to give us , often , these experimental pro@@ w@@ ess that are carried out in the world .
How would animals save ( advance ) ?
Without doubt , the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the event of a se@@ ism .
Like the ra@@ don for example .
A pri@@ ori in@@ od@@ ore gas for the man but maybe the animals can be found .
All these methods are in@@ separ@@ able for man , but not for the measure of measu@@ rement at his disposal .
But we don &apos;t have reliable results on these paths ...
It has been observed many times ( and for centuries ) that certain animals act in a strange way a few hours with an earthquake , especially the h@@ ens , cows , dogs , but especially fish and s@@ na@@ kes .
I saw a report on the map telling the fight of two scientific teams , a Califor@@ n@@ ian , the other Japanese , to make the validity of their work known about the sensitivity of animals to ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al mag@@ netic fields , and especially their change before a se@@ ism .
Well then , I &apos;@@ m not a scienti@@ st but their hypo@@ thes@@ es had convinced me !
Or are we looking at this research ?
Why dis@@ d@@ ain this path ?
We should learn to listen to nature ...
If we look at things cal@@ m@@ ly and strictly , we publish it in a serious review , and nobody mis@@ ses it .
As soon as we talk about the &quot; signs &quot; of animals , we &apos;@@ re coming up against the same bias : everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish was we@@ ir@@ d in circles .
I don &apos;t understand that we can think that Bor@@ is would be a good leader for the Conservatives .
He did too much as may@@ or of London .
When you listen to the L@@ BC program , we can &apos;t help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he always tries to di@@ g into a jo@@ ke with a jo@@ ke .
It never responds directly to anything .
He also said he agreed with Far@@ age , then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari the presen@@ ter asked him what .
He could not name a single point .
He made so many promises to get elected as may@@ or and he di@@ dn &apos;t hold a single one .
It only serves to point out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is a bun@@ ch of sh@@ it , no ?
Because he &apos;s popular .
Because it &apos;s fun@@ ny .
He was in &quot; H@@ ve I Go@@ t Ne@@ ws . Y@@ ou &quot; .
Because it &apos;s a celebr@@ ity and people have accused people of the love of cele@@ bri@@ ties .
The Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him and the same will be true of the rest of the country .
When ( and not if ) he takes the party &apos;s leadership , the popularity ratings of the T@@ ories will give up the ceiling I am sure .
May God help us .
I &apos;@@ m not so sure : people like jo@@ kes , but don &apos;t want their first minister to be one of them .
That &apos;s exactly what we said about Lon@@ don@@ ers .
He should have brought with him his friend the par@@ p@@ ain@@ g , smar@@ ter than him .
In many ways , I think he &apos;s trying to copy R B@@ ran@@ son .
The Americans have had one of them .
The French really and always dis@@ interested from the history of the Pacific war .
For all those who took the trouble to read some books ( he exists , including a French and excellent of B@@ .
Mil@@ lot ) , the &quot; Sol@@ om@@ on &quot; and the &quot; sh@@ it stra@@ it &quot; speak , unfortunately as well as the deaths who stay@@ ed there .
We understand that the Australia , who knows ( one of their heavy cr@@ us@@ ers , the Australia , must always be there by the bottom since the battle of Sav@@ o ) doesn &apos;t want to go back .
We actually went to the i@@ le de Sav@@ o , in the &quot; Ir@@ on B@@ ot@@ to@@ m Sou@@ d &quot; .
Even if the mission is coming to an end .
It &apos;s good the small .
But the co@@ t@@ é co@@ ol@@ o is a total smo@@ ker .
Cal@@ cul@@ ate the k@@ er@@ o@@ z@@ en@@ e to reach the objective credibility totally dis@@ credits the concept .@@ .
You only need to go through the list of spons@@ ors only of phil@@ an@@ thro@@ p@@ ists .
A co@@ m operation neither does nor has done .

Your c@@ lic@@ h@@ é makes me take over a bit in passing ( I also learned to s@@ ail with the Cro@@ co@@ s of L El@@ or@@ n at the M@@ ou@@ in B@@ lan@@ c R@@ ace in B@@ est ! ) .

Good evening I think that the red bo@@ y who demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brit@@ t@@ any region and the V@@ ille de Br@@ rest .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not spend a pen@@ ny on our taxes to finance the dreams of a few even as nice ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rers - there !
Are there players in the current Ser@@ b training that is of a Kosov@@ ar origin ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ joy in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , once at Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now in F@@ en@@ er@@ b@@ h@@ ç@@ e , are Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I don &apos;t know if they are still in the team .
It &apos;s Bis@@ ev@@ a@@ c &apos;s defen@@ der of L@@ y@@ on , not B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic was middle ground or before in the 7@@ 0s and 8@@ 0s and resulted in many teams in Greece , but I don &apos;t know where he is .
B@@ a@@ jo@@ vic is from Mo@@ star , in Bosnia-Herzegovina , and played as an attack on the great team of Vel@@ z who , under the tu@@ t@@ el@@ age of the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary S@@ ul@@ em@@ an Re@@ ba@@ c , ended twice in the second place in the Yugoslav League ( and also counted points like V@@ a@@ hi@@ d H@@ al@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ zi@@ ic and loyal Ar@@ s@@ è@@ ne W@@ eng@@ er , Bor@@ o Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c ) .
Well , thank you Mo@@ le !
Of course I know H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ zi@@ ic and Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c .
Just out of cu@@ ri@@ osity , what happened to K@@ ra@@ si@@ c ?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was at the Ju@@ ve , he is currently in Turkey , but the last time he appeared on my ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en he was linked to Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n * ch@@ illing *
Here , I can &apos;t help you .
I know he lost his place when Con@@ te arrived , then he went to the Fun@@ er and as much as I know he &apos;s not a holder .
Maybe he can still do something , maybe in the Indian Sup@@ er League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Ser@@ iously , Albania is not sc@@ ared .
You should love Albania because you are neighbors .
The thing is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of the real Albania today .
Ap@@ parently it was the flag of Greater Albania , which encomp@@ asses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
A bit of excessive nationalism , actually .
Luc@@ k@@ ily , there was not too much damage ( I know ) .
In fact , it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what we call the Greater Albania , but of the country before 19@@ 13 , when the major European powers decided to give their country &apos;s jobs to neighbouring countries .
How can you feel &quot; an explosion of joy &quot; by seeing two tow@@ ers collap@@ sing knowing that women , men and hom@@ eless children are inside ?
How ?
What bo@@ thers me a little in this &quot; testi@@ mony &quot; is that the fact of having been able , if only once , spontane@@ ously to rejo@@ ice at the horri@@ ble death of thousands of people , testi@@ fies for me a personality &quot; B@@ line line &quot; whose &quot; testi@@ monies &quot; should be taken with the greatest circum@@ stance . S@@ hit .
Without doubt , in the short time of &quot; joy &quot; , we won &apos;t think about the dead or the reality of the horror me@@ ted out .
We just thought , for a moment , that for once Muslims had managed to do really and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tically bad for the big S@@ at@@ an in its very heart .
To be powerful .
Very gr@@ an@@ di@@ ose .
It seems that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims who were surrounded by their feeling of humiliation .
With fil@@ med testi@@ monies in Palestine .
S@@ cha@@ den@@ fre@@ ude S@@ cha@@ den@@ de .
We had a bit of doubt about it .
The &quot; Christian / white / g@@ au@@ laws &quot; West cannot measure the degree of rub@@ b@@ ish , anger , hate of the mu@@ su@@ man . When he con@@ forms to misery , the social and cultural under@@ development of the Muslim Arab world of <unk> d@@ today .
I &apos;@@ m talking about the sub@@ ur@@ bs of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not the tow@@ ers of Du@@ b@@ i .
The past , certainly mag@@ ni@@ fied , is not a cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How to get the Muslim world out of this di@@ abol@@ ical ent@@ oura@@ ge ?
T@@ ot@@ ally in phase , 2 major pois@@ ons anno@@ y the Arab world : bi@@ go@@ te conser@@ va@@ tism of the powers in place and fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common point , the freeze of thought and communication ( f@@ res@@ h@@ ly or armed ) of his critical expression .
That we have understood it before , must not put Muslims back .
That &apos;s the only way .
Did Ed@@ w@@ y P@@ len@@ el read this article ?
I suppose it &apos;s true in many countries .
But in Britain , the fall marks the beginning of six long dark , we@@ t@@ lands , we@@ ir@@ d and de@@ pressing ones that affect the well-being and mood of many people .
Moreover , everyone falls ill .
Pro@@ ble@@ ms seas@@ on@@ ality .

The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain , with or without rain .
The particular campaign is worth brea@@ thing in the autumn .
Not as much to cut the b@@ reath as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being on the point of dying .
In Britain , if you &apos;@@ re lucky , the summer falls a weekend .
We had a nice summer this year , don &apos;t do your gr@@ in@@ ch@@ y that equi@@ ps c@@ lic@@ h@@ és !
Not everyone .
I rarely come sick in winter .
But now I &apos;@@ m reti@@ red and I don &apos;t develop more immunity for the ger@@ ms of the outside , it can change , I suppose .
It &apos;s not to be on the point of dying , it &apos;s just a stage in a cycle ...
A mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous step full of en@@ ig@@ matic sm@@ ell@@ s , with a fe@@ br@@ ility that cultiv@@ ates with f@@ es@@ tivities like H@@ all@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , the risks of en@@ s@@ oring and full of other wonderful words .

Those are my recommendations for the f@@ es@@ tivities for you .

For the tax burden for children , it &apos;s the amount made by the state that comes mainly from decisions 8 to 10 .
But when it comes to the number of households having their taxes rising due to this measure , it &apos;s especially the 4 and 5 decisions that are affected ( medi@@ ans income ) according to grap@@ h 2 .
The half-@@ part suppression , especially in relation to wid@@ ows , is not dealt with at all in the article or rather its impact is completely under evaluation : 2@@ 30 M of euros is a jo@@ ke that doesn &apos;t take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies it is in@@ dol@@ ere .
And it &apos;s not ready to help .
Well , we &apos;@@ re not on the stra@@ w of course , but s@@ ong .
For once the PS makes a rather left politics we &apos;@@ ll not cry ...
It is obvious that those who are part of the 20 % of the richest have to bear much more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let us continue in this way and you will encourage these 20 % to work less or to leave .
Well , I know , it &apos;s not politically correct , but I &apos;@@ m saying it anyway .
L@@ ong live the Tro@@ ts and the O@@ C@@ I recyc@@ led to the PS : they understood everything .
Adam , you can &apos;t see what you look at .
The proportion is still the same , here or in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population own@@ s 80 % of the wealth .
A fair tax is when he prohibits anyone from am@@ assing as much as he can .
Beyond a certain limit the money loses all its usefulness .
And once the value of money is exceeded , money only serves money , it &apos;s ) to say to make the greatest number of people mis@@ fortune .
We are part of the 20 % richest .
There are probably also 20 % of households that work the most ( and create wealth , part of which is logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must allow these households to enjoy part of their efforts .
Or else we should lower our arms and live in social minim@@ ums , especially if we have social housing .

No problem .
In one of the two , we had things that we would not have had in a 5 st@@ ars ho@@ tel and we did not have to present to the reception or face the slightest trace .

A@@ h , 6 too late .
I love Air@@ b@@ n@@ b .
&quot; It &apos;s very dangerous and highly risky &quot; No that is not true .
You just really missed luck .
According to the link provided in the article :
In its discharge , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &apos;s response to T@@ em@@ an was quick , almost absur@@ dly fast .
In 24 hours , according to an e-@@ mail provided to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b had sent a r@@ ur@@ ri@@ er to change the s@@ na@@ res , took provisions to spend a week at the ho@@ tel and transferred $ 23 8@@ 17 ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b is assured , but Even so ) .
So why does this article quote T@@ em@@ an complaining that he received no support from Air@@ b@@ n@@ b ?
I &apos;@@ D@@ OR@@ E A@@ IR@@ B@@ N@@ B , to receive like to travel .
H@@ ell@@ o I &apos;@@ m looking for people who have already used b@@ n@@ b just to reassure me .

I am sure it will please families and close to the thousands of Kurdish people who died at hal@@ ab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends died to anything other than the chemical bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment of S@@ ad@@ in S@@ ous@@ in .
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author , your comment is in@@ a@@ property ( to stay pol@@ ite ) .
Also , how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
It &apos;s not clear the author &apos;s style : &quot; looking for weapons of mass destruction .
We agree .
You think that is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education .
This is never the time to strengthen education because we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ native : It &apos;s TO@@ U@@ J@@ O@@ UR@@ S the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war ?
We would already strengthen education if we &quot; &quot; them &quot; were to work 35 hours hours instead of 17 .
At the moment our teachers are earning more than engineers .
And let us not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program .
But this doesn &apos;t see itself since National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college / high school with its prof@@ essors so they work at home .
A kind of forced tele@@ working , in short , unless the employer pays neither the computer , nor the internet connection or supplies .
By the way , it &apos;s so much the plan@@ k at 5 : a week and 4 months of vac@@ ation that we can &apos;t fill the CA@@ P@@ S de m@@ ath@@ s , come and wait for you .
How do you not want to co@@ ok you badly educated about whose parents cra@@ p you on top of it ?
I think that the priority in this area is to dis@@ arm ji@@ ha@@ dis@@ ts so that the k@@ hur@@ de population can develop better .
Where we see that the Bush administration has absolutely everything wrong .
My first qualified job was in the sale , in London , to earn three times nothing and it was still a position for which you needed a diplom@@ a .
One year later , I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London me@@ tr@@ o , it was paid £ 5 000 more per year and we did not even ask for the patent .
I never regret it .
On this subject , don &apos;t worry if you don &apos;t find a gradu@@ ate job , don &apos;t try to find something either who pays good , or you like to do it .
If I had stay@@ ed to qualified jobs , I would still have to pay my student loan .
I don &apos;t like work in business so much , so I hope to end up in the civil service or in the university world .
L@@ O@@ L L@@ OL L@@ OL L@@ OL is that article really late !
Ex@@ ac@@ tly , when I got my diplom@@ a in 2011 , there was already a three-@@ year-old back@@ lo@@ g .
The best way to reduce the number of gradu@@ ates without jobs ?
To get rid of the b@@ is@@ ou@@ gu@@ r sectors like art / letters / theat@@ re / media / political philosophy / science is to say what we call unemployed degrees .
I have one of these degrees and I ended up director of production .
It turned out that the important thing was not the diplom@@ a but , as the article says , a good professional journey , starting in school and throughout the university .
Of course , the starting salary was lower but we quickly clim@@ bed the lad@@ der because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge .
This debate on engineers / artistic sectors has been going on for years .
Scienti@@ sts cannot solve all the problems , it is more important to be able to get up the morning , get to work on time and inter@@ act with people so as to get results .
Le@@ t@@ ters , philosophy and art are b@@ is@@ ou@@ <unk> sectors ?
It &apos;s ridiculous .
I suppose you talk about educational degrees study of the media or whatever the ab@@ con@@ se sector where you went .
L@@ et@@ ters , philosophy , political science and art are real sectors .
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school , which understand the importance of culture bases like literature , art , etc . , and put them in value .
Would it not be better to have a real territorial policy to un@@ load Paris and to dynam@@ ise the rest of France ?
Personally , I find it hard to see the inhabitants of the fin@@ gers of Es@@ s@@ on@@ ne and the V@@ al-@@ d of O@@ ise to do 8@@ 0@@ km aller@@ km every day to come to work in Paris .
In@@ tra@@ -@@ mon@@ gers and small bel@@ ts already have many common public means of transportation ( me@@ tr@@ o , bus , tra@@ m ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Several secure and closed par@@ ks , as already exists in the cities of northern Europe , in Di@@ j@@ on or L@@ y@@ on , will be inst@@ alled on the ve@@ e .
Good idea .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by 2@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , we hope that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark .
That benefits from their big experience in the field .
Well , we did not find room for U@@ N S@@ U@@ L de@@ vice for a bi@@ ke bi@@ ke .
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ and Del@@ ann@@ e ...
Well , it &apos;s not right at all .
When we discuss with pedestri@@ ans and other public transport users why they don &apos;t ped@@ al it , it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are : 1 / c is hy@@ per dangerous with all these agno@@ s@@ les , these tr@@ uc@@ ks , these sco@@ o@@ ters who work sup@@ er fast and get out of it . the survival of bi@@ kes 2 / we get full of pollution in my head for me the bic@@ ycle paths are going to go , we need to reduce car traffic ( urban toll type type charge ) , reduce speed ( Paris = zone 30 ) , make the traffic code respect systematically ( even the v@@ ou@@ chers B@@ y@@ mo@@ l says that you need to adapt the code of the road written for a 100 years ago to bi@@ kes ) , gener@@ alize bu@@ ff@@ er zones after the cl@@ ou@@ ded pass@@ ages , not before they &apos;@@ re not even b@@ ast@@ ard and sco@@ o@@ ters .
The cycle paths are apar@@ theid , you have to live together but re@@ balance the occupation of urban space .
Nothing on the bi@@ ke in the great Paris ?
Not a word about the place of bi@@ ke in public transport ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .
The goal of 15 % / v@@ el@@ o de@@ plac@@ ements is ridiculous .

My children are not a financial asset .
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the EC@@ HR , but I di@@ dn &apos;t hear that a complaint was actually lod@@ ged .
Also , they should file a complaint first in Germany or in Ukraine .
I also expect these cases to be rejected pending the result of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that would follow .
Y@@ e@@ ah , but Libya did not blow up P@@ an A@@ m , either .
Mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a Air@@ lines is not wrong , the fault lies with the air space security authority , in this case the Ukrainian government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had been killed before , Ukraine launched air attacks on the rebels and every plane could of course be seen as a possible and immediate threat .
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or did he choose to play with the lives of innocent people so that the airlines would pay for over@@ flight rights ?
Where are all the pro-@@ Ki@@ ye@@ v tro@@ l@@ ls that defend their us@@ u@@ red government / ultra-@@ nation@@ alists in Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in general that Putin sho@@ ots the flight M@@ H@@ 17 .
As far as I know , there is already a complaint against the government of Ki@@ v because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky .
The previous one : a 198@@ 6 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Con@@ tra@@ s in Nicaragua does not mean that the United States is responsible for their actions .
No chance Russia leaves this affair to the IC@@ J .
It &apos;s fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t means Putin that some Australia were killed by rebels supported by Russia .
I hope he can present evidence to support his claims .
So far , the investig@@ ators have not said anything like this .

One single B@@ é@@ o@@ tian question : the poor of today is poorer than the poor of yesterday ?
I can &apos;t get tired of pointing out that those who critici@@ ze the most vir@@ ul@@ ty of Pi@@ ke@@ tty &apos;s book did not read it !
It &apos;s easy to read , I took a few days .
It shows the statistical evolution of res@@ res@@ -@@ production , res@@ res@@ sion , unequal concentration , inequality of labor income , the property of capital , deserves and deserves in the term .@@ .
It shows that today &apos;s concentration of today &apos;s capital join@@ s in the beginning of the 20 ° before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it &apos;s the 2 world wars that low@@ ered the concentration of capital , from 19@@ 14 to 19@@ 45 , then how concentration takes up after ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : you &apos;@@ re not d@@ ining what .
I ask you how long it took you to read this pa@@ v@@ é knowing that an individual &apos;s concentration capacity has a few limits .
Then , the question is not whether it &apos;s easy to read .
The question is if the summary of the central thesis that the press has given is right or wrong .
If she is right , we can debate it without having read the book , the most important of which is to argue one-@@ way in favor of it .
No , it &apos;s easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : how long did you put to read it ?
Is the central thesis of his pa@@ ved sum@@ med up by the press is false ?
I di@@ dn &apos;t read and will not read it .
So I &apos;@@ m relying on the summary of his central thesis and it &apos;s this one that seems pure fu@@ n .
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .

But remember she only 17 years old .
An age that most people are just starting to find their place in the world .
I hope this price will not be a burden for the young gir@@ l and she will find her way to lead a happy life .
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the Western governments who want to prove the old ad@@ age that the per@@ ver@@ ts are the embo@@ di@@ ment of evil .
All my best wishes in Mal@@ ala , but she must realize that she is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neigh@@ bor@@ hoods in Great Britain !
Some@@ body thought his speech was a bit strange .
She than@@ ked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that , if she was not where she is now , she would have been married at 14 .
Does Mal@@ ala itself not form part of these &quot; col@@ or@@ ful col@@ our@@ ful &quot; ?
You should have no &quot; an@@ ten@@ na time &quot; on this site .
You are , yourself , a horri@@ ble per@@ nic@@ ious .
It &apos;s absolutely revol@@ ting .
No , his father was not going to mar@@ ry her at 14 years .
She was 15 years old when you shot her .
His father leads a school where girls are school and he &apos;s in favor of equal rights for women .
He is , and has always been , so that she gets a higher education and that she has the right to decide for herself on her marriage .
But it &apos;s someone unusual in Pakistan , because he thinks that women are equal to men .
What she said is that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 , without having her word .
S@@ or@@ ry that she di@@ dn &apos;t write it eloqu@@ ently for you .
It may seem contradictory , but maybe she says that if her father di@@ dn &apos;t give him freedom , she would have been married at 14 years .
Rather disappointed by this season 4 entry and especially by J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange , which obviously finds it hard to find his S@@ so@@ y character from Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ tr@@ ich .
I just looked at the two modern seas@@ ons that are quite different but I have to admit that it &apos;s one of the best horror series , one of the most successful ones !
A first fascin@@ ating episo@@ de .
A@@ re@@ as are close to perfect and the J@@ es@@ si@@ ca S@@ ho@@ w S@@ ho@@ w sing the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on Mar@@ s from Bo@@ ie is simply over@@ turning .
I have not yet watched this new season ( which will be the last for me , without L@@ ange bo@@ f ) .
In the case of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r St@@ ory , I preferred to have just to watch 13 episo@@ des spread out of 3 to 4 months .
But one thing is on , outside of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lar@@ ge Ex@@ tra@@ ordinary , it &apos;s mostly the risk of scenes and mountains that sid@@ ing me .
We have in A@@ H@@ S an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans that makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of the san@@ i@@ tisation of today &apos;s produc@@ tions .
It escap@@ es me a little from you throwing it in advance for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting to be able to measure quality .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange is certainly a P@@ ill@@ ar of this series but , you say it so well , there are many other things .
No , it &apos;s simply that for me J@@ es@@ si@@ ca L@@ ange ( and especially his path and the way she uses it ) is really U@@ N of the series of the series outside the technical skills .
And well , well , I look a lot for her .
Then I think that the series pil@@ es by writing , she wants to do too much at the same time .
The 3 was slightly below , in the 2 , it was too sc@@ attered despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I don &apos;t see them doing 10 seas@@ ons of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r St@@ or@@ y or it will end like 24 hours chron@@ ically .
But good everyone does what wants to do !
It &apos;s by what I say &quot; I &apos;@@ m not going to watch later &quot; that everyone is forced to do the same !
I just share my point of view nothing more , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , J@@ E thinks it will be fatal .
But then , that &apos;s just my opinion .
Let &apos;s talk less about tax increases , please - c@@ let rather the state spending .
No , let &apos;s increase spending please .
Those who wanted to sab@@ otage the expenses failed .
Dis@@ sen@@ ting po@@ le@@ m@@ ics about relatively low spending , like development assistance
The problem is that it represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call for and during all this time some , in each camp , pretend that these nu@@ ances are much more important and substantive than they are - and the voters see their game and find them of it . bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of expenses .
The &quot; debt &quot; is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country .
The &quot; debt &quot; is nothing that should worry .
I would see no problem in the government approaching a third of my income ( before even talking about taxes on consumption ) if I thought he was going to make good use of it .
But it &apos;s not the case , and a lot of taxpayers have the same feeling .
It is said that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age was not completely honest about how to reduce taxes but good , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development assistance , Hi@@ gh S@@ pain@@ ed 2 , subsidies for wind@@ wind wind@@ mil@@ ls . You should arrive at a figure that makes the Lab@@ or tax and Li@@ b@@ -@@ De@@ m tax quite ridiculous on the most lu@@ x@@ ous homes .
Your first 10 000 £ are not tax@@ able .
This means that someone who ear@@ ns £ 35 000 per year will pay around £ 5 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone with £ 50 000 would pay around £ 10 000 ( a fifth ) , etc . and someone with £ 200 000 pays about £ 70 000 ( just over a third ) .
And social contributions ?
The more social contributions , the more local taxes , the more the car par@@ king fees and the car stic@@ ker , and it &apos;s before the VAT .
Almost exactly 30 % of my money is taken from the source before the local taxes and the car stic@@ ker .
I &apos;@@ m paid in a decent way , but not in an extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant way .
Not that it &apos;s a problem , of course , I &apos;@@ m happy to pay my taxes .
But let &apos;s not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky , or that it &apos;s not important to know where billions of p@@ ounds of taxes go .
How can a unemployed person looking for work prove it ?
Even so , 20 % of the unemployed would not seek , it means that 80 % are looking for and don &apos;t find it .
Since I even unemployed , I &apos;@@ m more interested than others are looking for or not ?
Whether a potential recru@@ it@@ er gets 10 or 20 C@@ V , it bo@@ thers my chances .
Indeed , I di@@ dn &apos;t have any news from Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i for months , it means that the agents are more busy control operations than really getting announ@@ cements of employment back ?
I don &apos;t see the interest .
Because it &apos;s not for the state to provide work .
If Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i does not provide enough positions , then we have to do without Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i .
What is a sensitive subject ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case we can assure that the unemployed are fulfilling their duties well in return for their rights .
Just as a contro@@ ller asks for their transportation title to users of a transport medium , a service bos@@ s or are employees of their work , etc .
Nobody sh@@ outs at scandal in these cases , no ?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights : the only two times when I had to deal with Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i , my rights at the ARE had been poorly established , and on one of the files , am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated by 40 % , it had to be fought firm .
It takes time !
I &apos;@@ m not an expert in law .
The file and control are taking hold at the moment , while stat@@ ure Po@@ le Emp@@ lo@@ i is close to being , actually , an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees , they are the ones who pay the con@@ ti@@ tis@@ ations .
Polic@@ ies and French non-@@ employees give themselves rights that they don &apos;t actually have !
It &apos;s not normal .
I would add that worthy unemployment insurance particip@@ ates in the enhan@@ cement of sal@@ ari@@ ed work .
More than waiting for kill@@ er tw@@ e@@ ets in Arab@@ ic ...
In reality , we need to have a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop I@@ sis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would then look at the spread of black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with the war and the movement of people at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is have had the spirit of banning this year the H@@ ad@@ j to M@@ ec@@ ca to Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms coming from the three affected countries .
El@@ P@@ is reports that 7 400 have seen their application for a visa refused because of their country of origin or their recent tri@@ ps .
In fact , there was the case of a pil@@ gri@@ m coming from Bos@@ n@@ ian who contr@@ acted the vari@@ o@@ le to M@@ ec@@ ca during the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m@@ age coming from Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence .
Is it my heart to propose to prevent the sick of E@@ bol@@ a from taking a plane for Europe ?
I thought it was simple sense but apparently those &quot; who know &quot; decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people ...
These West African countries where E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be strict quar@@ ant@@ ine .
Nobody comes out .
Only health workers can enter .
21 days of waiting after dealing with patients before they can go .
If they contract the E@@ bol@@ a virus while they are there , they stay there until they are cu@@ red .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Only last week , people were infected after having had contacts with people in West Africa . Even though they took &quot; all the necessary caution &quot; .
We can stop the progress of this disease .
It spre@@ ads mainly by the air companies .
Let us stop offering them to ste@@ al to these countries .
Moreover , customs agents at airports should be trained to spot people with typical symptoms of É@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be put in quar@@ ant@@ ine immediately .
That he can get the message from the first individual and from the group ( including religious ) second and he won the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt that he is able to erec@@ t as a dogma the image of God characterized by the total cor@@ tex of the planet in operation .
He &apos;s still a long way from this idea .
Only 20 years ago the information appeared like the given bon@@ us of humanity , while religion , which came out of the brain , runs our actions since Lul@@ ny maybe .
What is the point of becoming an ump@@ teenth Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who di@@ dn &apos;t notice it , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely minority in France today , no one is forced to join .
Those who critici@@ ze do not put foot in the Church anyway , there &apos;s only to see the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France .
What is the next step , we remove the notion of sin , too &quot; anxiety &quot; ?
@ le@@ ise : S@@ or@@ ry the church does not have a limited vision to France .
And in the world , it will be possible to reach more people ...
@ Mar@@ tine E , to be honest ( as usual ) respect for others as you plan it pre-@@ in the ch@@ ris@@ t .
H@@ ill@@ el a century before him already said : &quot; don &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t want to do , it &apos;s there the entire Tor@@ ah and the rest is only comment : go and study ! &quot;
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces the ag@@ ap@@ se .
Your &quot; to advance justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity &quot; but without God ?
It &apos;s a return to communism ? : )
Next step : we take away the inc@@ ar@@ nation and resur@@ rec@@ tion .
Je@@ sus will remain this her@@ o who has shocked moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity .
Not very Catholic ?
I think I remember that the low number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France is mainly explained by the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and for@@ ci@@ bly converted a few centuries ago .
I hesitate to buy that , the new A@@ link game , or W@@ ast@@ eland 2 .
And the new E@@ li@@ te game soon comes .
It doesn &apos;t work .
Personally , I would choose S@@ M .
I like W@@ ast@@ and 2 ( I even participated in his fund campaign ) but I don &apos;t think it &apos;s 30 £ .
If it &apos;s the P@@ C version you are interested in , Green M@@ an G@@ ing currently sel@@ ls S@@ M to 30 £ and also proposes a good 20 % reduction .
Green M@@ an G@@ ing currently sel@@ ls S@@ M to 30 £ and also offers a good 20 % reduction .
I &apos;@@ m going to look .
Of course not at work .
The ra@@ be@@ joy of the computer department is blocking all sites nice .
H@@ ell@@ o , is it 30 £ £ 30 and 20 % reduction , or does the 30 include the 20 % reduction ?
Be@@ ware , however : the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
It took me by surprise , I bought it , but can &apos;t play it .
Also , I bought it on Ste@@ am , so no reimbursement is zero .
It &apos;s time to buy a new video card * .
It &apos;s a Brazilian site , but you get a valid Ste@@ am identi@@ fi@@ er , I think .
Ca@@ ve@@ at emp@@ tor and all this : I di@@ dn &apos;t use it myself .
Ama@@ z@@ on 30 £ for P@@ C , 35 for X@@ bo@@ x 3@@ 60 and P@@ S@@ 3 , 44 £ for X@@ bo@@ x and P@@ S@@ 4
Thank you , I &apos;@@ m afraid that one day they will remove it from your libr@@ ary if they decide to cr@@ ack down against people who buy it where they are outside of the planned region .
So please join the be@@ ta version of Ed@@ ite : D@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
So , was France in 19@@ 40 a &quot; sh@@ it@@ ty breeding ground &quot; ?

You need to love it with 40 , the France of &quot; the strange defeat &quot; ?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature we wonder if P@@ rou@@ st or Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky would have it today .
Nobel is not even an event , we don &apos;t even want to read pri@@ zed authors .
Brazili@@ ans , Chinese or Australia will read Mo@@ di@@ ano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes such a limited uni@@ verse and so ha@@ ck@@ ne@@ yed ?
I hope that the other No@@ els are more credible but frankly I doubt it .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , Mus@@ s@@ o have only a distant relationship with literature .
Have you read at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
It would be better to judge .
As for the Chinese , the Brazili@@ ans and others , don &apos;t worry for them .
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture , they .
They &apos;@@ ll be able to appreciate that .
Mo@@ di@@ ano in his fair value , if they already know him !
For your part , keep going to L@@ é@@ vy and Mus@@ s@@ o .
I share your opinion .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me Mus@@ s@@ o keep all their chances .
So see who got the Nobel Prize for literature : H@@ .
P@@ in@@ ter in 2005 , D@@ .

It &apos;s Wednesday !
I had a few days of rest .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val of beer and the ci@@ der of N@@ ot@@ t@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was bo@@ g@@ us .
I managed to disgu@@ ise 19 different be@@ ers , W@@ ob@@ b@@ y We@@ a@@ sel being one of my fav@@ or@@ ite .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mix of people there , there was not only fan@@ atic fana@@ tics ( not to be confused with the fana@@ tics of the cam@@ era ) .
Con@@ tro@@ lling back on Sunday was really hard .
Monday night we went to the grand@@ father of a friend to play n@@ ud@@ g bra@@ g .
Thanks to a real beginning , I could go back with several decent up@@ dates .
I hope that if I arrive at 95 years I &apos;@@ m going to be as lively as him .
Last night I went to a co@@ ck@@ ta@@ ils bar chic@@ ken in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my be@@ ver@@ ages arrived with a slic@@ e of l@@ ard on it .
I ad@@ mire Mr
Re@@ ad a little Bou@@ d@@ d@@ ha and you will understand how wrong you are , Christian .
Having said that , without wanting to anno@@ y you , I think you &apos;@@ re moving away a little from the subject .
This famous entire , it bans qu@@ e@@ ues for ji@@ ha@@ sty people out of the mo@@ squ@@ es .
It mentions arms trafficking without delay .
Either we have the great eyes open like Med@@ de@@ b and Taiwan or Bou@@ ba@@ ker or we have the big closed eyes .
You have to choose .
It &apos;s not by keeping the closed eyes that you get light .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , dear Christian , but once again , you make a monu@@ mental counter-@@ sense : all the authorities , organisations or associations representative , Muslim or not , having formally condemned the IS and its crimes , the French , Muslim or not , have nothing to add to these formal official convictions .
Who does not say word word .
The problem is that people like you see them first like Muslims , Arabs or African people .
Not like French .
Unfortunately , dear Ko@@ ch , Mer@@ v@@ el , the doubt exists for everyone .
As I said a thousand times , some people doubt the acceptance by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be stupid and fool@@ ish to accuse them pri@@ ori and to demand that they protest publicly to prove to French society that it &apos;s wrong to doubt it .
In my opinion , this principle is denial of the re@@ public and can only help to de@@ t@@ ach French society .
I don &apos;t have any doubt about it , so to speak .
Who does not say word for word , but what do you agree ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations to I@@ I or the conviction of I@@ I .
The silence is very practical , it &apos;s the main weapon of those who want to spare the go@@ at and the k@@ iss .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but realistic .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , during the elections , &quot; reven@@ ge &quot; parties represented in West@@ min@@ ster because a huge gap has increased between their proposals for dev@@ olution and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence .
Cameron must be pe@@ tri@@ fied to the idea of losing all these seats in West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must take care to lau@@ gh .
What are these threats ?
Conservatives are completely unaware of Scotland because they have no basis there .
They can do what they want with all electoral impunity .
I don &apos;t think that Cameron even is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in West@@ min@@ ster for the benefit of the S@@ N@@ P is good in the long run for him and the Conservatives .
Who will pay a te@@ ar for the Lab@@ or Party .
They &apos;@@ re going to get rid of themselves in Scotland by the S@@ N@@ P and U@@ K@@ IP who will cut their head in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ band join@@ s the &quot; PR@@ M@@ ES@@ ES@@ ES@@ ES@@ SE &quot; thinking that he saved his party but without knowing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish de@@ pu@@ ties .
No wonder that some Labour members ask their leader to account .
If the S@@ N@@ P w@@ ins 20-@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives , then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Lab@@ or to do what they promised for it . Ma@@ x@@ imum dev@@ olution .
I think it &apos;s more important .
Not if Lab@@ or or Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected one day in England .
C@@ alling 8 % p@@ um@@ ps at the expense of 85 % , it &apos;s not a sup@@ er electoral strategy .
Also , once Scottish de@@ pu@@ ties no longer be able to vote on the issues concerning England , the Conservatives will win all the votes .
O@@ h , I think it &apos;s true .
Cameron may not have much to lose , but M@@ ili@@ band if .
Mag@@ gi@@ e did it with U@@ l@@ ster Uni@@ onists and it succeeded him well .
But he is still in li@@ king to be prime minister in 2015 and that since he won the Lab@@ or Party leadership .
So , basically , these bo@@ xes will be virtually behind every read@@ er to look over his shoulder and see what he reads , how he reads , and until the end .
It &apos;s &quot; The life of others &quot; from East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B applied to the world of F@@ R@@ I@@ C ...
Al@@ ways the same fasc@@ ination for surveillance techniques .
Ultimately , it will at least have a ster@@ ili@@ zed effect .
I &apos;@@ m waiting for the next ticket : Ama@@ z@@ on manufacturing V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E book according to V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E profile and that automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of its secret !

F@@ rankly , stimul@@ ation .
Thank you for the article .
As under this system , the management of the D@@ R@@ M@@ s has not been imp@@ acted , it &apos;s left to me to read the pir@@ ated files , public domain books or bought with a few ed@@ itors who have the intelligence to propose files without f@@ uc@@ king .

In your release public , you systematically notice that everyone gives his fi@@ de@@ lity card ( f@@ n * c , * * i@@ re , ... ) .
There are also demanding ma@@ ster@@ pieces whose opening and completion rates are probably lau@@ g@@ hable .
For example , &quot; Fin@@ ne@@ g@@ ans W@@ e &quot; of James Jo@@ ce .
@ Thomas : In the Bi@@ g D@@ at@@ a era , the data doesn &apos;t really need to be personal to be relevant .
Be@@ ware of not putting all the literature in the same ba@@ g .

The harvest is not an@@ onymous .
K@@ ob@@ o data is published by K@@ ob@@ o , which allows neither the read@@ ers nor the authors to identify .
But K@@ ob@@ o has all this information well , he &apos;s .
There have been so many exaggerated , er@@ ron@@ eous and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government in the last few days that the country seems to be governed by a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten class full of sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic girls .
It &apos;s even worse if you take into account Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism .
It &apos;s interesting that some supporters of Er@@ dog@@ an think that Islamist is such an insult that they are removing your comment , but not mine . ; - )
Well then : -@@ P But Turkey doesn &apos;t want to sho@@ ot itself in the foot unless it gets something .
If she attack I@@ SIS , I@@ SIS will lau@@ gh , so it &apos;s actually sho@@ oting yourself in the foot .
A reti@@ red diplom@@ at written on his blo@@ g : &quot; The A@@ P reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to over@@ throw Syria &apos;s President Bas@@ ha@@ r Al@@ -@@ Assad because it would jeopardise Israel &apos;s security .
It &apos;s not clear in the article if Iran was sending a serious warning warning or just advis@@ ing caution .
This second option is more likely and , in any case , what really sur@@ prises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria , Israel and the security of the region . &quot;
Indi@@ an P@@ un@@ ch@@ line &apos;s reading is to recommend strongly to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the * neuro@@ ner@@ ies swept away by the traditional media . The short article you give is important and should be read with the realistic comments / warnings from Iran coming from Iran to propose Afghanistan around . from 1979 - 1980 .
Who are these &quot; moder@@ ates &quot; who seriously fight against the horri@@ ble secular Assad and at the same time the per@@ ver@@ ts of I@@ SIS ?
The policy of the pipelines push@@ es the world toward the ab@@ me and I would suggest to those who refer to non-@@ existing &quot; moder@@ ates &quot; to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending children from others to fight in the Third World War .
&quot; It &apos;s even worse if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Er@@ dog@@ an . &quot; Are there any other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?
I have one in mind .
We need a N@@ u@@ rem@@ berg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turkish people .
&quot; should &quot; be &quot; needed &quot; ?
You realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being still alive ?
A little late for that , my friend ...
Are criminals not barely old now , like 120 years ?
A bit late for that , no ?
Especially concerning the C@@ U@@ P tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate that planned and directed the genocide , Tal@@ a@@ at and D@@ j@@ em@@ a@@ al killed just after the 1@@ st World War by reven@@ ge by the Armen@@ ians , and En@@ ver killed by Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks in a p@@ acked place of the Central Asia almost at the same time , when he went there and dre@@ am@@ ed of bas@@ ing a Turkish empire there .

The Palestinians don &apos;t have a partner for peace .
Unfortunately , Netanyahu never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace .
@ J@@ on@@ a@@ than : Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy settlements ( moreover , it was also the case of R@@ ab@@ in ) .
It is obvious that R@@ ab@@ in , Netanyahu and their voters all preferred to have peace in peace .
He takes his clo@@ thes , post them on the ro@@ ck and enter the water .
An Israeli stolen them .
The Israeli representative is angry and ste@@ aling : &quot; What are you talking about ?
The Israeli people were not even there at the time ! &quot; .
The Palestinian representative ( UN ) s@@ mile and added : and now things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bi@@ polar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower the guard ...
That it &apos;s dis@@ agre@@ eable to the anti-@@ Israeli people is obvious , it &apos;s not the desired goal ...

In the Israeli / colonial conflict , for the creation of the Palestinian state , it &apos;s certain , it will continue !
For the creation of Israel , you don &apos;t answer .

You doubt it ? ! ! !
Also , all this not only revol@@ ves around Rus@@ sell B@@ and , but the journalists of the Gu@@ ard@@ an seem to have trouble going beyond anything that he doesn &apos;t have to say .
Many of what he says are only p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ sts not others .
This proves that you don &apos;t understand what Rus@@ sell B@@ and says , or what No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky says .
It &apos;s just a sequ@@ el of personal attacks and ins@@ in@@ uation ( my 13@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l likes her , which means it &apos;s a question of imm@@ un@@ ity ) .
A really vicious charge , with just a suspicion of raising awareness that Rus@@ sell B@@ and says some tru@@ ths , maybe tru@@ ths that we prefer not to think about .
C@@ ome on , this feeling will become more and more widespread !
I can understand why B@@ lan@@ and horri@@ ble some : he sometimes speaks pre@@ ten@@ tious and after all the absur@@ dities of t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids . He does indeed give the impression of being a beg@@ g@@ ar-@@ th@@ y-@@ neighb@@ or , but this whole story of not voting has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my opinion .
The general consensus seems to be that he just says to people not to vote and rather to cross the arm and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview with Pa@@ x@@ man and other articles / video articles he posted , he said that voting once every 5 years for the L@@ subscri@@ ption or Conservatives ( or Li@@ b D@@ em@@ es I suppose ) and limit democratic engagement to this is completely useless , both parties ( to slightly different degrees ) governed mainly in favor of special interests , multinational companies and the rich , at no point does he say to completely ignore the politics because these parties don &apos;t rule in our name : he insists that rather than just voting and dis@@ connec@@ ting himself for five years , people should become much more active politically at local level , organize movements , demonstrations , petitions , regardless of what and try to influence politics from that .
I don &apos;t say that I necessarily agree with his solution ( because I think that being politically active by submitting his requests can go hand in hand with voting , given that politicians are gi@@ f@@ tes that will change their mind if they really risk losing elections ) , but it &apos;s missed to see all these answers con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding people say that this im@@ bec@@ ile that makes Je@@ sus tell young people not to take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it &apos;s really distort his arguments .
His solution is extremely deb@@ at@@ able and it would be good if people were to debate what he really says rather than just label it as ir@@ responsibly and put aside the concerns of him and a lot of people left for account .
Yes , thank you .
The thing about the vote was completely mis@@ represented .
I &apos;@@ m deeply anno@@ yed about the fact that my vote really does not count for nothing .
I want more referendums , the electronic vote , direct democracy and de@@ pu@@ ties who give a local account to their voters .
Also , I dispute the idea that the words of Rus@@ sell B@@ and are not side ( written by others ) .
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas , even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-@@ farming thin@@ kers and aca@@ demics from the counter-@@ culture that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne would want to bring together under the label &quot; bil@@ es@@ e@@ e p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ists &quot; .
I &apos;@@ m rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne .
Maybe that &apos;s what the Gu@@ ard@@ an could do , that S@@ z@@ an@@ ne does like Pol@@ ly To@@ y@@ n@@ be@@ e and interview Rus@@ sell on a v@@ ér@@ anda , with even the head@@ ac@@ he ho@@ o@@ ks added to the mon@@ t@@ age !
Like Ma@@ x K@@ e@@ is@@ er , who initially attacked Rus@@ sel but ended up becoming one of his f@@ ans and invite him in his show , it &apos;s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come .
It runs into a political dis@@ course that has existed for generations , but which has been margin@@ alized by traditional media - including the Gu@@ ard@@ an - for generations .
This &quot; fron@@ t@@ loading &quot; reveals , above all , to me that the intellectual debate has long been held in the R@@ D@@ V@@ s in the history where professional histor@@ ians have become a minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become poorer for the benefit of l@@ on@@ ely con@@ den@@ sed type of press issues .
For my part , I saw in Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ e@@ u &apos;s intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need to blame someone , a scapego@@ at .
They develop some very rational reasoning , but this ration@@ ality is based on these scapego@@ ats who are the ke@@ y@@ stone of their thinking .
I think rather that for F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , the state was necessary as a cul@@ pri@@ t .
This is a very ar@@ cha@@ ic thought , the thought sacrific@@ ing , which is also magic thinking .
We solve the problem from the relationship to the other by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ ist sl@@ ope , neo-@@ li@@ b and / or / or liber@@ tarian ( both terms marks a hard@@ ening of the government &apos;s desire to stamp out its markets , the first knowing how to seek the rescue of the state for its markets ) in the sense of the least state / not of the state at any state at F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ol@@ o . You &apos;@@ re talking about it .
The old dream of the self-@@ organize base .
His thought is built on the cul@@ p@@ ability of the state : without this cul@@ p@@ ability it doesn &apos;t hold up .
Who says guilty , says elimination , murder , sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here .
Nor , moreover , support .
The totalitarian left remember the good old time , that of its go@@ d at the time , Stalin , the little father of the people .
O@@ ul@@ ala , you probably read a ch@@ ou@@ ya too fast if you took F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult &apos;s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apo@@ logy of K@@ home@@ ini .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ gers would no longer be am@@ using to attack Michel by this way ...
G@@ au@@ de poses a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective , on the difficulty that the accession mechanism represents in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether we agree or not with him , he &apos;s an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
Se@@ eing this cab@@ al or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by human scientists in the hard-@@ left human sciences who don &apos;t bear the br@@ unt of al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ as is pretty lau@@ g@@ hable .
The nar@@ c@@ is@@ is@@ is@@ is@@ me and the author@@ itarianism of these people is without limits .
An important point to add seems to be the position of these &quot; rebels , &quot; which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of the Chinese and other &quot; y@@ el@@ low &quot; that I saw in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You did not have the pleasure of hearing our Australia friends on this subject , then .
And where was it in Russia that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I don &apos;t remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time .
In London and they were nice in my opinion when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time , in a market .
Chinese think similar to white !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and from Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou a long time ago , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them holding viol@@ ently anti-@@ -B@@ lan@@ cs .
My father is@@ n &apos;t happy that his el@@ der gir@@ l was born like a B@@ lan@@ c .
I also think that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years : they are becoming richer and richer , prosperity spre@@ ads outside the big cities , and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live .
From what I was told , Russians mostly have prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications from the Cauc@@ uses and Central Asia , who work in professions and in zones where they have a lot of luck to be exploited by their employers or face crime and high violence .
Although I lived on the banks of the river I@@ en@@ is@@ se@@ i in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
Unfortunately , I heard the opinions of the Australia about the Chinese and the A@@ ori@@ gen@@ s .
It &apos;s really strange that a foreign@@ er tells me that I don &apos;t support the Chinese , while I met two in my life ( including one abroad ) , they di@@ dn &apos;t keep bad memories , all people are worth it and actually , those of London were very nice that &apos;s the only one . That &apos;s why I remembered that they were Chinese .
Otherwise we don &apos;t remember who we meet , all people are equal , how to remember who was who was .
Do you know what is we@@ ir@@ d ?
That you and the other Russian are talking about Chinese as a kind of unique fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attr@@ action in a zo@@ o .
And yet you &apos;@@ re always coming out with the so-called B@@ lan@@ c .
How many Chinese men are with white people , by comparison ?
None , because there &apos;s a lot of chances that parents in these lan@@ es would attack them PH@@ Y@@ S@@ E@@ ME@@ N@@ T .
No measure of the fairness of justice .
However , it &apos;s the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipul@@ ated by highly marked groups on the left like the union of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy ...
@ Mar@@ ou@@ t : sorry , but judicial circles are frankly brand right .
When the judiciary of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy , it only re@@ pres@@ ses 25 % of judges .
If a measure of its bias can be made based on the rela@@ tivity of the application of laws in the courts , it order to remove two obstacles .
The one of the political vision of the observer like that of the judicial interpretation of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ate .
It then remains the mandatory tool of the law to re@@ focus the evaluation on the basi@@ cs .
The measure of its in@@ observe in all judicial acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , included , force to make a distinction between the error and the bias of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates .
It would be fu@@ n to claim that acts of justice do not spread between these three groups .
The claim and lack of knowledge does not come from an objective analysis .
And if all this is not analysed , how can I say that justice improves in France ?
If only by statistics revealing implic@@ itly that she starts from a very low level .
The previous pre@@ fec@@ t makes it possible to register what follows in the third ratio .
The one of corruption * of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy .
sensitive project in proportion to the power of nu@@ is@@ ance * that is given to the judicial institution capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The domain considered is that of the rob@@ ber@@ y * of he@@ irs committed until through procedure fraud * by gener@@ al@@ og@@ ists man@@ dated by no@@ tar@@ ies .
This profession gets a good year bad € 150 million while benefiting from the * coverage by the qu@@ asi@@ -@@ judicial impunity * French no@@ de .
For understanding their mechanism , one part was reported in the comments following the first published .
Where it join@@ s the so-called statistical improvement * moderate by the previous comment , it is that the judicial institution has produced , during many differences between gener@@ al@@ og@@ ist and he@@ irs to get rid of themselves , a whole series of legal cases contrary to all laws fav@@ orable to he@@ irs .
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria not a cra@@ zy form of lying ?
Surely prices are totally prohibi@@ tive .

I think the inven@@ tor of W@@ h@@ ill has never had to clean a dog cr@@ ack on a sh@@ it .
I &apos;@@ m sure my s@@ ister would love the tri@@ cycle every ground , but it &apos;s simply too expensive .
The whe@@ el@@ chair of ul@@ tr@@ a long distance would be perfect for a disabled person with a pen@@ ch@@ ant for the long-@@ distance .
Here , there are h@@ ills who would like them .
P@@ ric@@ es seem to be high , but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bi@@ ke , so &quot; you see &quot; .
The tri@@ fec@@ ta every field seems particularly useful to me .
All disabled people are not poor , however .
Many of them have insurance of a reasonable amount .
Only if they have become disabled .
The thing is that the whe@@ el@@ chair market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know they need .
We can &apos;t really say that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
It &apos;s an example of excessive design .

primary and populist action
In fact we don &apos;t know too much what Mar@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see that ?
Because Germans refused to help the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I &apos;@@ m not sure that Spe@@ e really had &quot; refused &quot; to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ si@@ e in his book &quot; C@@ ast@@ les of Ste@@ el &quot; suggests that Spe@@ e quickly left the zone because he received a report showing British co@@ o@@ king in the zone .
The sea was heated at the beginning of the day ; I don &apos;t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle ?
Similarly , the fight ended after sin@@ king the sun , making every rescue operation more difficult .
Comp@@ are this with the following battle , that of the Mal@@ ou@@ ins , where , on the photo@@ s showing the survi@@ v@@ ors who are being res@@ cu@@ ed , we see a calm sea and in the day .
Moreover , the res@@ cu@@ ers knew that there were no German fighters at this stage in the zone at this stage .
H@@ m@@ m , that doesn &apos;t really correspond to what I remember having read about this battle , so I made a quick research on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia :
&quot; There was some confusion among German ships about the fate of the two co@@ o@@ king cr@@ us@@ ers , who had disappeared in the dark after stopping the sho@@ ot , and a rac@@ e-@@ prosecution started .
The L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g lives something in fire , but getting closer he lives that it was only a wrec@@ k .
The N@@ ü@@ r@@ berg , slower than other German ships , join@@ s the battle late and lives on Mon@@ m@@ ith , pen@@ ned and seriously damaged but still on the move .
Having pointed out its spot@@ light on the ship &apos;s flag , the proposal to go was refused and it opened fire , finally b@@ lowing the ship .
Without reliable information , you &apos;@@ re judging that the Go@@ o@@ d H@@ ope had to escape and stop the research at 10 : 15 .
D@@ on &apos;t worry about the reports showing a British co@@ o@@ king in the surrounding area , he hur@@ ts the north . &quot;
So , if it &apos;s true , Germans , in the dark before the invention of ra@@ d@@ ar , did not know that a ship had sun@@ k , and so could not look for survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also thought that there was a larger co@@ o@@ king of the Ro@@ yal N@@ av@@ y in the area that could have seriously damaged them , so in confusion they disgu@@ ise to enjoy their advance .
They were far from their base and Spe@@ e was aware that they should find a way through many vessels from the Ro@@ yal N@@ av@@ y .
C@@ ra@@ do@@ k &apos;s sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their am@@ muni@@ tion , thus condemning them when they were finally taken .
Several voices are in the U@@ M@@ P asking for it to be written in the law that an elected elected person is therefore definitively in@@ eligible .
This is a courageous position , which would also affect elected lef@@ ti@@ sts well on .

When will the ban on unions in sectors already protected ?

Vie@@ w@@ ed by politicians ( es ) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , which are still quick to emb@@ ed those same ones who will benefit from their in@@ am@@ ity to ham@@ mer the actions of the real policies , who really try to get things moving , not the nice words .

She supports the existence of politici@@ zed unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of her party .
She would not defend the same thes@@ es if right-wing unions , even extreme right , were targeted for person@@ alities on her board and led against a judicial and media war .
Your statements are completely free .
If , at the moment , the right is def@@ ying the current judiciary , it &apos;s simply that it has committed facts that come under it !
We have no example of left-wing personality who had so much to do with justice but all those who were the subject of his attention did not have any fav@@ orable treatment .
On the other hand , it must also be remembered that the union of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ acy that is on the left is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and that it is minority .
That a minister supports with so much commitment the unions shows how useful they can be .
@ M@@ R@@ C The union you mention is perhaps a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but its influence is great on the Chan@@ cell@@ ery , it &apos;s not a secret .

It looks like M@@ ary White came back from the dead .
Since your test offer is almost over , may I suggest you go to Ca@@ thol@@ ics Times .
I &apos;@@ m sure you will feel more at home .
He pref@@ ers mi@@ ke@@ do@@ w .
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists , courageous , so that they can write about the Middle East , E@@ bol@@ a , etc . At their risk and per@@ ils .
Rather than just la@@ ugh@@ ing with these pu@@ er@@ ile d@@ ass jo@@ kes .
Not very bad .
G@@ o ahead then .
If these &quot; chil@@ dish jo@@ kes &quot; are so shocking , you don &apos;t have to participate , is@@ n &apos;t you ?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and E@@ bol@@ a and that it is perfectly possible to do both and publish an article on the an@@ al sex ?
Is it the subject that shocked you , or the fact that people are in a la@@ ugh@@ ing stock ?
Nevertheless , we find the am@@ ate@@ ur video of the crash on the net ...
video am@@ ate@@ ur of the crash on the net ... ? ?
If the F@@ O@@ M chose not to show these images , it &apos;s only to protect its interests in no way those of the pilot .
If the F@@ O@@ M had wanted to protect the pil@@ ots , it would have come out of the ba@@ g because at the moment a different vehicle ( for example , breakdown ) came onto the cir@@ cu@@ it .
But we had to finish quickly before the typ@@ ho@@ on that we knew he arrived , but for which the F@@ O@@ M di@@ dn &apos;t consider it appropriate to advance the departure time ( TV law , pu@@ b , money ... ) .
But apart from that they protect the pil@@ ots well .
Well , yes , I also share this opinion .
But there is also the fact that if the very tight F@@ O@@ M comes into the S@@ C , it will allow Nic@@ o Ros@@ berg to have a chance to beat the English that led then ...
You go on this blo@@ g my dear Dayton .
But it &apos;s not serious , I have a bit of time to get all your c * * * * * .
No , just no .
There have been lots of con@@ spir@@ acies in F@@ 1 , but never one that puts Commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of a pilot &apos;s victory at the expense of another .
It &apos;s not the F@@ O@@ M that comes out of the ba@@ g because it &apos;s IF@@ A .
S@@ size of size .
In view of the am@@ ate@@ ur images , the lack of image makes it especially possible for F@@ I@@ A to avoid troub@@ les@@ ome questions of the type : How is it that the Commissioner ag@@ it@@ ates a green flag in the middle of the accident and continues to do it after the accident ( see the video complete after the accident )
No , it &apos;s not because the video is deemed too violent for F@@ IA to block images of the accident but because one of the Commissioners is clearly a green flag , sign that the race can normally resume normally and that we &apos;@@ re more under y@@ el@@ low flag regime .
Some comments show a dark ignorance of F@@ 1 .
Yes , dear E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne , the race is no longer under the y@@ el@@ low flag of flag A@@ P@@ ES place the place of accident , hence the green flag .
It &apos;s the usual procedure .
The post of comm@@ is@@ ers just down@@ stream of the accident ( depending on the case , it can be 10 me@@ ters like 10 0@@ me@@ ters after the accident ) ag@@ it@@ ate the green to tell the pil@@ ots to resume normal lit .
Sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism is selling the pu@@ b .
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government &apos;s &quot; patri@@ otic &quot; propaganda offensive , but I &apos;@@ m afraid that , at the end of the day , it &apos;s just money .
And sex , let &apos;s not forget sex , the fear of not having sexual life , the pu@@ b and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ations do exactly the same thing .
Ma@@ ke bu@@ z@@ z with inf@@ o that we really don &apos;t need to care about is just to continue to sc@@ are people so that they can continue to control them .
&quot; When the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ ids touch about E@@ bol@@ a , we all attractive the fear &quot; It should be &quot; der@@ ail@@ ed &quot; not &quot; touch &quot; .
Given the medical reference , &quot; breaking &quot; is much better said in this context than &quot; der@@ ail@@ ing &quot; .
I wonder if all the people who panic that E@@ bol@@ a could start to spread by air realize that they now believe in the evolution ?
You make them too hon@@ orable .
They probably think that is the end of the world and that E@@ bol@@ a is just one of the signs of apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se that approaches .
E@@ bol@@ a is An@@ te@@ ch@@ ris@@ t !
You confuse E@@ bol@@ a and Mur@@ do@@ ch ...
Sub@@ per article , thank you !
A short and conc@@ ise article that makes a mo@@ ck@@ ery of and soli@@ dly this des@@ pic@@ able p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ journ@@ alism .
It made me lau@@ gh .
It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media talk about most things with this up@@ turn .
The goal is once again to keep us sc@@ ary and frigh@@ tened enough ( without getting to the hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to get us out of it when it needs it .
I think it &apos;s perfectly logical that , if we have to suffer a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack , why not have a crisis of E@@ bol@@ a in the absence of any proven case ?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises he himself invented .
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear ?
Con@@ gratul@@ ations for this post , and to be of this world almost 35 years later .
At the beginning it had to be horri@@ ble , given the context of the 198@@ 0-@@ 90 .
I &apos;@@ m stupid , live with the certainty to spend years going there for years ...
It &apos;s completely useless .
As always when we talk about science .
Not only testi@@ monies are useless : taken in isolation , they can &apos;t serve as a scientific material .
But they have a harmful influence on the objective appreciation of the facts .
@ traffic : testi@@ monies can &apos;t serve as a scientific material .
It &apos;s perhaps why we abstain from asking patients in psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry when we have reliable comments from the loved ones .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric file mentions that my mother psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t explains that I was educated tele@@ p@@ ically by her mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law .
This is therefore an objective sign .
When I say that it &apos;s a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s a subjec@@ tive testi@@ mony of no importance .
A@@ h , because the att@@ achment of a fact ( = this testi@@ mony , which testi@@ fies to the pollution and efficiency of new treatments ) is useless in a scientific process ?
What are you bas@@ ing the research , then ?
On fan@@ ta@@ si@@ es ?
Do you put in the same level fan@@ ci@@ ful the@@ ories and facts ( = giving rise to veri@@ fiable testi@@ monies ) ?
&quot; Re@@ si@@ li@@ ence &quot; : the word stupid by the grand@@ mothers , f@@ ans of J@@ -@@ L Del@@ ar@@ ue , who take for great psycho@@ log@@ ists after reading D &apos;@@ ur@@ g .
@ J@@ im : There are lots of fu@@ n bu@@ cks in the psycho@@ s .
C@@ yr@@ ul@@ ni@@ k did us the blow of &quot; resili@@ ence &quot; .
Since it &apos;s a great scienti@@ st , C@@ yr@@ ul@@ ni@@ k , I hope he will have bri@@ ef@@ ed us on a reliable scale of measure to quanti@@ fy it , this famous resili@@ ence .
I wonder if the S@@ in@@ n@@ ell@@ es of the air could all save us from Far@@ age and company ? ?
Do you not think about Te@@ am America ?
Ser@@ iously , it &apos;s not * * a good idea to get out of the S@@ enti@@ les from the air ...
And why ?
It was a great series and it looks like those who emerge from it are aware of it !
So let &apos;s leave our sal@@ t to the all-@@ powerful who can do mirac@@ les .
But how are they going to do so for children to han@@ g on ?
The only solution that comes to mind is hum@@ or gender , which would kill the series .
It was already a series for children .
Children were ho@@ o@@ king .
A@@ h , because it &apos;s a series for children ?
The U@@ K@@ IP work for the My@@ ster@@ ons .
So please keep your Te@@ am America .
Al@@ ways in Sup@@ mar@@ isation ?
It will not be the same if we don &apos;t see the s@@ ons and the anim@@ ation is done well . : - )
I look forward to seeing this ( although being an adult ) , but I hope it will give the idea of a channel to re@@ broadcast the old people .
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia ; it has been at least 40 years since we had episo@@ des of an hour on Saturday and Sunday at 0@@ 6 h@@ alls .
Since the arrival of digital television free a few years ago , it is one of the second-@@ class commercial channels and we can always see it at these times .
And also half an hour &apos;s episo@@ des pass at 05 : 30 from Monday to Friday !
F@@ ine , I &apos;@@ m probably a &quot; sad &quot; gu@@ y of 60 , but I don &apos;t look at this series every day !
There &apos;s no &quot; M@@ oun@@ t of the temp@@ le &quot; in or under the mo@@ s@@ que of res@@ ades ! ! !
radical Z@@ ion@@ ists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colon@@ ize Jerusalem .
Moreover , all Israeli sear@@ ches below and around the mo@@ s@@ que of est@@ ates for several decades have not helped to find anything .
The mon@@ t of the temp@@ le if he exists he &apos;s elsewhere .
Can you be in Argentina ? ?
This mon@@ t is not sought for the simple reason that it &apos;s the col@@ um@@ n on which the mo@@ squ@@ es were built .
His summit , or a Ro@@ cher &apos;s host , is seas@@ oned in the middle of the mo@@ s@@ que of Om@@ ar .
For Muslims , Mo@@ ham@@ med was moun@@ ted in parad@@ ise from this ro@@ ck .
For Jews , it &apos;s the mon@@ t M@@ ori@@ ah where A@@ bra@@ ham failed to sacrifice his son I@@ sa@@ a@@ c .
As long as she was caught and cont@@ ex@@ tu@@ alized , there &apos;s no propaganda , but information , dear K@@ 1@@ K@@ 1 .
Israel also counts its extremists , it is good to remind it regularly , and they are unfortunately rela@@ yed in the government ( N@@ af@@ tal@@ i Ben@@ net , A@@ vig@@ d@@ or Li@@ e@@ ber@@ mann , and even Netanyahu , he accepted the plan with 2 states , and he was constantly raising it ! ) .
It is also good to show how much the annex@@ ation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact .
God will he recognize his own ?
The shor@@ test Jewish jo@@ ke : &quot; God is lau@@ ded ! &quot;
To bo@@ ast of tourism in Israel , we often show ourselves naive naive young people , al@@ an@@ gu@@ ies on the be@@ ach .
The reality is , as usual , quite different from what advertising shows , as we can see on the pho@@ to that exemp@@ li@@ fies the article .
It &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary anyway .
And this pho@@ to is a wonderful piece of propaganda !
It &apos;s a shame that the photo@@ grap@@ her of Re@@ u@@ ters did not take photo@@ s of the hundreds of Palestinians authori@@ zed to go back on the M@@ oun@@ t of the temp@@ le and who prefer to go over Jewish follow@@ ers in the counter , pra@@ ying to the Wall .
@ M@@ at , if this pho@@ to bo@@ thers you , it &apos;s right , it &apos;s neither the newspaper nor the photo@@ grap@@ h , but this woman and the ideology she trans@@ mit that we must condemn .
This system is not sustainable and will end up in a la@@ ugh@@ ing stock .
The only way to stop this system is revolution .
Since the economy seems to go into ri@@ ft , big companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They have managed to convince their employees that they have a chance to have a job and that they can &apos;t afford to increase salaries , while at the same time they have given even higher salaries to the small elite at the top .
You are right , it &apos;s not sustainable , but it will only change in that country when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of sho@@ oting and m@@ um@@ ping when someone else makes the strike , support them , show a little solidarity and understand that their strike does not only concern their problems , but also shows your employer that we don &apos;t get people with impunity .
Ex@@ cep@@ t if we abandon democracy , in which case , if , it &apos;s temp@@ able .
I totally agree .
The only thing you for@@ got is that British and American companies sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
Like for example China and India .
All of this can &apos;t end well .
It &apos;s because we &apos;@@ re in a democracy that it held .
Did you vote for the T@@ T@@ IP ?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ IP ) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but it &apos;s exactly what the mechanism for settling differences between investors and states ( IS@@ D@@ S ) proposed by the agreement .
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the un@@ imagin@@ able damage this agreement will have on our lives .
It &apos;s only recently that we are starting to talk about it in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ an Development Movement so look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill did not say &quot; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &quot; ?
These are excellent effects , while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
This gentle@@ man is right , in X@@ V@@ III there were unions in all the regulations .
In the very French Catholic army , there is a sacrific@@ ial dimension .
Le@@ a@@ ve it ( finally , its officers , others , no one knows nothing ) believe themselves the strong co@@ ff@@ in of the e@@ ternal values of France , and it will fight and close .
And then with the decline of the country , globalization , Europe , the crisis of values , in short : dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this little re@@ lic is comfor@@ ting .
Even if for her , it &apos;s becoming increasingly un@@ comfortable ...
They still lack the s@@ emb@@ l@@ ance of married men , c@@ ali@@ br@@ aries , married women , c@@ ali@@ br@@ aries , dogs lost and I don &apos;t know what to do yet .
If you don &apos;t write the French correctly , I union myself .
You &apos;@@ re warned , it will be your fault .
For the defence of vested interests , we already have enough of the protected professions with unions , which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens .
We are asked not to lau@@ gh about the fear of risk by an official .
We can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions , or then without the right to strike like in Germany , in exchange for the protection they enjoy .
Otherwise , a guaranteed disaster .
And with the char@@ ts preparing , the government congratul@@ ates itself .
What security are you talking about ?
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance indeed ...
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance for ignorance Sy@@ bil@@ le I referred to the soldiers and other civil servants , since it &apos;s the subject here commented ...
Sub@@ mit &quot; by the intermedi@@ ary of his delegates &quot; in Article 8 of the 19@@ 46 constitution .
It will become : &quot; 8 .
Every worker particip@@ ates in the collective determination of working conditions and the management of companies . &quot;
This is absolutely necessary with the bur@@ st of informa@@ tive power .
And yet you opened , probably read and commented on a specific article entitled &quot; The Great British B@@ ak@@ e O@@ ff &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ?
Wa@@ it , the section was there , completely empty .
I thought we had to launch the convers@@ ation .
Any@@ way , it &apos;s the marriage of J@@ off@@ rey that I watched , and I can tell you that some have been well ass@@ is@@ ted .
In the J@@ off@@ rey marriage episo@@ de we have one of the best moments ( although misleading : it was wine ) in the history of television .
Also , from the pi@@ e m@@ m@@ m@@ h ...
Lad@@ y of Th@@ ron@@ es !
I love G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
It &apos;s the second time in a row that , stran@@ gely , the show ends with a victory for the least worst b@@ ak@@ er ; no one did like &quot; boom , you &apos;@@ re my ca@@ ke now and get to front your master &quot; !
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally had an effect for them ?
In previous weeks , all these external people were kept apart .
And there is also this idea of &quot; playing security , there &apos;s still next week &quot; who dis@@ appears the last week .
I like co@@ o@@ king but I don &apos;t imagine me@@ ting out that .
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us sup@@ er enter@@ tainment and make us try new things .
C@@ ome on for G@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree , the last challenge of last year , the marriage pi@@ e , was absurd .
Prof@@ es@@ sion@@ als usually make days to do them and they had to co@@ ok one in 3-@@ 4 hours .
The three challenges were really hard to share , I don &apos;t know how they could choose a vic@@ tor .
In Lu@@ is , the only real default they could find was the slightly dry basis ( even though I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that the green ic@@ ing on the Richard m@@ in di@@ dn &apos;t inc@@ ite , anyway , Richard had already lost at that time ) .
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time available .
There is also the cancer that gu@@ ys , with solar b@@ lows .
Un@@ doub@@ tedly , all of us are succe@@ eding at the moment .
A bad time for humanity , we hope .
You &apos;@@ re confusing solar and ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radiation .
U@@ V is blocked mainly by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of solar wind par@@ ticles and U@@ V .
So even if the mag@@ netic field was weakening , there would not be enough solar wind to &quot; hun@@ t &quot; the str@@ at@@ o@@ sphere of the str@@ at@@ o@@ sphere .
There would be even more , and therefore less U@@ V and &quot; cancer &quot; .
Luc@@ k@@ ily , the o@@ z@@ one-@@ layer does not block U@@ V .
They have a lot of useful functions that you don &apos;t suspect .
If we limit ourselves to man , they have the interest of allowing us to have b@@ ones ( syn@@ thesis of Vit@@ am@@ in D ) , to heat us ( less than the In@@ fr@@ ar@@ ou@@ ges ) , to mod@@ ul@@ ate our immune system and , apparently , to improve our mor@@ ale .
The layer of o@@ z@@ one-@@ deple@@ ting the U@@ V@@ C is blocked and the U@@ V@@ A and most of the U@@ V@@ A are blocked .
You know that you don &apos;t have to be con@@ des@@ cen@@ ded and look at your interlocu@@ tor as a stay when you make a comment ?
Especially for a minor prec@@ ision that was under@@ heard in the comment , which himself intends to display ped@@ ago@@ gy .
Without saying that I &apos;@@ m a used of mel@@ an@@ om@@ a , U@@ V only makes AC@@ C@@ L@@ ER its development .
They don &apos;t do it P@@ RO@@ V@@ O@@ V@@ O .
For proof : all people b@@ ron@@ z@@ ated don &apos;t necessarily have mel@@ an@@ om@@ es .
Either , when you tell you that you have to avoid sun and live in the background of a cell@@ ar , it &apos;s better not to listen because U@@ V is necessary for every human person .
The excess , on the other hand , it &apos;s like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
U@@ V directly causes mel@@ an@@ om@@ a .
Can we give it to it ?
And , most important , can we switch it to the mix ?
or switch it to the mix ...
I think that the majority of those interested have established that everything can be pl@@ a@@ ked if we apply it to a sufficient force and the ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 is perfectly acceptable , for the use it is intended to use .
I think that the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e@@ 6 as communications equipment in front line .
But for us ,
It &apos;s still a good choice .
The majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be done if there is a sufficient force .
Ex@@ cep@@ t for a No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
More precisely , is he already b@@ oring ?
We &apos;@@ re doing this jo@@ ke in every discussion .
I decided to count them .
It &apos;s the fourth jo@@ ke about the pl@@ a@@ age I read in the comments today .
It &apos;s hard to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before we inst@@ all specific software , you imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can &apos;t see how it could come back .
So , h@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ o
The most likely is that it &apos;s a production unit on which i@@ O@@ S has not been inst@@ alled properly and which is therefore stuck with the factory code inst@@ alled .
I don &apos;t know at all how they do these things .
But would they put test software on all ?
The photo@@ graph@@ s on E@@ b@@ ay clearly show the lack of F@@ C@@ C or CE lo@@ go and the presence of a red link of proto@@ type .
Well , the article for b@@ ob@@ o par excellence .
We want products that are cheap and we &apos;@@ re surprised that industri@@ alists produce in &quot; industrial companies . You can sup@@ er u sup@@ er u , but all the teaching and the small business are concerned how to complete good , bi@@ o av@@ a@@ c 16@@ 50 € ( average salary in fr@@ ance ) ?
But to answer your post , if it &apos;s possible to eat properly with a little salary .
After all , everyone is free to put his priorities where he sees him .
For my part , food is one .
G@@ o without ran@@ c@@ le , I &apos;@@ m emb@@ ro@@ iling you
We call it b@@ ob@@ os or better b@@ ob@@ lo@@ lo@@ s , people who see the world through an ideological &quot; software &quot; that leads them to dis@@ connect the realities .
It &apos;s the total un@@ bund@@ ling .
They are experts in post@@ uring , for example claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a show@@ er .
They are also experts in tar@@ it@@ ance , joining the lef@@ t-@@ ca@@ ke , which they sometimes come from , for example by condemning CO2 emissions while leaving their holidays to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mix of ideology that is cumbersome and tar@@ n@@ ished as well . Also , do not be surprised to meet with criticism about them often .
Wa@@ h , thank you for this complete and exhaustive the@@ ori@@ zation and for all the associated details ( plane , show@@ er ... ) .
I &apos;@@ d like to be part of it but I don &apos;t find it .
The concept is not that complicated .
The b@@ ob@@ lo@@ lo@@ s are mon@@ ob@@ lo@@ c .
Did you understand the concept of lef@@ t-@@ -@@ c@@ avi@@ ar ?
And you are able to understand the concept of the b@@ ob@@ o@@ ec@@ l@@ o .
It &apos;s the perfect copy with just an ideological nu@@ ance .
The classi@@ fications would be more complicated if we were interested in eco-@@ lo@@ s all short .
B@@ ob@@ o@@ eco@@ l@@ o is part of it but only represents the most visible part of the eco@@ lo@@ s because it &apos;s the one that inf@@ ers the media .
This is a nice gi@@ ra@@ ra@@ h .
Ap@@ parently , no one wants to watch this gi@@ ra@@ ra@@ fe face to face .
She is so badly done that she looks v@@ agu@@ ely like a woman .
H@@ it , you are next to the pl@@ ate .
You need to be part of the micro@@ co@@ s@@ m of art to understand the ama@@ zing beau@@ ty of truth about this work .
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not spent many decades studying and flat@@ tering big artists .
The important thing is not that E@@ mi@@ in doesn &apos;t know how to design and seems always obs@@ essed with the same subject .
The important thing is that she really managed to become angry and famous and famous with no artistic capacity .
It &apos;s * art * .
No , it &apos;s co@@ ch@@ on .
The fact that E@@ um@@ in doesn &apos;t know how to design
This is not really a fact .
It &apos;s rather an opinion .
Ex@@ cep@@ t if the only thing you can appreciate are realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs that smoke while playing a b@@ ill@@ ard .
Jud@@ ging art can be problematic , but not in that case .
De@@ in@@ ding , it &apos;s much more than representing the real .
If you &apos;@@ re only looking for it , a pho@@ to machine will do the business .
The author also talks about the ex@@ pr@@ es@@ ism of E@@ mi@@ in .
Look again and let the image speak for itself , without compar@@ ing it to the kind of design you might prefer .
If it &apos;s so easy , why do you not do it yourself ?
There &apos;s still some savings to be made : equi@@ station activities , the number of hor@@ ses of the republic@@ an custody or the status of general people who are no longer in an active service ..@@ .@@ .
The ( honesty forced to say that France dimin@@ ishes its workforce , but as all the countries have done , sometimes even more drastically , starting with Great Britain .
It &apos;s only half encouraging ...
The operation without the support , it quickly finds its limits !
A sing@@ ular approach , at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses , the in@@ adequacy of our defence tool , especially in the Sa@@ hel .
A bad thing for the local authorities concerned , who lose a dimension of their activities , even part of their history .
Where is the sanc@@ tu@@ ary promised ?
@ ed@@ mon@@ d : that &apos;s what I was saying , look elsewhere where to save but not at home , at home at home , it &apos;s really not possible ...
That &apos;s exactly what you propose to do , look elsewhere where waste is certain .
That all those who have lived with the military thing little or less dare to say here , the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this per@@ im@@ e@@ ter and this without sh@@ it out of sh@@ it ...
Whether we apply the same amount to the entire civil service and public finances will go a little better .
And for Jo@@ i : really rela@@ x : look at public job inflation in the other departments and you will understand why the Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense Defense ( Defense Defense Agency ) can feel a little responsible !
Well yes , the savings on which everyone agrees that they need to be done , must it be seen somewhere , no ?
L@@ ack of po@@ t , those on whom it falls . When it happens at home , the poor Ch@@ er@@ s .
We should do it but above all I don &apos;t get it because , in this case , it &apos;s a crime and not an economy .
Gu@@ v@@ ils , go !
How to close V@@ al de Gra@@ ce will weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As for the local authorities , history repe@@ ats itself at every closure of the post , maternity , hospital , cam@@ era .
But everyone is for the savings of course .
It &apos;s we@@ ir@@ d , a U@@ M@@ P may@@ or who wants compensation and doesn &apos;t look forward to savings made in public spending .
This article is really the most ast@@ ounding thing I have ever read !
This aw@@ k@@ ward moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad jo@@ ke .
It &apos;s the depression to challenge her Fac@@ e@@ book thre@@ ad and see that 80 % of his friends started their stat@@ utes with the phrase &quot; this aw@@ k@@ ward moment &quot; .
I think they &apos;@@ ll make a mo@@ vi@@ e .
He will surely be bas@@ ing himself on hil@@ arious scenes where someone falls by chance on his ex in the bus going to work and only realis@@ es where his sk@@ ir@@ t has come back into his tr@@ ous@@ er .
It &apos;s not embarrassing , it &apos;s completely stupid .
Not really , in my opinion , the author takes the role of the typical British man who has always learned to bur@@ n his emotions and sha@@ ke his te@@ eth .
I &apos;@@ m sure if you are a K@@ ate Bush f@@ an , the announcement of his return on scene after 25 years of absence was something strong .
You &apos;@@ re aware that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights ?
I don &apos;t have &quot; the internet &quot; .
So I don &apos;t think I can comment .
Not having a computer .
My go@@ d , I have to see this mo@@ vi@@ e before dying !
I can &apos;t believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I have ever read !
Char@@ lie has just shown that he is at the top of the top of the co@@ sm@@ ic uni@@ verse that is sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I &apos;@@ m turning it off !
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter so that they finally have ill@@ um@@ in@@ ation and discover the incredible me@@ gu@@ r and insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us that lies in Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s ke@@ y@@ board as a div@@ ine light .
Good luck , it was really no .
Especially if it &apos;s not women or the tra@@ v@@ ail@@ s .
I &apos;@@ m a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive evolution within democracy : the rise of regional policies and effective community initiatives .
Until a new order , we confisc@@ ate the right to save our planet by states that play the tar@@ d@@ iness at every meeting to save the planet .
So we decide , citizens , to take things in hand .
With the Commissioner they have worked for energy , all these nice recommendations have been stolen ..@@ .@@ .
Tr@@ ust : E@@ olig@@ ans and firm sol@@ ves are tomorrow &apos;s R@@ on@@ d points .
All of this is financed by con@@ - tri@@ bes .
I beg you to stop this pro-@@ nuclear dis@@ course .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
The radio@@ activity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not fully controlled , it is better to limit ourselves to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is our only sal@@ vation , provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able electricity to fight CO2 emissions ?
France is not in any way affected .
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and ep@@ si@@ on for other steps .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity by wind or P@@ V renewable electricity is already more than G@@ ES on the other steps and especially gas , or worse of coal like in Germany , to compensate for the inter@@ mit@@ ability .
Re@@ placing nuclear power by wind or P@@ V@@ V would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Christianity I don &apos;t insult you , I &apos;@@ m a State Do@@ c@@ tor in physical sciences . 198@@ 1 I did nuclear physi@@ cs research . I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said .
For what I di@@ dn &apos;t say it &apos;s you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany . Nothing in fact did you answer what I was saying and as all the right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ish the interlocu@@ tor I never do it .
I also quote you experts man@@ dated by the German Government : Germany &apos;s current program of renewable energy sources is a non-@@ profitable and inefficient way to reduce G@@ ES emissions and should be stopped .
0 if you don &apos;t count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you don &apos;t count the v@@ ap@@ am v@@ ap@@ our of less effect than Co@@ 2 , it &apos;s true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power station is part of water and a little in the water . L@@ es .
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a &quot; giant of South Asia &quot; ... ! !
Last time , Pakistan won against H@@ undue .
It doesn &apos;t surprise me , most Indi@@ ans who ask comments do not want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan .
Ac@@ tually , it shows your state of mind .
It would have been the same if they had qualified the India of giant South Asia ...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate , but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply open a P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box full of corruption and ma@@ fia .
As for the I@@ SL , today &apos;s opening match has been surprisingly interesting , the Ath@@ le@@ tic@@ o of K@@ ol@@ k@@ ata imposing 3-@@ 0 against M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
Com@@ par@@ ing the billions and billions that India spends on I@@ PL and now in so@@ cc@@ er , how could we one day rival our &quot; no@@ is@@ y neighbors ... &quot;
The race at the L@@ ow Co@@ st pays cam@@ era .
It &apos;s a shame for such a beautiful project .
For the accident , the possible design default only manife@@ sts itself with a cold hel@@ m .
So maybe we &apos;@@ re not in a design default , but with implementation ...
Contrary to the ari@@ an@@ tism that is a private company , it seems that so@@ y@@ ou@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as the state is its own insu@@ rer .@@ .
They &apos;@@ ll be able to pay the satell@@ ites in a fri@@ g@@ ate who knows .@@ .
This is all the more anno@@ ying because many media take over the articles alone - and many read@@ ers only retain these ti@@ t@@ les .
All in all , it creates a false impression that is contrary to the content of the article itself .
completely agree with you , the title is not appropriate , it un@@ ju@@ stly calls into question the project when it &apos;s only a laun@@ cher problem .
