&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Mo@@ che is making a lot of change this point right now , quite a few things have changed , and they are preparing to change all the models of character ( so all the anim@@ ations , arm@@ ies , etc . , not the choice ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; History not interesting I leave you alone , I &apos;@@ m not interested , but I had some good feedback .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The argument that gave me an attempt is the immense &quot; tal@@ e of &quot; immense talent , which allows us to build the spo@@ il@@ t we want freely .
Ex@@ cep@@ t that if you find out about the forums , we realize that if we want to reach the lad@@ y lad@@ y , you need a bu@@ d right from the beginning , and the res@@ ha@@ le is so rela@@ xed that it &apos;s advisable to go back to a new person@@ o .
As the le@@ ague is sh@@ it , no thanks .
First of all , I don &apos;t know when you &apos;@@ ve tried the game , but the mo@@ l has changed a lot ( we &apos;@@ ve moved from doing three times the four men with different difficulties to ten acts only once , by personal , this says ) .
Then , it &apos;s true that in order to go far enough , we can &apos;t go to the pi@@ f .
But there are a lot of spo@@ ds that can do all the content ( actually , with the investment , almost everything ) .
internet gu@@ ides are not always very fair , or easy to reach for a deal , but there are things to do quite simple and very nice to play .
After , you have to be ready to learn a lot to play freely , it &apos;s very den@@ se , not very easy to access .
By the way , I come to your last point , if you now po@@ ke a tu@@ to , you have to admit that it &apos;s a horror to start .
and on the fl@@ as@@ que , you need to look at them like wit@@ ches in its own right , and unless I mis@@ understood what you say , there is not really al@@ chem@@ ist , and the class that uses the most the fl@@ as@@ que is hy@@ per .

If only the D@@ R@@ H were not subject to the needs of companies .
The social debate is a risk for business and so it &apos;s generally not by default ( &quot; why take the risk &quot; is the default solution ) , just as people visi@@ bly are seen as problematic , why take the risk when you can just say that they don &apos;t match the company &apos;s expectations ?
A modern box demands standard people who will provoke as little em@@ ul@@ ation as possible , it facilitate integration into the box to take &quot; standard &quot; employees ( that doesn &apos;t excludes minorities as long as they stay discre@@ et ) so why add a potential problem ?
Dis@@ crimin@@ ation &amp; C@@ ie is very anno@@ ying and risky for a private company , so avoiding the problem at the time of hi@@ ring .
Ed@@ it : And for &quot; &#91; ... &#93; Do not hope to find work ... &quot; Do not worry they can always work for U@@ ber / De@@ eli@@ ver@@ o , it &apos;s not a job where the employer is watching when his employees are passive .
It leaves a chance for the bul@@ l@@ ard who served his 10 years and decided to betra@@ y the rules of society more , but it also leaves the door open to the most vir@@ ulent , some political orientation / socie@@ tal orientation .

How to eat in time of French people and like the French ?
Already we have to eat at noon .
A real meal , not a s@@ and@@ w@@ ich on the chic@@ ken .
It is better for the main me@@ als to be the one at noon , not the one in the evening , contrary to what we usually do .
With a real meal in the st@@ om@@ ach , you &apos;@@ ll get less hungry or earlier .
Then nothing prevents taking a collection at 16@@ h or 17@@ h .
At worst , you can &apos;t even take a little case light at 18@@ h by coming home like 1 or 2 b@@ is@@ cu@@ its .
Nor do you want to cut off hunger and the risk is awa@@ ke your appe@@ ti@@ te and too much ( and badly ) eat at this time .
The quality of food also has a lot to do with the sen@@ s@@ ation of sa@@ ti@@ ety .
Gi@@ ving fat and protein to g@@ lu@@ ci@@ us makes it possible not to be hungry any longer .

In fact , privatization started at the end of the 1980s , after a period of fraud ( it &apos;s the country of the y@@ ak@@ u@@ za , we must not forget ) and a decrease in the number of passengers ( crisis forces ) .
So the government decided to start privatization by creating semi-@@ private companies by regions ( 6 ) .
But with still having the hand on it .
Moreover , it was early 2000 that some became completely private ( not all ! ) .
But in the end you still have the J@@ R group holding the 6 companies .
So you have a s@@ emb@@ l@@ ance of competition , but * in the end * it &apos;s the same company .
And then the Ministry of Ter@@ ri@@ str@@ ation , In@@ fra@@ structures , Transport and T@@ our@@ ism still has a word to say .
Japan is quite special because you always have a s@@ emb@@ l@@ ance of competition and privatization , but the state is never really far away .
