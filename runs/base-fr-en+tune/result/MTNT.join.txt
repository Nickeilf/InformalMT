The way we &apos;re at it is that there is a big project with lots of tasks .
I could charge to work or calculate a kind of package that they could spend .
I don &apos;t know what is best , I didn &apos;t like not too much counting the hours .
To motivate people to speak a language , the media is still what is most useful .
&gt; and it &apos;s almost only to keep France as a world power within the UN , which Macron , who had nothing to do with French-speaking in his electoral program , easily returns his jacket to show the other color .
But we don &apos;t care , as long as your interests agree , no ?
Thank you ! ( for the wish of a good day )

&gt; The blockchain makes it possible to dispense with this tier of confidence , in the vast majority of cases it &apos;s not useful so using a joke rather than a good vice DB is simple .
Except that your blockkchain is enough to be distributed to have third parties and to prevent minors changing it .
First option : a public joke , but I doubt that even Ethermm all support the flow of chickens from carrouff .
The other option is a private joke with why not minors who do not have to do a proof of work but be agitated by a central authority and there in any case there is the same confidence problem .
You hold a good concept of AskReddit , there &apos;s a karma to be made .

No , I already told you that the _ Donald was unequal : ) Then , in terms of hate and bullshit , there is indeed an equivalence between the left and the right .

72 % favorable / 28 % against &gt; &gt; To oppose reform of the SNCF , unions plan to organize a relic strike .
Does you seem justified or unjustified ?
63 % unjustified / 37 % justified &gt; &gt; The unions of Air France require a general wage increase of 6 % and call for a day of strike on March 23 .
Do you believe their legitimate claims ?
64 % No / 35 % yes / 1 % NPSP &gt; &gt; Do you think these movements of unions could lead to a complete blockage as in 1995 ?

The game is changing constantly , personally I like it a lot , so I &apos;ll when I &apos;m going to do it a little bit a bit .
&gt; Moche is making a lot of change this point right now , quite a few things have changed , and they are preparing to change all the models of character ( so all the animations , armies , etc . , not the choice ) .
&gt; History not interesting I leave you alone , I &apos;m not interested , but I had some good feedback .
&gt; The argument that gave me an attempt is the immense &quot; tale of &quot; immense talent , which allows us to build the spoilt we want freely .
Except that if you find out about the forums , we realize that if we want to reach the lady lady , you need a bud right from the beginning , and the reshale is so relaxed that it &apos;s advisable to go back to a new persono .
As the league is shit , no thanks .
First of all , I don &apos;t know when you &apos;ve tried the game , but the mol has changed a lot ( we &apos;ve moved from doing three times the four men with different difficulties to ten acts only once , by personal , this says ) .
Then , it &apos;s true that in order to go far enough , we can &apos;t go to the pif .
But there are a lot of spods that can do all the content ( actually , with the investment , almost everything ) .
internet guides are not always very fair , or easy to reach for a deal , but there are things to do quite simple and very nice to play .
After , you have to be ready to learn a lot to play freely , it &apos;s very dense , not very easy to access .
By the way , I come to your last point , if you now poke a tuto , you have to admit that it &apos;s a horror to start .
and on the flasque , you need to look at them like witches in its own right , and unless I misunderstood what you say , there is not really alchemist , and the class that uses the most the flasque is hyper .
( and the Video that you put , it looks hyper shit to play , I confirm ) .
After each of his gates , but I had to promote the game a little !
I was talking about from a technical point of view ( the scientific approach , how are the experiences ) because yes , there &apos;s no report we agree .

What are the magazines , sites , reference charts on the French / French-speaking E-gaming ?
I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a reference , but I like Gotaga , Skyroz , Millenium , Oserv Especially about Fortnite do other games as well Edit ; it &apos;s channels gang of balls that downvote .
An anti-trav brigade is rife in our streets &gt; Embracing a trans person ( whether or not he is qualified or not ) poses no concern if the latter has values compatible with the work that asked him .
If only the DRH were not subject to the needs of companies .
The social debate is a risk for business and so it &apos;s generally not by default ( &quot; why take the risk &quot; is the default solution ) , just as people visibly are seen as problematic , why take the risk when you can just say that they don &apos;t match the company &apos;s expectations ?
A modern box demands standard people who will provoke as little emulation as possible , it facilitate integration into the box to take &quot; standard &quot; employees ( that doesn &apos;t excludes minorities as long as they stay discreet ) so why add a potential problem ?
Discrimination &amp; Cie is very annoying and risky for a private company , so avoiding the problem at the time of hiring .
Edit : And for &quot; &#91; ... &#93; Do not hope to find work ... &quot; Do not worry they can always work for Uber / Deelivero , it &apos;s not a job where the employer is watching when his employees are passive .
It leaves a chance for the bullard who served his 10 years and decided to betray the rules of society more , but it also leaves the door open to the most virulent , some political orientation / societal orientation .
The final balance I &apos;m not able to judge but there is all everywhere and it &apos;s no more bad ( some won &apos;t agree , ok ) .

It is possible to measure this discrepancy ( for example : 13 seconds per month ) and to configure the PC to regularly re-settle the clock with the opposite discrepancy .

You &apos;re always saying , but firmly , no , you don &apos;t let them take photo , or you &apos;re shit from your house .
Even once it will be enough to send out the message .
The problem of families with people like &quot; The Tucks &quot; ( so almost all families ) , is that you can &apos;t PAS send out a nice message .

It leaves not a lot of time to be educated about dietics , study glypicic Index , the influence of such nights on health and take the time to look at the nutrition contributions of each product rather than direct directly to the promotional radius .
1 - The US administration has only to make itself a bastard and punish the owners of the big distribution if they try to transmit the cost of regulation at the price of buying their products . ( unlikely )
If we talk about rising prices on dietary depressed products , I see it as an idea to develop .
A dietary tax could even be used to tax bad products and lower the price of healthy products ( Supplementary to debate )
2a - following your logic , it can almost be said that all the regulation on the packages of clopes is useless because everyone knows that will lead to cancer .
3 - We can also just imagine that in the long term , a better nourished population will be more happy , productive , in better health , and that all this will be financially less on the rest of society .

* A guy who tells you to receive photos that make him dream and help him to get out for a moment from a daily that he finds ugly : 1 point * A guy who answers that these dreams are like kid , and that reality is worse than the ugly daily newspaper : score , 12 points of doubt , we &apos;re good in France .
Personally , when I &apos;m thinking of evicting myself in my imagination , I learned to do it either alone , or with my foreign friends .
I love my country , but fuck what we like to shoot others down .
Yeah finally I have telecoms you have Orange who deplores the majority of the fiber , who launches a lot of tests on 5G etc .
I looked at your 200 former contributions . It &apos;s just the sylilline phrases .
In short , it &apos;s hot air , not an argument you resemble at the coast in &quot; the unknown in the house &quot;
As much as the concept of France that oppresses its colonies and ille their raw materials , it sounds good , it reminds you of the history classes of Mrs michu in second place , but in concrete terms , what do you refer to ?
( I ask the question seriously right ) I don &apos;t really see how the peasant Auerergnat or the Breton fisher benefits from the money &quot; of others &quot; .
( Apart from the European subsidies , at the limit , but we created them for that very reason )
A lot of BT default can be anticipated or minimized more quickly !
&quot; There &apos;s no objectivity for women in France . &quot;
Make this bikini leoppard to your 40-year-old girl .
Yes she has no breasts , yes the leopard is vulgar , and then ? &quot;
You can &apos;t say anything anymore on r / france ... Here are the beautiful mm .
And automatic vickering of the semester when the blockages prevent classes for several weeks .
More seriously , because I was starting to bift on the troll &apos;s slope , I &apos;ll not call it a fair trial of intent in the measure or a post ( of menec-murder ) questioned me because it &apos;s amalgam between T. Ramadan , the Muslims in general and the conspiracy theory .
And all this applauded by high votes obviously .
So obviously it deserves correct , in my way , but correct .
We can practice your faith , don &apos;t know T. Ramadan , and refute any conspiracy theory .
Same that kills me to see the number of redditors who bring it back to railway workers , to strikes or to jokes on Trump ...

It &apos;s like a meeting Fesfo or what kind of gender
I thought that French people thought they were superior . And only 73 % admit it .
The French are false modest ...
Don &apos;t get a double face with him !
No , yes , bikes too can surprise it .
It &apos;s also for that reason that they have reserved paths , and otherwise , a little carillon to prevent pedestrians : I use and abuse when I move on bike , some think it &apos;s to say &quot; release &quot; whereas in fact it &apos;s to say &quot; attention , bike I &apos;m You saw but not you &quot; .
So the bikes , silent , have to make themselves heard by pedestrians .
Without jobs , you &apos;re going less on the market ( because the recruiter knows that you lose money if you don &apos;t accept ) .
If it &apos;s nice to negotiate 4 months it &apos;s completely possible ( especially with a move ) .
Or then negotiate two weeks without solicited leave using your leave balance of your previous employer is also possible .
When you ask you for dispos , you put on the table the fact that you have X weeks of notice + Y to solder , so in the hypothesis that you sign at the end of next week it would lead to ...
Finally , it &apos;s also a little too the excuse of the Americans who to accuse Clinton and the Democrats of having missed their campaign ... the fact is , a lot of herds voted like shit .
Faced with the CRIF , Macron refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . Given the star , it makes it more satano-maçonic .
He really teaches his mother &apos;s race your comment .
Already answered , you need to read the comments and watch the video until the end .
&gt; I admit , a guy who shouts &quot; dirty facho &quot; is perhaps actually a Mussolini admirer himself .
Stimulus so has publicly shown that you don &apos;t know what antifa means .
&gt; It &apos;s not a mirror , it &apos;s mostly the inconsistency of your part .
Ok , you don &apos;t know what inconsistency incoherence means .
&gt; It &apos;s not them who transfer them , they ask their friends SO or fliks to transfer them .
Antifas threaten physical violence , it &apos;s different .
And nothing allows you to assert with certainty that they are antifa .
I get the impression that you &apos;re left with people who think that this cull is made by you a processor .
Sorry to tell you , it doesn &apos;t work like that .
&gt; You should really watch the video .
We &apos;ll give you that you know you as a repeat of repeated ;
If it &apos;s done we now have to ponder the documents you consulted with what you obviously did not understand .
Fascism of fascist rabble-rousing does not make you an antifa .
You need the time to digest a name .
Also , what is funny is that the new names are sometimes tested on familiar animals .

Brittany is clearly forgotten in your list when it &apos;s shit .
Don &apos;t go to Nancy , honestly it &apos;s sad to die .
The fact that it is based on gold makes it independent of the monetary system based on &quot; artnette &quot; ( QE , printing money from central banks ) and especially the dollar , whose value depends on the oil market ( not enough gold US to guarantee the value of the currency ) .
Even conspiracy than with the CFA franc ... &gt; 2- The fact that a 2011 report coming precisely from the IMF ( under the presidency of DSK ) , which more or less confirms the viability of this alternative currency , represents a risk to the US dollar based mainly on oil transactions ( they have no Not enough gold to cover cash enough in traffic ) .
Grans risk for the dollar / s s .... ah , if you &apos;re really serious , you &apos;ll answer yourself even &quot; Dollar &quot; &gt; We now know that Syria was just coming after , and that it was going to be a big piece .
ALLELUIHA &gt; In any case , if there is one thing I &apos;m sure is that the war in Libya of Sarkosy was not in the interests of the French or of France , but in his own and that of his &quot; clan &quot; .
You will make the point to the families of the French 56 dead in the Libyan State attack , to the doctor and nurses from Bulgaria too .... : ) I &apos;m sure that putting an end to a regime or European national are tortured and raped , it &apos;s not in our interest / S .

How to eat in time of French people and like the French ?
Already we have to eat at noon .
A real meal , not a sandwich on the chicken .
It is better for the main meals to be the one at noon , not the one in the evening , contrary to what we usually do .
With a real meal in the stomach , you &apos;ll get less hungry or earlier .
Then nothing prevents taking a collection at 16h or 17h .
At worst , you can &apos;t even take a little case light at 18h by coming home like 1 or 2 biscuits .
Nor do you want to cut off hunger and the risk is awake your appetite and too much ( and badly ) eat at this time .
The quality of food also has a lot to do with the sensation of satiety .
Giving fat and protein to glucius makes it possible not to be hungry any longer .

It &apos;s really fun at the beginning and then I read on one of the cathos sites that are still selling this book : &quot; Pierre Duhousehold ( pseudonym of Father René Boisfroot , S.J. , 1898-1959 ) .

The moderators chose to take inspiration from French rules that , in my opinion , are better to maintain a calm debate and avoid all want to kill each other .

In fact , privatization started at the end of the 1980s , after a period of fraud ( it &apos;s the country of the yakuza , we must not forget ) and a decrease in the number of passengers ( crisis forces ) .
So the government decided to start privatization by creating semi-private companies by regions ( 6 ) .
But with still having the hand on it .
Moreover , it was early 2000 that some became completely private ( not all ! ) .
But in the end you still have the JR group holding the 6 companies .
So you have a semblance of competition , but * in the end * it &apos;s the same company .
And then the Ministry of Terristration , Infrastructures , Transport and Tourism still has a word to say .
Japan is quite special because you always have a semblance of competition and privatization , but the state is never really far away .
Whether it is voluntarily , or involuntary because politics is * very * friends with big companies .
&gt; It always posed my problem , people who take their kick protest .

Is there a consensus among the French population about immigration ?
The media are pro immigration yes .
I &apos;m differentiating &quot; I have the right &quot; = I can ask and do it , it &apos;s not forbidden ( and the person in front of too the right to refuse by elsewhere ) and the &quot; it &apos;s my right &quot; is , of course , my constitutional right = we can &apos;t refuse it .
In general a pro-IVG feminist committed to rather a tendency to listen to the second case of that it puts the word &quot; right &quot; in its sentence .
I &apos;m little left to leave the benefit of the doubt but I still feel that they &apos;re often hampering the word law when we talk about IVG as if she wanted to convince that it was really a constitutional right .

The 1 better : always the same heroes , but everyone has 3 specializations ( most of the SPS time CAC , DPS and tk ) , each specialization is characterized by active skills ( a dash dash station , an area station with a specific distance ... ) and passive capacity ( attack increased when you hit 3 enemies at the same time , full of constant pv on the duration , reduction of degates ... ) .
Also , you release talents ( specific to each specialization ) all five levels around .

Iiiish , the title of this article .
When you put his quote in context , there &apos;s really nothing to do with it : &quot; I never hesitate to express myself both in French , or in the language of the host country , or also English when it is on international scenes or in front of business circles , because I think That it reinforces the French-speaking .
It &apos;s very click-beast as the title .
Feminitto-reac methods , mode of employment
Daniel Schneiderman is in front of his screen .
He is preparing to watch a courteous show , excellent and intelligent produced by his new favorite media .
When suddenly , one of the invited people allows themselves to issue a headline hypothesis .
Wait , muddled , shocked that it happens on a leftist media , Daniel Schnidderman enquebles his social justice suit .
He devotes an editorial .
Who is this woman who dares to talk about women &apos;s bodies , March 8 , in the context of a show that could not avoid the Hashtag hashtag ( not Balance your Porc , I let you know why , you have 2 hours ) ?
Who is this perfidious who suddenly departs from the usual cliches ?
Would it be a sent from the Maaaaal ?
Super-Schneiderman investigation into for us !
And yes , poor leftist leftists who only wanted to confirm your bias : one person hides behind Marianne Durano .
Who ? Eugenius Yeu . Yes , Eugenigenie , you read well .
Maaaaal in person infiltrated our happy Happy .
How ? Marannine Durano and Eugenieu are working for the same journal .
They are therefore only one and the same person , one and the same idea , no autonomy of thought is possible .
On March 8 , a woman hides another woman .
She doesn &apos;t hide either Paul Piccartta the editor of the editor , neither Pierre Chase , the director of the publishing , nor Gaux Bès , the deputy director , nor Fricice Hadjadj nor any of the other members .
She doesn &apos;t replace Foucald , the theories of which she takes up .
No , she replaces eyebrows on Eugenius Basteau because she has the merit of being unknown to the battalion .
Few would never have been invited , she is not on the left , but we &apos;re sure she would have said exactly the same guy .
In a desire to objectivity to journalistic objectivity , with an undeniable taste for the contradictory debate , Daniel Schnderman does justice to women by wiping out his camouflaged things .
Thank you Daniel Schniderman for this great advance in this day of 8 March .
Thanks for this constant fight for freedom of expression and of plurality in the media .
