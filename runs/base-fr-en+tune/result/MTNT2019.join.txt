The functioning of medieval societies is a legacy of these older mythical and religious structures , there is a continuation .
As Westeros looks more like the Middle Ages , we &apos;ll think about it more easily .
Essss have some more antique guys , like slavery , cessons that make thinking about Rome and Greece , has the East .
I had only one experience of work , in a thrift , I had to accept and order for the staff , almost all of the time we were pressure and I didn &apos;t have the right to stop ( even after having to work 6-7 hours of displayed ) before having finished all the orders . Reports and deliveries .
At the beginning it was cool but hard , I was happy to do something else for once that stay at home , as well I was earning money and it made me do sports so it was all stupid .
When one day one of my colleagues with whom I worked and what would I say ?
You &apos;ll get your foot to do the orders .
He and me have never been heard despite my multiple attempts ( to share out the tasks ) .
At the end of the day , there were several orders and we also had to make the inventory of the fridge , so I tell her that I agree to make the inventory of the fridge if he does the rest of the orders .
He agrees .
I &apos;m finishing the work and go home .
Next Monday , I &apos;m called upon to say that there is a big problem that the orders that would have been made have not been made .
They are that my colleague had &quot; forgotten &quot; to do his job except that , instead of admitting him , he rejected the fault on me , I at the beginning did not understand what was going on , we were asked to go to do it in emergencies , in 15 minutes it was settled .
Then we told me in royal calm that everything was my fault and I &apos;m made redundant .
I am not particularly trying to fight ( the hotel was in court ) , I had a plane ticket programmed in 1 month to break off the island for 6 months , so it was moving some way and leaving me some time to move .
Nevertheless , I always have this betrayal , this betrayal , and for a first working experience it &apos;s really zero that it is over like that .
LREM &apos;s wet dream is coming true .

&gt; Well , not because once again , you deliberately ignore all the historical background of the thing , that is , a few thousand years of injustice men / women and a culture still machismic .
You can &apos;t make a law , a rule , without context .
Doing a box &quot; between white &quot; is the same , you would forget a few centuries of slaves of black people .
Your reasoning is not biased actually , it is dishonest because you refuse voluntarily to take into account the reality of today &apos;s society and its historical foundation because they don &apos;t favor your reasoning .
And you ignore all the historical background of segregation between men and women in favor of segregation as the only solution to the problem we &apos;re talking about .
And you blame me to extrapolate ?
You go completely against other solutions , pretending to have to espouse this one , because the situation makes it necessary .
But on an application that knows the identity of all speakers , who can know their position , who notes them , who receives comments from customers , etc .
Do you really think that there is really no solution only for segregation ?
And when I propose the port of weapon , you do not claim to oppose it for ideological reasons , like me , I oppose segregation for ideological reasons , but because it &apos;s forbidden .
But sexual discrimination is also banned !
&gt; Go , let &apos;s be crazy , propose .
Because here , so that you stop telling you on this tick box , the solution is that BlaBlai is proposing the same thing to men , which will serve only to dalle and will not make any progress at all , but solve your problem .
This statement shows that you don &apos;t read mine .
I don &apos;t want a case &quot; between men &quot; .
I do not want discrimination .
As Nelson Mandela did not want the black people against whites , he wanted the end of racism .
You &apos;re thinking so much about you that you don &apos;t realize that you can defend individuals .
It &apos;s not for fear of offending men that I &apos;m against , it &apos;s out of fear of offending everyone .
To strengthen gender discrimination in the 2 ways , prejudice , clichés , cultural differences that explain differences in access to power .
&gt; So if it happens , a &quot; Uber feminin &quot; in the state , it could perhaps make fun ( Edit : I specify : unfortunately , because no , basically I &apos;m not too much for this kind of thing , I just said that the simple fact that this measure is taken shows that The basic problem is real ) .
Ah well from the demos , obviously there would be .
The gender clichés have so permeated society .
You know that there would probably also also be strong demand for women doctors for women , for women &apos;s sports rooms , for cafés reserved for women , for women stores reserved for women , etc .
Is that what you want ?

As a reminder : we &apos;re told that the anti-ascée law will finally serve to stop the bad guys .
It is therefore necessary .
What we &apos;re not going to remember : crimes of aggression against physical person , aggression on the forces of order , voluntary violence , destruction of public furniture , coups and injuries exist .
That the gross crime is admissible as proof .
That the judge can already order preventive arrests if evidence of conspiracy of violence in band is made , like a call on Facebook , thanks to all the arsenal of emergency state that has integrated into the law .
So what is the need for this new , extremely liberticidal , authoritarian and authoritarian law to stop the casers ?
When such a law prevents the freedom to demonstrate without order of a judge , when the proceedings can only be exercised with the assistance of a lawyer post post , so that a judge assesses the correctness of the measure , that this appeal can last for years with the presumption of guilt in the meantime , When such a law hampers individual liberties , who can support it ?

You say that a carbon tax would not work because the population would reject it .
Illustration , yellow belts .
So my question is : when do you make such a statement , it &apos;s bad faith or ignorance ?
Macron tax the poor and redistribute to the rich .
It &apos;s strictly the opposite of what the consensus says to do .
It &apos;s not because Macron says it &apos;s a carbon tax that it &apos;s a carbon tax .
So , are you &quot; knowledge &quot; in economics not allowed to see the stron of macro ?
Ignorance ?
Or do you know very well the yellow belt does not oppose the carbon tax as described by the consensus but you pretend to confuse both in bad faith ?

&gt; tell me if you find somewhere an effective political entity that is rising in less than two months .
You transform the question .
I didn &apos;t ask for a political movement .
Just that they learn to demonstrate in the legality , without provoking scrap , that they learn to clean their rank among those who muddy their message .
Then if you really want to talk about a political movement , even if it hurts me to make them a pub , you have to recognize that they &apos;re moving quickly to work .
&gt; All the more because because of policies , it &apos;s what I explained , it &apos;s a movement that created itself in the defiance of representation .
&gt; We reap the will of our political classes to limit democracy to the vote .
The representation is not the fruit of the wishes of current policies .
It goes back much more and it &apos;s difficult to conjure for a country the size of France .
And especially the maintenance of the traditional operation of the 5th Republic was privileged by the majority of French people who had the opportunity to vote for a candidate who proposed an opening toward a 6th republic with fewer representation , professional assemblies , ... ( not perfect , but the least worst candidates in my opinion ) .
So no if we are still in the same system ( shit , we agree ) it &apos;s because of a choice of the people .
It &apos;s a puerile to put the blame on politicians .
Where , then , do you have to explain to me why rather than accusing .
&gt; The forces of order must respect a graduated response and not target your head .
We agree on this , and there are some bad elements in the police who will perhaps have done it express .
But I really think that in such a confusion you can find yourself touching the high part of someone &apos;s body without having targeted this place .
and it &apos;s true that there will be lais-pass for the police and that it &apos;s not normal .
&gt; The work of the police is also to protect the population , including the one that manifests itself .
Can she really protect the GJ cans if the protests are not declared ?

Wednesday I ended * * A short story of the time * Stephen Hawking .
As much as three quarters of the book made me feel smart because I understood everything , as much as the end , I don &apos;t have to give up a paragraph in the short run , or else we can start again !

Liseah did not really make any mistake , the PQ ended the same score as they started the campaign .
There was a slow rise to 24-25 % on the day of the 3 in debate and the PQ is back in 17-18 % this week .
I &apos;m still perplexed about the exit from Lisée during the 3rm debate .
He could have played it out and maybe the PQ could have gone back in 26-27 % , see CAQ the position of those who can beat the PLQ but the pro-CAQ narrative was firmly installed since the Louis-Hebert partial .
The Lisée plan did not work .
People did not want so much of a progressive social democratic alternative .
Those who vote on the left went to QS and Monic of Terregood to the CAQ .
He stayed at PQ for the sovereignists pure and hard .
I just hope that we &apos;ve learned of this , the time to be reasonable is over , QS has picked up young people by offering the most half-bak-baked program that I saw from my life ..

&gt; I would like to know how it &apos;s to find yourself a job in Quebec ? ( salary / requirements in general ) .
It &apos;s the job shortage in IT in Quebec and very easy to find work , even with &quot; just &quot; a DEC . If , for example , you want to be developer .Net you will not wait for so long so much is sought .
The salary will vary greatly depending on the employer : SMEs , Governance , consultants , etc .
You lose nothing to send your CV to know more .
That said , I invite you to look at the general package .
One of my regrets is to have worked at the beginning of the career in poorly organized SMEs with salaries that are not so interesting and not pension funds or other benefits .
Many SMEs boast about having a cool culture but going to propose ridiculous salary increases every year .
Take time to store , the market is at your advantage !
&gt; And if someone did a Dec-B-Bc computer path in IT , is it worth continuing ?
I have the same profile and I never regretted having a Bac .
The only thing is that in retrospect , I would have liked to do more software because it &apos;s more applied to what I &apos;m like .
The Bac in Info at Laval , at the time at the very least , counting lots of more theoretical classes not so interesting .
At Bac vs. DEC it really depends on what you want to do in the longer term .
It &apos;s not everyone who demands it , but having a Bac opens up more doors if you want to spend an Archtect day one day or to make the management of projects or other management positions .
Not if you have any other questions , I &apos;m in Quebec and I know the market well to recruit for more than 10 years ( well , I &apos;m getting older ) .

I just think it &apos;s a lack of sensitivity towards the victims and especially their families .
My indignation is more about the author of the pictures who wanted to do money with , I imagine .
I can only speculate about his real motives .
It &apos;s hard to imagine you who tragically lost one or loved ones and see pictures in a fiction work .
Not a reconstruct of so-called events to the news , not a documentary , not a movie on the subject but a completely detached thing .
People who give psychological and moral support to survivors always recommend avoiding news ballot papers for several weeks .
There are too big events to avoid them acutely , as 11 September mentioned earlier .
The families of the victims of 9 / 11 didn &apos;t watch * Flight 93 * , neither the French documentary on firefighters , nor the movie with Nic Cage , etc .
But if we used the pictures of the towers that scared out in a movie on apocalypse , they would be right to feel scorned or insulted .
For Bird Box &apos;s case , it &apos;s a sequence of what , barely 2 seconds , and still ?
But it &apos;s a bad thing for someone who lost his family in a monster accident and tries to distract himself with a good suspense of horror for in the middle of the movie to review the explosions that took him his wife or his children or friends ...
The problem is that laziness in fiction makes actions insensitive to their producers .

I &apos;m not thinking about your thinking .
I &apos;m interested in ideas , not people .
I think it &apos;s legitimate to have a fear about the immigration of people from other continents with other cultures and how to perceive the world .
It &apos;s even normal to see it there as wild people , it &apos;s a completely human reaction to preservation .
What is not like you or family-friendly awaits a fear , a curiosity seeing a rejection .
Especially when he can see some of the immigration problems ( the examples he gives ) .
I think it &apos;s legitimate for a population to have fears about immigration .
And I think it &apos;s less legitimate to mock them .
&gt; It &apos;s not arguments , it &apos;s bullshit .
It repeats , repeats and repeats again , when something is annoying , it &apos;s excited not to understand what it annoys it for the sole purpose of mapping out a message .
Sometimes it has interesting arguments .
And he is interested in a subject that is close to her heart .
We don &apos;t judge people who regularly post ecology for example , although it &apos;s close to them .
After the joke of debates , it &apos;s something else , everyone can interpret things differently .
&gt; It repeats , repeats and repeats again &#91; ... &#93; for the sole purpose of mapping out a message .
Ah , hold , another xenophobic girl !
Unbelievable , you &apos;re multiplying !
We must fear the great replacement ? &quot;
&gt; It &apos;s like the pub .
When you say , repeat , that in such a store it &apos;s cheaper , that there is such a reduction , etc . ; it &apos;s not arguments .
The goal of the message is not to be an argument .
The goal is to exist , and to occupy space .
Here , yes , we can agree .
&gt; There &apos;s no bottom .
There is nothing other than the expression of deep hatred of those he has identified as foreigners .
I think there is a fund .
He thinks immigration is not something Batiatique according to him .
So he tries to draw attention to what seems important to him and the negative side .
Not that he has a problem with people in particular ( like a French immigrant more than French ) but with the principle of multi-culturalism , demography and religion .
In fact , I don &apos;t know anything about it but it speaks to me in this respect .
I think a quote from one day on the forum to support my first point ( fortunately I was remembered for the name of the author ) .
&gt; The oldest attitude , which is probably based on solid psychological foundations since it tends to reappear at each of us when we are placed in an unanticipated situation , consists of repudiating cultural forms purely and simply : moral , religious , social , aesthetics , which are the most remote of those we identify with .
&quot; savage abides of wild , &quot; it &apos;s not from us , &quot; &quot; we should not allow this &quot; , etc ... , so many gross reactions that translate this same chilling , this same repulsion in the presence of ways of living , believe or think that we &apos;re alien to us .
Anticity , for example , was confusing everything that did not participate in Greek culture ( then Greco-Roman ) under the same name of barbarians ; Western civilisation then used the term wild in the same direction .
But behind these epithetes is the same judgment : it is likely that the barbaric word refers to the confusion and the inarticulation of the birds &apos; song , opposed to the meaning value of the human language ; and wild , which means &quot; forest &quot; , evokes a gender as well . Animal life as opposed to human culture .
&#91; ... &#93; &gt; This thought attitude , in which we reject &quot; wild &quot; ( or all those we choose to consider such ) outside of humanity , is precisely the most striking and instinctive attitude of these savages .
&#91; ... &#93; &gt; Humanity stops at the borders of the tribe , from the linguistic group , sometimes even from the village ; to such an extent that a large number of so-called primitive population names themselves a name that means &quot; men &quot; ( or sometimes - will we say with more discretion ? - &quot; Good &quot; , the &quot; excellent &quot; , the &quot; complete &quot; ) , implying that other tribes , groups or villages do not participate in the virtues or even human nature , but that they are all at most &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; bad guys &quot; , &quot; land monkeys &quot; or &quot; d &apos;Poor eggs . &quot;
We often go so far as to deprive the foreigner of this latter degree of reality by making a &quot; ghost &quot; or &quot; appearance &quot; .
For example , there are curious situations where two interlocutors are cruelly replicating .
In Grandes Antilles , a few years after the discovery of America , while Spaniards sent investigative commissions to search for if or not the indigenous people had soul , the latter used to immerge white prisoners , in order to check , through prolonged surveillance , if their corpse was prolonged . It was or not subject to puberfaction .
&#91; ... &#93; &gt; By refusing humanity to those who appear to be the most &quot; wild &quot; or &quot; barbarians &quot; of its representatives , we are only using them one of their typical attitudes .
The barbaric , it &apos;s the man who thinks in barbarity .
&gt; * * When you study such facts - and other areas of civilisation , like social institutions , art , religion , it would easily provide similar things . We &apos;ll just wonder if human societies do not define themselves , given their mutual relations , by a certain optimism Diversity beyond which they &apos;re not going to go , but below which they cannot , either , get out of danger . &quot;
&gt; More diversity , and it &apos;s relationship with other cultures that find themselves compromised .
Less diversity , and it &apos;s every culture itself that is in danger .
&#91; ... &#93; Too many differences , and the gap becomes insurmountable ; not enough differences , and identity dies .
* * &gt; I protest against the abuse of language by which , increasingly , we come to confuse racism and normal , legitimate attitudes even , in any case , inevitable .
Racism is a doctrine that claims to see in the intellectual and moral character attributed to a set of people the necessary effect of a common genetic heritage .
We can &apos;t fit under the same heading , or automatically blame the same prejudice the attitude of individuals or groups that their loyalty to certain values makes partially or completely insensitive to other values .
He isn &apos;t guilty of putting a way of living and thinking it above all the others and having little attraction to such or such whose kind of life , respectable in himself , is moving away by too much of the one we are traditionally attached to .
This relative incommunication may even represent the price to pay so that the values systems of each spiritual family or community remain , and find in their own funds the resources necessary for their renewal .
If as I have written elsewhere , there is a certain optimism among human societies beyond which they can &apos;t go , but below which they can no longer get out without danger , we must recognize that this diversity results for a large part of the desire of each culture to oppose those surrounding it . They don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t ignore them , they don &apos;t ignore them , they borrow on occasion , but in order not to perish , it must be that , under other reports , there is a certain impermeability .

There &apos;s nothing healthy in a debate where you ask as an argument to watch what whites did without them the world would be nothing .

&gt; For the fact that the Quebeckers are nice or not , everything depends on the attitude you have by traveling .
Yes , I already saw more warm , but the fact remains that the Quebecois stay in my top 3 side with nice ones .
Dear defined .
You have people that are super warm at first first but that you never link any link other than on the surface with them .
While you &apos;re less warm at the beginning , but that end up making friends for life .

For the 3 the context is still crucial .
4 : A debate / prove from a judicial point of view , in function I imagine the influence exercised by X on Y. But good , if it &apos;s not a murderer , it &apos;s collusion with murder / accessory to murder / yeah .
5 : there &apos;s no 5 bordel , I &apos;m disappointed .
6 : grey area , I imagine that by studying the level of awareness of risks ( like this X is unconsciously doubt or if we heard it say &quot; it &apos;s going to be over dozens and I don &apos;t care &quot; ) , we can consider the murder .
7 - 9 : no , but it &apos;s a ploy of level 2 .
10 : no , it &apos;s soft , but the cause-effect relationship is too difficult to establish .
11 : it &apos;s far too uncertain .
It &apos;s absolutely impossible to guarantee that an action will not lead to the death of anyone , just as the opposite is the patteron effect .
So you will always arrive at scenarios or you can argue that despite the potential risk of death of some , other more worthy actions on paper would ultimately present the same risk .

If you get your product from X + 3 to X + 236 , either your product is already expensive and the price increase to compensate for the tax will not be felt by consumers , or it will be too important for consumers to continue to offer themselves and back to an alternative .

From a person &apos;s point of view , I could easily have lauded Quebecois ( who could have also laugh about Montrealese as well , because I spent a winter in Montreal as well and it was nothing compared to winter in Quebec ) .
Secondly , as Albertain , I could have lauded Quebecois who cancelled all the plans , sports matches etc . Because of the road conditions &quot; so dangerous &quot; .
I haven &apos;t laughed , because I understand that it &apos;s careful not to take risks when you are not used to it .
But this storm has been like every other storm in meadows every year .
We live with , and myself , I conducted under the same conditions in cities , on the highway , in the mountains ( the worst ) almost always without winter tyres and always in a small char ( traction before ) and without incidents .
It &apos;s pretty easy , drive not like a stupid and conscious of the condition the road by testing the brakes often and when no one is close .
third , I lived in Edmonton several years .
It &apos;s bullshit your comment .
I admit that the city of Quebec is better than Edmonton ( Quebec also receives like 3x the snow ) , but Edmonton is good in drunk snow .
The capolate world only because the small residential streets ( the city has caused too much of it for urban outburst ) are not treated first .
But the city quickly releases the roads for buses and other main roads .
They manage snow effectively in Edmonton .
And finally your comment from the British Colbie-British has lots of mistakes .
You &apos;re talking about the Lower Mainland ( ie metro Vancouver ) and forget that the other million km \ \ <unk> 2 receives a lot of snow , especially in the mountains .
British people outside Vancouver are pretty used .
Better than several cities here .
Also , how many &quot; Chinese &quot; do you know of the west ?
I don &apos;t really know the situation in Vancouver , but Alberta has a bop of people of Chinese origin including second-generation second-generation people who are as competent as the others because they were born in Alberta .
Life is not impossible , if that &apos;s what you want to hear .
But you don &apos;t recommend being in the opposition , that &apos;s all .
Imagine that the government in France starts to conditioning your allocations or access to a particular good ( like gasoline ) to an identity card that would contain a whole lot of info on you like your political orientation , your income , your religion , etc .
Even if it does not affect the amount of allegiances , the government exploits your data like Google would do .
What would you think if Macron announced it tomorrow ?
mainstream newspapers are biased against Maduro , that &apos;s normal and that &apos;s what the majority in the West expects from them .
On the other hand , you will have to find me the false articles of Monde because it &apos;s not very complicated to slander Maduro , his politics can be criticized and it often happens to him to tell shit bullshit .
Maduro is not Chavez .
He will never get to the UN to criticize the POTUS with a shop of Chomsky in hand .
And then the situation in Venezuela goes a bit further than &quot; oil = intervention = American interference &quot; .
It &apos;s not entirely false , but it &apos;s simplistic and it won &apos;t convince a lot of people .
Hi Bienvenue12 ,

Let me laugh about it .

This attachment to anachronistic labels and this claim to lead people based on birth is pretty laughable , so I &apos;m fun .
It &apos;s very dishonest to say that all people who refuse to be installed at home do it by conspiracy .
Dissuspicion ( that is , who will use the data reported and how ? )
&gt; After all , herbicides is used in cereal monoculture and marshit mostly no ?
It &apos;s still a very large part of French agriculture .
And pesticides ( larger category ) are used everywhere , even in fish farming .
&gt; And I &apos;m not convinced that the shitty bottle offers a better balance in this matter .
I &apos;m also against the broellion &apos;s libel , which is an abomination .
After the problem of pesticides , it &apos;s that the area concerned is larger than that of the land of culture : dispersion by winds , water ...
And also the movie &quot; Behind the door &quot; .

&gt; But what about the extreme left and communism ( past and current , cif Venezuela ) ?
1 / La &quot; communism &quot; was only applied in poor countries , whose regimes were unstable , violent , it &apos;s to say in conspiracies where * all * the regimes fail .
The minimum to judge communism ( if as much as the countries that claimed it were , but I don &apos;t have the impression that the democracy and collective property by workers were the model applied , but let &apos;s go on ) would at least be tested by a favorite minimum .
Conversely , the extreme right , we have seen what it does in all imaginable circumstances , and it &apos;s every time an horror story .
That said ...
2 / ... I &apos;m not a communist , so good , I don &apos;t care a little .
3 / Venezuela has never been a communist country .
&gt; To go far away the Nazis were generally on the social left .
It &apos;s totally false .
There was no social progress , union ( it &apos;s even the opposite ) , or egalitarian under Nazism , and it &apos;s not because they added on the &quot; socialist &quot; end in their name that they conducted social policies ( Marxists were also their first victims in addition to Jews ) .
&gt; But it seemed deserve me because you &apos;ve just repeated only FN and not extreme LES .
I don &apos;t see the point of talking about the extreme left in France because it represents less than 1 % of voters , and the representation of her ideas , as well as being at the lowest possible level , is clearly declining by the world .
&gt; I can only ask myself what companies would do if the Nazis came to power nowadays .
They would do like they systematically * systematically * : they would collaborate in their overwhelming majority .
As far as we go to the right , the Capittal does not know any enemy .
We have an example of all costs with Bolssareo .

I just call OP &apos;s attention to the fact that it &apos;s a joke ( incidentally ) .
There is a margin between criticizing the management of the situation ( even to find it ridiculous ) and reproducing point for the point of a * * typical of facchosphere .
I want to concede that we don &apos;t really know who wrote that , nor his political convictions ; in the * better * cases , it &apos;s someone who &apos;s a little informed who takes back ( it &apos;s in the nature of * mammies * to be taken over ) a joke that has overstretched right up to the center . .
The probabilities that the author night a convinced leftist or a centrist ( really ) enlightened are almost nil .

It &apos;s not frankly a good plan to ask for a little more understanding and interpreted charity on the part of its opponents , while caricaturing them as much as possible by making shortcuts in all directions .
Well , on the other hand , it &apos;s a blatant post &quot; so &quot; .
It &apos;s not very effective or flexible .
It &apos;s a pis-go that serves well for the programs other than browser , but much lower than the use of UBlock OOOgin .

A subreddit of Quebecois who has not fallen badly in oblivion .

Yes , the article is terribly naked , and in the end , a super retrograde cultural elitism .
The author takes place as a cass cultural , the fantasized pedestal of the nineteenth century towards the supposed treasury of the XXeme , with the double cultural contempt of the XXe and his own family environment .

There are really different instructions .
In fact , the main method is to rally all the object of a single family together before cheating them .
The main part of the thing is explaining everything that we can have like &quot; I would not get rid of it because it can serve &quot; or how to throw its sleeves off or you get the impression that it is looking with their sad eyes .
It also talks about how to manage &quot; emotional &quot; objects ( like you have a ton of photo , how to triple them )
In short , quite a lot of psychology and bias that you &apos;ve got to then have some apartment in bazaar .

&gt; Before investing in a project we make budget capital .
&gt; &gt; We calculate the Valur Atule Nette ( VN ) , in English we call it the Net Present Valume ( NPV ) .
&gt; &gt; We discern future cash flow generated by investment based on a rate linked to inflation , the market and the risks .
To put it bluntly , can I find a hyper thing that is more profitable to shareholders than anything else would bring them back to them ?
If the project is profitable , we launch it .
&gt; &gt; You have 100 euros .
&gt; &gt; We propose two giants of oil .
&gt; &gt; In the first project you invest 100 euros .
&gt; &gt; You touch 0 euros in the first year .
&gt; You touch 0 euros in the second year .
&gt; You touch 120 euros the third year .
&gt; &gt; In the second project you invest 100 euros .
&gt; &gt; You touch 60 euros the first year .
&gt; You touch 50 euros the second year .
&gt; You touch 5 euros the third year .
&gt; &gt; What project do you choose ?
It depends on your RRR .
The Required Rate of Return .
The return rate on investment you require .
We also sometimes call it Open Cost of Capitalism .
&gt; &gt; The project is in competition with other projects that need tucks .
The RRR depends on 3 things :
&gt; Inflation : Every year the money loses its value .
&gt; The risk : If you propose a return rate of 5 % to invest in Tesla , you &apos;ll say no .
It &apos;s a bullshit .
Who says it &apos;s high RRR risk .
&gt; What the market offers : Because your fridge you could put it on the stock market or bank .
&gt; &gt; To return to our oil projects .
You thought well .
You find that it &apos;s moderately on .
You think that the RRR acceptable RRF because of inflation and risk is 7 % .
&gt; &gt; You do - 100 + ( 0 / 1.07 ) + ( 0 / 1.072 ) + ( 120 / 1.073 ) = -2.04
&gt; &gt; You do - 100 + ( 60 / 1.07 ) + ( 50 / 1.072 ) + ( 5 / 1.073 ) = 3.08
&gt; &gt; The first project is negative .
You lose frivolous .
&gt; &gt; The second project is the most profitable .
In view of this , it was not the case .
Why is it more profitable ?
Because with the second project the fridge is recovered the first year and the second year .
It is more reclaimed earlier in your pocket .
What does it mean ?
That you can put it immediately on the stock market or in other projects .
And that you will hit $ $ $ $ $ 1 anymore .
&gt; &gt; Regardless of the project you launch , you are moving in the direction of health , social and environmental consequences .
&gt; &gt; You plug the number that it will kill or seriously injure .
We &apos;re moving in this direction but completely .
&gt; &gt; The only thing that counts is to do the NPV .
Indeed , to calculate the NPV , you need a RRR rate .
RRR like Rate of Inflation , Risk , and Marklet Rate of Return .
This rate therefore includes the risk of losing frivolous .
The risk of being trampled underfoot , that you discover that you violate the law , that we ban your activity , that the entire population revolts .
The RRR includes everything .
TOUT .
If it &apos;s positive , we do it .
&gt; &gt; We don &apos;t care if it &apos;s destructive for the biodiversity of seed , if it kills the consumer , if it funds the illegal activities of Lafedischarge or if it accelerates climate change further .
&gt; &gt; It &apos;s why it makes me annoy that we hear &quot; oh companies destroy the environment by selling even more plastics . &quot;
or * &quot; Oh the guy CEO of Lafedischarge &quot;
&gt; &gt; When a major decision is taken , the only goal is that the capital cracks as much capital as possible .
Forget the page &quot; Valours &quot; of BNP Parilow or SFR .
These pages are addressed to the big public .
The only rule is not bankruptcy , no prison , DO IT .
All decisions in finance are based on that .
All .
We stop that if we lose fric or if we risk a judicial reaction hard ( not a minable fine ) , the destruction of the brand image ( = loss of frio ) or a violent political attack ( = loss of frio ) .
Cash is King .
&gt; &gt; If the government wants investments to no longer be made , then it must take tough measures .
In case of a violation of the law of extremely violent fines ( 10 , 20 billion euros ) or the seizure of force by the state .
It will increase RIG considerably , one of the important elements in the NPV calculation .
Investors will therefore refuse to put their fridge there .
The NPV is all that counts .
&gt; &gt; Pascal Quiry was elected better Professor of HEC Paris .
He wrote a book called Finance of Enterprise .
It &apos;s LE Rereference in Finance in France .
It explains the priority of a good business leader , it &apos;s constant research of the rente .
The rente depends on getting a majority of a market ( Microsoft ) , the agreements between companies ( Supporting the Intel / Apple / Pixar / Google agreements ) , the construction of a very strong brand ( Apple ) , the creation of a consumer contract ( Ecosystem ) or Additive products ) , the weakening and division of suppliers ( big brands and the textile industry , or Lacitis and milk sellers ) .
The rente is what allows us to increase the margins .
That &apos;s what makes the difference between the corner baker and a big entrepreneur like Bill Gates or Vincent Bolloré .
Regarding the famous letter to get the passport .
Two versions are opposed so .
Benalla &apos;s incompatible with that of Stzoda .
... or then , hypothesis that I am submitting to you and I &apos;ve heard you not heard by anyone ( and who may not be holding the road : did I laugh about things that would invalidate her ? ) : Is it possible for a 3rd character to make these 2 versions coexist ?
Is it possible for an employee of the Presidency to apply for a passport on behalf of Benalla , without warning his service at the time and without revealing that he was responsible as a result of the revelations in the Canard Enchained over the last few days ?
Stzoa would have said her truth last week , Benalla would have said her today .
This 3rd man mysteriously , a member of the organization organization of the Elysée , knows the truth but would prefer to keep quiet in the hope of not being affected by the scandal .
If necessary , is Benalla aware of this action from the beginning but only leaked it to justice , last week when we asked him the question for the first time ?
Would that happen , it &apos;s a possibility in your opinion ?

It &apos;s a good idea to believe it .
Except that from the day of the presidential elections , our favorite editorialists explained to us that the LR ponts and PS were going to leave to the European people , that he was going to let guys in a weak position plug all the shit to manage during Macron &apos;s state &apos;s grace , and then that He was going to recover everything for the final sprint .
We can have a candidate Xavier Bertrand , or even a Sarkozy .
We can have a candidate François Hollande or even Hidalgo or even Le Foll or Vallaud .
We can have a Hervé Moriin if Bayrou understands that he will never win and that we have to rejuvenate .
We can have Taubira at the PRG .
We can have a PC breakthrough or NPA .
We can have a countercurrent Philippot or Mégret .
Maybe someone will make Hamon understand that he doesn &apos;t have charisma and will get his place , like Aubry .
We can have a return from Eva Joly among the Green , or <unk> <unk> .

Moreover , the operation of Paradox is super , if the host of the part owns the DLCs of the game , for the time of the party , all players will be able to use them as well .

For Reddit ( and I know it doesn &apos;t work all the same time ) , I abstain from downvoting the world if I think they have a shit opinion , because they do contribute to the discussion ( even if not all opinions are equal ) .
So sarcasm or not ... we would not make them change their mind anyway .

Fast 20 years my primary and hearing the gang here who says that playing a mountain with the king ... We &apos;ve been watched by no match because we did not have the right of nothing .
Oh well .
Exactly .
Several of these points seem to be connected with an inability to guarantee water discharges ( or has a very high franchise ) :

In my humble opinion , another defeat at a major election will force the withdrawal of Marine Le Pen and allow Marion Mrechal &apos;s takeover of power ( who gave up Le Pen of his name ) .
As a result , LR will have been so massacred by LREM that we will attend the union of the Right on a neo-liberal basis .
It &apos;s the only scenario where I see this sensitivity to take power and it &apos;s unfortunately not impossible .
It must be even worse nowadays .
His statistics have been arrated under Hollande .
I had a chaux this week where we were still in the heat of the beginning of July when he was feeling 45c .

First of all , you need to cross the border already drunk , but also you to the authorities who can judge that you &apos;re not in danger in the meaning of the convention on refugees and go back to the country you &apos;re trying to flee .
A lot of the arrivals who make the request are sent back .

\ \ n &gt; Who isn &apos;t illegal it seems to me .
So if we talk about it , we &apos;re on the ground of morals .
Well , we know very well that there is a moral valve for lying ( especially in this case ) .
But it &apos;s partly the work of journalists to contrast with facts and facts .
We could really imagine a situation where someone makes an inaccurate statement and then gets correct by a journalist .
Here we could comment in a pedantic way about the inculture of the speaker without necessarily coming onto the ground of morals .
All this to say that not illegal does not imply that we are in a moral debate .
So I understand the affirmation of byroot .

I think we can avoid reading the article .
Also , all those who criticized Stéphane Foucart , why do you turn your eyes to a person who brings together much worse what you accuse Stéphane Foucart ?
A chance queues two grandmothers died , it saved me from a click on this article on dubious grounds .
Let me try to understand .
Add * counter-torcher * , basically , does it mean getting back to the tormented lunch in place ?
So the opinion of the anglos would be indifferent to the point where you will come back to give you the shit in place immediately after a first cleaning ?
&gt; not a situation with a guy where there has been no sexual contact .
It &apos;s not bad for some that there have already been cases of guys who send dikes to children and get stuck before having touched a child .

By the way , I like the legal mention for &quot; blockchain technology &quot; : shared registration device .
Since yes , France uses the blockchain technology as far as actions are concerned .
We also use smartcontract for the airlines .
Interesting to read someone from inside the machine .
I wouldn &apos;t have misery to understand how someone can go from CAQ to PQ and vice .
Could you that the identity questions had a big role played the device ?

I &apos;ve come back from the family to go back home on the 20 . There were so many verglas my virary and my wives were fucking ice by driving up ... and I &apos;m going to go over by trucks / autos / autos at 100-110 who find themselves in the chasm not long after I &apos;d like to get rid of it .

In me , yellow belts wanted to block the biggest commercial center in corner the first on Saturday ( a Leclerc with almost just Leclerc derivative in the market gallery so very few collateralized disgates
Then it &apos;s turned into round squatting point without ever coming back to this commercial center .
At least they don &apos;t come to embed rare tradesmen in the city center , they at least understood who was not the enemy .
I had this sensation because on the way out of the school of ingé it was a bit like that and with time you change and you want something else .
When I started to work on the other hand , it was not really the majority of profiles I was confronted with .
It &apos;s the cliché and surely also the visible part but I spent some good time with my colleagues when I was working in SSII to do various and varied activities , even with dumb dumps .
I don &apos;t have the impression that * &quot; discover new things , find me a nana , travel , make things &quot; * are incompatible with being developer ...
Some devils have passions and a couple life , if you &apos;re not happy where you work and you can allow it , there &apos;s no hesitation !
What age ?
Personally I did a VE , it &apos;s a good experience , in other words than a SSII for me and a bit of a trip , etc .
It was a good combo to discover other things !
Apart from a quote without quote on the English wiki of the series that says she holds an Guinness record , impossible to have anything to confirm .
What I realized when I searched a little , is that calculate an audience and a market sham etc . It &apos;s perhaps not as straight-fort and reliable that it looks ; so I imagine it &apos;s difficult to do more than an interesting anecdote and not an interesting anecdote .

And what is a racist passage ?
The speed of overshooting ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
It &apos;s good .
I know we &apos;re not on authenaha but the path of overshooting is reserved to go beyond to drive at the maximum speed of overshooting .
If you exceed no one as much as your speed has no business , the c is all .
Yes , speed must be modulated according to the road conditions , but it &apos;s not just for the way of overshooting .
Analysis when you go over you will always be or almost quickly than the limit .
It &apos;s the police and every driver to decide its security speed certainly not at a match or my oncle that blocks the left path to decide for others .
They can put someone outside for the reason they want , as long as it &apos;s not illegal .
98.5 just took advantage of this situation to react to a bunch of reacs .
It &apos;s an anecdotal event to say that a coop refused entry to a humorist because he had drunks , it &apos;s like , a perfect example of anecdote .

&gt; So it &apos;s a fun at the lot in the general population , but only the x % of the population that it suits will accept ?
Yes .
&gt; You &apos;re going to have an assembly that is vachely representative with that , it is worth making a tirage of the fate in the general population .
This , but without irony .
If you forces me to go to the AN , I will go to follow the rules but I will sabotage the work as much as I can , even if it hurts my fellow citizens .
( It will be done well , they will have put me there . )
Do you really hold that to this arbitrary representativeness ?
I &apos;m saying arbitrary because in your Assembly , you &apos;re not going to put children aged 2 or mentally ill , if ?
Yeah , too much bug under Saafi ( and this comment and yet posted since Saafi ) , it &apos;s perhaps the fault of the web developers and not the browser , but I regularly have sites that buck under Safari and when I pass under Chrome no problem .
I still use Saafi as the main browser ( if only for its integration with macOS and the functions of Hanooff macOS / iOS , Autofill SMS , etc . ) but I &apos;m opening Chrome as soon as I have to use a little heavy or soilful web application . .
The problem is that developers develop under Chrome ( because you have to admit drugs and other tools are great ) , test teens test in Chrome ( because he has 2 / 3 of the market part ) so it becomes the default by default that imposes the norm .
Rather , I &apos;m going to give Firefox a chance because , given the various comments , he would rather have evolved in the right direction .
I &apos;m not going to read the article because Judicth tramples me on the stratum .
But I &apos;m going to say what I said else compared to the pub Gillette :
The message was good , but multinationals use good causes as a marketing tool ( not because they believe it , just because it is going to make a shittw and so of the pub ) I get disgusted .
Especially as a moral level , Gillette can go back , Children and cement .

Good apparently , the gyphosate is closely monitoring , if you woke up very diluted quantity , it &apos;s really hyper toxic , the shi workers who were drinking water containing glyphosate didn &apos;t invent their sudden disease as soon as the appearance of the Gypphphate .
I don &apos;t understand the story of this discredited researcher .
Knowing the scientific method , I know very well that we can skilfully prove that the glyphosate is not dangerous if you omit things .
I don &apos;t understand those who defend the non-ban of glyphosate , those who defend those who are for glyphosate honor .
It &apos;s totally obvious that there is a Jerk pro glyphosate circuit with billions of dollars .
With medication , agriculture is the second biggest commercial power world power in one direction , it &apos;s as if you decided what salt would buy all humans on earth .
I mean , it &apos;s totally obvious that monsanto has a power ENORME power on studies , scientists are not a race to share from monks living in autarky in the mountains far from the world , there are good and bad things like everywhere , it &apos;s quite obvious that Monsanto has a lot of money . Very well , by far or by far , the scientists who are positive about the glyphosate are enquired about .
We talk about such money , it &apos;s colossal , it &apos;s colossal , it &apos;s a colossal customer , it &apos;s an official customer , all the countries are pushing and all countries need to rake the lands of weeds .
TOUS .
The sea-lane , the ré<unk> , the United States , in jaaon , I mean it is a market QUI VA PARTOUT .
It &apos;s limited if monsanto is not the only one with gasoline , it &apos;s unimaginable the power they have .
I see the scientists who say , well , I &apos;ve bothered all my life , I was integrated , only in my work , and suddenly I was offered the salary of 10 life like mine just to omit a detail and I assure me that it will be done so ably that my name is not my name will never be soulless ..
How do you want there to be no ones who refuse .
It &apos;s comparable with the invention of the washing machine has the wife in the housewife of the 60s , the thing will take you away from it in less than two while before you were supposed to have a job for dozens of hours .
ET UNSELE ENTREPROING SDAM THE MODE THE MOD .
Nan but my god .
With regard to the dangers .
It &apos;s quite clear that the thing is harmful .
I understand the gallery to ban it after years of use .
It &apos;s like telling you , the machine washed up is toxic , you have more access to the laundry now will have to go back to manual mode ..
Read to support the circlejerk with people who have at least been paid to say a lot of monsanto .
This report is just great .
If there are mistakes it &apos;s not serious .

&gt; The owners increase you you rent it when a wild estate decree before leaving ?
It &apos;s not a gift to me .
If they find a way to do it they will do it without asking questions .
I brought my daughter to the crèche this morning .
barely entry into the room where she is kept , a little approach and pushes her violently ( they all two and a half years or a half ) and she falls well 1 metre further , the head not far from a wooden structure .
There were three staff of the nursery in this room , including the manager , all for less than 10 children .
Not a single act .
So , as it was the third time that this boy was pushing my girl in front of me ( two times another day , without a big reaction either ) , it heat me and I started to give up the little , under the indifference of staff .
My daughter during that time was terrorized and didn &apos;t stop crying ( a child of her age , it easily pleases , but it was really violent as a push for the age of the boy ) .
By the way , I still told the directors that if it were to start again , I wanted to talk about it parents with the little boy , which &apos;s normal .
She replied &quot; oh , but you know , we already know , he doesn &apos;t do that like that with your daughter , he is followed by the psy , her parents know it &quot; ...
I answered in substance that I agree , but I would still like to talk to parents if it happens again and she got me out of a rather aggressive tone : &quot; Oh but outside the crèche &quot; as if I was going to get to work with them what .
That &apos;s a mole for the day .
Already because it &apos;s me who &apos;s a guy when women stay passive , and also because if it &apos;s not the first time , it &apos;s not the first time that the boy is pushing MA , even surely the case .
It could be good to keep up with it .
And if my daughter falls into a toy or the reboard of a table ?
Is it the time to talk about it when it will be crippled or worse ?
RAAAHhhhhh .
Thank you that &apos;s better
