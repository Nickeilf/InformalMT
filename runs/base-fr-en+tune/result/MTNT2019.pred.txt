The functioning of medi@@ ev@@ al societies is a legacy of these older my@@ th@@ ical and religious structures , there is a continuation .
As W@@ es@@ ter@@ os looks more like the Middle A@@ ges , we &apos;@@ ll think about it more easily .
Es@@ s@@ s@@ s have some more anti@@ que gu@@ ys , like slavery , c@@ ess@@ ons that make thinking about Rome and Greece , has the East .
I had only one experience of work , in a thri@@ ft , I had to accept and order for the staff , almost all of the time we were pressure and I di@@ dn &apos;t have the right to stop ( even after having to work 6-@@ 7 hours of displayed ) before having finished all the orders . Re@@ ports and deli@@ veries .
At the beginning it was co@@ ol but hard , I was happy to do something else for once that stay at home , as well I was earning money and it made me do sports so it was all stupid .
When one day one of my colleagues with whom I worked and what would I say ?
You &apos;@@ ll get your foot to do the orders .
He and me have never been heard despite my multiple attempts ( to share out the tasks ) .
At the end of the day , there were several orders and we also had to make the inven@@ tory of the fri@@ dge , so I tell her that I agree to make the inven@@ tory of the fri@@ dge if he does the rest of the orders .
He agrees .
I &apos;@@ m finishing the work and go home .
Next Monday , I &apos;@@ m called upon to say that there is a big problem that the orders that would have been made have not been made .
They are that my colleague had &quot; forgotten &quot; to do his job except that , instead of ad@@ mitting him , he rejected the fault on me , I at the beginning did not understand what was going on , we were asked to go to do it in emergencies , in 15 minutes it was settled .
Then we told me in ro@@ yal calm that everything was my fault and I &apos;@@ m made redundant .
I am not particularly trying to fight ( the ho@@ tel was in court ) , I had a plane ticket program@@ med in 1 month to break off the island for 6 months , so it was moving some way and leaving me some time to move .
Nevertheless , I always have this betra@@ yal , this betra@@ yal , and for a first working experience it &apos;s really zero that it is over like that .
L@@ RE@@ M &apos;s we@@ t dream is coming true .
Wa@@ ah , you tell me that I &apos;@@ m like Sch@@ i@@ ap@@ a ?

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Well , not because once again , you deliberately ignore all the historical background of the thing , that is , a few thousand years of injustice men / women and a culture still mach@@ is@@ m@@ ic .
You can &apos;t make a law , a rule , without context .
Do@@ ing a box &quot; between white &quot; is the same , you would forget a few centuries of sla@@ ves of black people .
Your reasoning is not biased actually , it is dis@@ honest because you refuse voluntarily to take into account the reality of today &apos;s society and its historical foundation because they don &apos;t favor your reasoning .
And you ignore all the historical background of segreg@@ ation between men and women in favor of segreg@@ ation as the only solution to the problem we &apos;@@ re talking about .
And you blame me to extra@@ pol@@ ate ?
You go completely against other solutions , pre@@ tending to have to es@@ p@@ ouse this one , because the situation makes it necessary .
But on an application that knows the identity of all speakers , who can know their position , who notes them , who receives comments from customers , etc .
Do you really think that there is really no solution only for segreg@@ ation ?
And when I propose the port of weapon , you do not claim to oppose it for ideological reasons , like me , I oppose segreg@@ ation for ideological reasons , but because it &apos;s forbidden .
But sexual discrimination is also banned !
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; G@@ o , let &apos;s be cra@@ zy , propose .
Because here , so that you stop telling you on this tic@@ k box , the solution is that B@@ la@@ B@@ la@@ i is proposing the same thing to men , which will serve only to d@@ al@@ le and will not make any progress at all , but solve your problem .
This statement shows that you don &apos;t read mine .
I don &apos;t want a case &quot; between men &quot; .
I do not want discrimination .
As N@@ elson Man@@ de@@ la did not want the black people against wh@@ ites , he wanted the end of racism .
You &apos;@@ re thinking so much about you that you don &apos;t realize that you can defend individuals .
It &apos;s not for fear of off@@ ending men that I &apos;@@ m against , it &apos;s out of fear of off@@ ending everyone .
To strengthen gender discrimination in the 2 ways , prejudice , c@@ lic@@ h@@ és , cultural differences that explain differences in access to power .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; So if it happens , a &quot; U@@ ber femin@@ in &quot; in the state , it could perhaps make fu@@ n ( Ed@@ it : I specify : unfortunately , because no , basically I &apos;@@ m not too much for this kind of thing , I just said that the simple fact that this measure is taken shows that The basic problem is real ) .
A@@ h well from the demo@@ s , obviously there would be .
The gender c@@ lic@@ h@@ és have so per@@ me@@ ated society .
You know that there would probably also also be strong demand for women doctors for women , for women &apos;s sports rooms , for c@@ af@@ és reserved for women , for women sto@@ res reserved for women , etc .
Is that what you want ?

As a reminder : we &apos;@@ re told that the anti-@@ as@@ c@@ é@@ e law will finally serve to stop the bad gu@@ ys .
It is therefore necessary .
What we &apos;@@ re not going to remember : crimes of aggression against physical person , aggression on the forces of order , voluntary violence , destruction of public fur@@ nit@@ ure , cou@@ ps and injuries exist .
That the gross crime is admissible as proof .
That the judge can already order preventive arrests if evidence of con@@ spir@@ acy of violence in band is made , like a call on Fac@@ e@@ book , thanks to all the arsen@@ al of emergency state that has integrated into the law .
So what is the need for this new , extremely liber@@ tici@@ dal , authoritarian and authoritarian law to stop the cas@@ ers ?
When such a law prevents the freedom to demonstrate without order of a judge , when the proceedings can only be exercised with the assistance of a lawyer post post , so that a judge ass@@ esses the correc@@ tness of the measure , that this appeal can last for years with the presum@@ ption of guilt in the meantime , When such a law ha@@ mp@@ ers individual liberties , who can support it ?

I think that in China , India and the United States they know about a radi@@ us when it comes to giving birth and I do not think they need our help there .

You say that a carbon tax would not work because the population would reject it .
Il@@ lu@@ str@@ ation , y@@ el@@ low bel@@ ts .
So my question is : when do you make such a statement , it &apos;s bad faith or ignorance ?
Mac@@ ron tax the poor and re@@ distribute to the rich .
It &apos;s strictly the opposite of what the consensus says to do .
It &apos;s not because Mac@@ ron says it &apos;s a carbon tax that it &apos;s a carbon tax .
So , are you &quot; knowledge &quot; in economics not allowed to see the str@@ on of mac@@ ro ?
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance ?
Or do you know very well the y@@ el@@ low bel@@ t does not oppose the carbon tax as described by the consensus but you pretend to confuse both in bad faith ?

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; tell me if you find somewhere an effective political entity that is rising in less than two months .
You transform the question .
I di@@ dn &apos;t ask for a political movement .
Just that they learn to demonstrate in the legality , without provo@@ king s@@ cra@@ p , that they learn to clean their r@@ ank among those who mud@@ dy their message .
Then if you really want to talk about a political movement , even if it hur@@ ts me to make them a pu@@ b , you have to recognize that they &apos;@@ re moving quickly to work .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; All the more because because of policies , it &apos;s what I explained , it &apos;s a movement that created itself in the de@@ fi@@ ance of representation .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; We reap the will of our political classes to limit democracy to the vote .
The representation is not the fruit of the wishes of current policies .
It goes back much more and it &apos;s difficult to con@@ j@@ ure for a country the size of France .
And especially the maintenance of the traditional operation of the 5@@ th Republic was privileged by the majority of French people who had the opportunity to vote for a candidate who proposed an opening toward a 6@@ th re@@ public with fewer representation , professional assemb@@ lies , ... ( not perfect , but the least worst candidates in my opinion ) .
So no if we are still in the same system ( sh@@ it , we agree ) it &apos;s because of a choice of the people .
It &apos;s a pu@@ er@@ ile to put the blame on politicians .
Where , then , do you have to explain to me why rather than acc@@ using .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The forces of order must respect a gradu@@ ated response and not target your head .
We agree on this , and there are some bad elements in the police who will perhaps have done it express .
But I really think that in such a confusion you can find yourself tou@@ ching the high part of someone &apos;s body without having targeted this place .
and it &apos;s true that there will be la@@ is@@ -@@ pass for the police and that it &apos;s not normal .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The work of the police is also to protect the population , including the one that manife@@ sts itself .
Can she really protect the G@@ J c@@ ans if the protests are not declared ?
Is what they give him the means to do the job they ask him ?
Is there not a certain degree of len@@ i@@ ency on the part of G@@ J with regard to the as@@ sign@@ ments and a desire to break with the forces of order ?
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; They destroyed social dialogue .
This to the as@@ sign@@ ment who down@@ votes me just because he doesn &apos;t agree with me .
We can obviously not even argue his point of view on an an@@ onymous forum without being si@@ len@@ ced by the first type that does not support his question the shape of the movement ... Y@@ e@@ ah , the policies that destroy the social dialogue .

It always depends on how much people are looking for .
A poor &quot; or or V@@ P@@ N + V@@ P@@ N + got obtained via gi@@ f@@ s bought via gi@@ f@@ s &quot; will largely be enough to the lam@@ b@@ da or the gu@@ y who wants to buy drugs on the internet .
But a real jo@@ ke an@@ onym@@ ity amounts to leading a double life , quite a lot of fri@@ es and time , and the slightest mistake can blow you up .
No , there are none .

First , I &apos;@@ m not very off@@ ended .
I just think it &apos;s a lack of sensitivity towards the victims and especially their families .
My indignation is more about the author of the pictures who wanted to do money with , I imagine .
I can only specul@@ ate about his real motives .
It &apos;s hard to imagine you who tra@@ gically lost one or loved ones and see pictures in a fic@@ tion work .
Not a re@@ construct of so-called events to the news , not a docu@@ mentary , not a mo@@ vi@@ e on the subject but a completely de@@ t@@ ached thing .
People who give psychological and moral support to survi@@ v@@ ors always recommend avoiding news ballot papers for several weeks .
There are too big events to avoid them ac@@ u@@ tely , as 11 September mentioned earlier .
The families of the victims of 9 / 11 di@@ dn &apos;t watch * F@@ light 93 * , neither the French docu@@ mentary on fire@@ fighters , nor the mo@@ vi@@ e with Ni@@ c C@@ age , etc .
But if we used the pictures of the tow@@ ers that sc@@ ared out in a mo@@ vi@@ e on apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se , they would be right to feel scor@@ ned or insul@@ ted .
For Bir@@ d Bo@@ x &apos;s case , it &apos;s a sequ@@ ence of what , barely 2 seconds , and still ?
But it &apos;s a bad thing for someone who lost his family in a mon@@ ster accident and tries to dis@@ tract himself with a good suspen@@ se of horror for in the middle of the mo@@ vi@@ e to review the explo@@ sions that took him his wife or his children or friends ...
The problem is that la@@ z@@ iness in fic@@ tion makes actions in@@ sensitive to their producers .
It &apos;s not obvious to make an explo@@ de of this intensity and it costs an arm .
Why not take a real ?
Well , maybe &quot; because people died &quot; could weigh a bit more in the balance .
No , clearly .
You need to say that it &apos;s mostly popular among the extreme right nationalist parties .

At the same time , being in Barcelona does not mean heat all year .

I &apos;@@ m not thinking about your thinking .
I &apos;@@ m interested in ideas , not people .
I think it &apos;s legitimate to have a fear about the immigration of people from other continents with other cultures and how to perceive the world .
It &apos;s even normal to see it there as wild people , it &apos;s a completely human reaction to preservation .
What is not like you or fam@@ il@@ y-@@ friendly awa@@ its a fear , a cu@@ ri@@ osity seeing a rejection .
Especially when he can see some of the immigration problems ( the examples he gives ) .
I think it &apos;s legitimate for a population to have fears about immigration .
And I think it &apos;s less legitimate to mo@@ ck them .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; It &apos;s not arguments , it &apos;s bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .

Sometimes it has interesting arguments .
And he is interested in a subject that is close to her heart .
We don &apos;t judge people who regularly post ec@@ ology for example , although it &apos;s close to them .
After the jo@@ ke of debates , it &apos;s something else , everyone can interpret things differently .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; It repe@@ ats , repe@@ ats and repe@@ ats again &#91; ... &#93; for the sole purpose of ma@@ pping out a message .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; It &apos;s like the pu@@ b .
When you say , repeat , that in such a store it &apos;s cheaper , that there is such a reduction , etc . ; it &apos;s not arguments .
The goal of the message is not to be an argument .
The goal is to exist , and to occupy space .
Here , yes , we can agree .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; There &apos;s no bottom .
There is nothing other than the expression of deep hatred of those he has identified as foreigners .
I think there is a fund .
He thinks immigration is not something B@@ ati@@ ati@@ que according to him .
So he tries to draw attention to what seems important to him and the negative side .
Not that he has a problem with people in particular ( like a French immigrant more than French ) but with the principle of multi-@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , demo@@ graphy and religion .
In fact , I don &apos;t know anything about it but it speaks to me in this respect .
I think a quote from one day on the forum to support my first point ( fortunately I was remembered for the name of the author ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The oldest attitude , which is probably based on solid psychological foundations since it tends to re@@ appear at each of us when we are placed in an un@@ anticipated situation , consists of repu@@ di@@ ating cultural forms purely and simply : moral , religious , social , a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , which are the most remote of those we identify with .
&quot; sav@@ age ab@@ i@@ des of wild , &quot; it &apos;s not from us , &quot; &quot; we should not allow this &quot; , etc ... , so many gross reactions that translate this same ch@@ illing , this same re@@ pul@@ sion in the presence of ways of living , believe or think that we &apos;@@ re ali@@ en to us .
An@@ tic@@ ity , for example , was confusing everything that did not participate in Greek culture ( then G@@ re@@ co-@@ Roman ) under the same name of bar@@ b@@ arians ; Western civilisation then used the term wild in the same direction .
But behind these ep@@ i@@ the@@ tes is the same judgment : it is likely that the barbaric word refers to the confusion and the in@@ articul@@ ation of the birds &apos; s@@ ong , opposed to the meaning value of the human language ; and wild , which means &quot; forest &quot; , ev@@ o@@ kes a gender as well . Animal life as opposed to human culture .
&#91; ... &#93; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; This thought attitude , in which we reject &quot; wild &quot; ( or all those we choose to consider such ) outside of humanity , is precisely the most striking and inst@@ inc@@ tive attitude of these sav@@ ages .
&#91; ... &#93; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; Human@@ ity stops at the borders of the tri@@ be , from the linguistic group , sometimes even from the village ; to such an extent that a large number of so-called pri@@ mi@@ tive population names themselves a name that means &quot; men &quot; ( or sometimes - will we say with more discretion ? - &quot; Good &quot; , the &quot; excellent &quot; , the &quot; complete &quot; ) , im@@ plying that other tri@@ bes , groups or villages do not participate in the virtu@@ es or even human nature , but that they are all at most &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; bad gu@@ ys &quot; , &quot; land mon@@ ke@@ ys &quot; or &quot; d &apos;@@ Po@@ or eggs . &quot;
We often go so far as to deprive the foreign@@ er of this latter degree of reality by making a &quot; gh@@ o@@ st &quot; or &quot; appearance &quot; .
For example , there are cu@@ ri@@ ous situations where two interlocu@@ tors are cruel@@ ly re@@ plic@@ ating .
In G@@ ran@@ des Anti@@ l@@ les , a few years after the discovery of America , while Span@@ i@@ ards sent investig@@ ative comm@@ issions to search for if or not the indigenous people had soul , the latter used to im@@ mer@@ ge white prisoners , in order to check , through prolonged surveillance , if their cor@@ p@@ se was prolonged . It was or not subject to pub@@ er@@ fac@@ tion .
&#91; ... &#93; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; By refusing humanity to those who appear to be the most &quot; wild &quot; or &quot; bar@@ b@@ arians &quot; of its representatives , we are only using them one of their typical attitudes .
The barbaric , it &apos;s the man who thinks in bar@@ b@@ arity .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; * * When you study such facts - and other areas of civilisation , like social institutions , art , religion , it would easily provide similar things . We &apos;@@ ll just wonder if human societies do not define themselves , given their mutual relations , by a certain optimis@@ m Di@@ versity beyond which they &apos;@@ re not going to go , but below which they cannot , either , get out of danger . &quot;
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; More diversity , and it &apos;s relationship with other cultures that find themselves compromised .
L@@ ess diversity , and it &apos;s every culture itself that is in danger .
&#91; ... &#93; Too many differences , and the gap becomes insur@@ moun@@ table ; not enough differences , and identity dies .
* * &@@ g@@ t@@ ; I protest against the abuse of language by which , increasingly , we come to confuse racism and normal , legitimate attitudes even , in any case , inevitable .
Racism is a doctrine that claims to see in the intellectual and moral character attributed to a set of people the necessary effect of a common genetic heritage .
We can &apos;t fit under the same heading , or automatically blame the same prejudice the attitude of individuals or groups that their loyalty to certain values makes partially or completely in@@ sensitive to other values .
He is@@ n &apos;t guilty of putting a way of living and thinking it above all the others and having little attr@@ action to such or such whose kind of life , respec@@ table in himself , is moving away by too much of the one we are traditionally attached to .
This relative in@@ communication may even represent the price to pay so that the values systems of each spiritual family or community remain , and find in their own funds the resources necessary for their renewal .
If as I have written elsewhere , there is a certain optimis@@ m among human societies beyond which they can &apos;t go , but below which they can no longer get out without danger , we must recognize that this diversity results for a large part of the desire of each culture to oppose those surrounding it . They don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t ignore them , they don &apos;t ignore them , they borrow on occasion , but in order not to per@@ ish , it must be that , under other reports , there is a certain im@@ per@@ me@@ ability .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; For the fact that the Qu@@ e@@ bec@@ kers are nice or not , everything depends on the attitude you have by travel@@ ing .

While you &apos;@@ re less warm at the beginning , but that end up making friends for life .

I just hope that this way of thinking about inequalities will be less and less widespread .
The context plays a lot but let &apos;s try !
1 - 3 : Yes .
For the 3 the context is still crucial .
4 : A debate / prove from a judicial point of view , in function I imagine the influence exercised by X on Y@@ . But good , if it &apos;s not a murde@@ rer , it &apos;s col@@ lu@@ sion with murder / acc@@ ess@@ ory to m@@ ur@@ der / ye@@ ah .
5 : there &apos;s no 5 bor@@ del , I &apos;@@ m disappointed .
6 : grey area , I imagine that by studying the level of awareness of risks ( like this X is un@@ consci@@ ously doubt or if we heard it say &quot; it &apos;s going to be over dozens and I don &apos;t care &quot; ) , we can consider the murder .
7 - 9 : no , but it &apos;s a p@@ lo@@ y of level 2 .
10 : no , it &apos;s soft , but the ca@@ us@@ e-@@ effect relationship is too difficult to establish .
11 : it &apos;s far too uncertain .
It &apos;s absolutely impossible to guarantee that an action will not lead to the death of anyone , just as the opposite is the pat@@ ter@@ on effect .
So you will always arrive at scenarios or you can argue that despite the potential risk of death of some , other more worthy actions on paper would ultimately present the same risk .
My response was specifically targeted at C@@ r@@ é@@ d@@ it I@@ mp@@ <unk> Research , not all the aid to the private sector .
Having said that , I am a little disappointed with down@@ votes received on my comment ( I don &apos;t target you specifically ) , while I only gave an opinion respectful .
If you get your product from X + 3 to X + 2@@ 36 , either your product is already expensive and the price increase to compensate for the tax will not be felt by consumers , or it will be too important for consumers to continue to offer themselves and back to an alternative .
If you want to lower the demand to increase &quot; only &quot; by 1.@@ 5 ° C , is it not better to ensure that the practices that jeopardise this objective are no longer possible ?
Do you want to continue making profit until it is no longer possible at all ?

Let me get rid of a lot of stereotypes that we find in this comment .
I &apos;@@ m pol@@ ite , so I ha@@ ven &apos;t la@@ ugh@@ ed at anyone in recent days when the world ( more specifically the media ) broke the &quot; storm of the century &quot; .
Well , we &apos;@@ re f@@ uc@@ king up !
First , I already saw worse several times in the year that I spent in Bas@@ -@@ Sain@@ t-@@ L@@ au@@ rent .
From a person &apos;s point of view , I could easily have lau@@ ded Qu@@ e@@ bec@@ o@@ is ( who could have also lau@@ gh about Mon@@ tre@@ al@@ ese as well , because I spent a winter in Mon@@ tre@@ al as well and it was nothing compared to winter in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c ) .
Secondly , as Al@@ ber@@ t@@ ain , I could have lau@@ ded Qu@@ e@@ bec@@ o@@ is who cancelled all the plans , sports matches etc . Because of the road conditions &quot; so dangerous &quot; .
I ha@@ ven &apos;t la@@ ugh@@ ed , because I understand that it &apos;s careful not to take risks when you are not used to it .
But this storm has been like every other storm in me@@ ad@@ ows every year .
We live with , and myself , I conducted under the same conditions in cities , on the high@@ way , in the mountains ( the worst ) almost always without winter ty@@ res and always in a small cha@@ r ( tr@@ action before ) and without incidents .
It &apos;s pretty easy , drive not like a stupid and conscious of the condition the road by testing the bra@@ kes often and when no one is close .
third , I lived in Ed@@ mon@@ ton several years .
It &apos;s bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it your comment .
I admit that the city of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c is better than Ed@@ mon@@ ton ( Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c also receives like 3@@ x the s@@ now ) , but Ed@@ mon@@ ton is good in d@@ run@@ k s@@ now .
The ca@@ pol@@ ate world only because the small residential streets ( the city has caused too much of it for urban out@@ bur@@ st ) are not treated first .
But the city quickly rele@@ ases the roads for buses and other main roads .
They manage s@@ now effectively in Ed@@ mon@@ ton .
And finally your comment from the British Col@@ bi@@ e-@@ British has lots of mistakes .
You &apos;@@ re talking about the L@@ ow@@ er Main@@ land ( ie me@@ tr@@ o V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver ) and forget that the other million km \ \ <unk> 2 receives a lot of s@@ now , especially in the mountains .
British people outside V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver are pretty used .
Better than several cities here .
Also , how many &quot; Chinese &quot; do you know of the west ?
I don &apos;t really know the situation in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , but Al@@ ber@@ ta has a bo@@ p of people of Chinese origin including second-@@ generation second-@@ generation people who are as competent as the others because they were born in Al@@ ber@@ ta .
Life is not impossible , if that &apos;s what you want to hear .
But you don &apos;t recommend being in the opposition , that &apos;s all .
Im@@ ag@@ ine that the government in France starts to condi@@ tioning your allocations or access to a particular good ( like g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine ) to an identity card that would contain a whole lot of inf@@ o on you like your political orientation , your income , your religion , etc .
Even if it does not affect the amount of al@@ legi@@ ances , the government explo@@ its your data like Google would do .
What would you think if Mac@@ ron announced it tomorrow ?
mainstream newspapers are biased against Mad@@ uro , that &apos;s normal and that &apos;s what the majority in the West expects from them .
On the other hand , you will have to find me the false articles of Mon@@ de because it &apos;s not very complicated to s@@ lander Mad@@ ur@@ o , his politics can be criticized and it often happens to him to tell sh@@ it bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
Mad@@ ur@@ o is not Cha@@ vez .
He will never get to the UN to critici@@ ze the P@@ O@@ T@@ US with a shop of Ch@@ om@@ sky in hand .
And then the situation in Venezuela goes a bit further than &quot; oil = intervention = American interference &quot; .
It &apos;s not entirely false , but it &apos;s simplistic and it won &apos;t convince a lot of people .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; To go far away the Naz@@ is were generally on the social left .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; But it seemed deserve me because you &apos;@@ ve just repeated only F@@ N and not extreme L@@ ES .
I don &apos;t see the point of talking about the extreme left in France because it represents less than 1 % of voters , and the representation of her ideas , as well as being at the lowest possible level , is clearly declining by the world .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; Before investing in a project we make budget capital .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We calculate the Val@@ ur A@@ tu@@ le N@@ et@@ te ( V@@ N ) , in English we call it the N@@ et Pres@@ ent V@@ alum@@ e ( N@@ P@@ V ) .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We dis@@ c@@ ern future cash flow generated by investment based on a rate linked to inflation , the market and the risks .
To put it bl@@ un@@ tly , can I find a hy@@ per thing that is more profitable to shareholders than anything else would bring them back to them ?
If the project is profitable , we laun@@ ch it .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You have 100 euros .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; We propose two gi@@ ants of oil .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; In the first project you invest 100 euros .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 0 euros in the first year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 0 euros in the second year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 120 euros the third year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; In the second project you invest 100 euros .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 60 euros the first year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 50 euros the second year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; You touch 5 euros the third year .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; What project do you choose ?
It depends on your R@@ R@@ R .
The Re@@ qui@@ red R@@ ate of R@@ et@@ ur@@ n .
The return rate on investment you require .
We also sometimes call it Op@@ en Co@@ st of Cap@@ it@@ alism .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The project is in competition with other projects that need t@@ uc@@ ks .
The R@@ R@@ R depends on 3 things :
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; In@@ f@@ lation : Every year the money loses its value .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; The risk : If you propose a return rate of 5 % to invest in T@@ es@@ la , you &apos;@@ ll say no .
It &apos;s a bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
Who says it &apos;s high R@@ R@@ R risk .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; What the market offers : Because your fri@@ dge you could put it on the stock market or bank .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; To return to our oil projects .
You thought well .
You find that it &apos;s moder@@ ately on .
You think that the R@@ R@@ R acceptable R@@ R@@ F because of inflation and risk is 7 % .

&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The first project is negative .
You lose fri@@ vol@@ ous .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The second project is the most profitable .
In view of this , it was not the case .
Why is it more profitable ?
Because with the second project the fri@@ dge is recovered the first year and the second year .
It is more rec@@ laim@@ ed earlier in your poc@@ ket .
What does it mean ?
That you can put it immediately on the stock market or in other projects .
And that you will hit $ $ $ $ $ 1 any@@ more .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; Reg@@ ar@@ dless of the project you launch , you are moving in the direction of health , social and environmental consequences .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; You plu@@ g the number that it will kill or seriously inj@@ ure .
We &apos;@@ re moving in this direction but completely .
&@@ g@@ t@@ ; &@@ g@@ t@@ ; The only thing that counts is to do the N@@ P@@ V .
Indeed , to calculate the N@@ P@@ V , you need a R@@ R@@ R rate .
R@@ R@@ R like R@@ ate of In@@ f@@ lation , R@@ is@@ k , and Mar@@ k@@ let R@@ ate of R@@ et@@ ur@@ n .
This rate therefore includes the risk of losing fri@@ vol@@ ous .
The risk of being tram@@ pled under@@ foot , that you discover that you violate the law , that we ban your activity , that the entire population revol@@ ts .
The R@@ R@@ R includes everything .

I brought my daughter to the cr@@ è@@ che this morning .
barely entry into the room where she is kept , a little approach and push@@ es her viol@@ ently ( they all two and a half years or a half ) and she falls well 1 me@@ tre further , the head not far from a wo@@ o@@ den structure .
There were three staff of the nur@@ ser@@ y in this room , including the manag@@ er , all for less than 10 children .
Not a single act .
So , as it was the third time that this bo@@ y was pushing my gir@@ l in front of me ( two times another day , without a big reaction either ) , it heat me and I started to give up the little , under the indifference of staff .
My daughter during that time was ter@@ r@@ ori@@ zed and di@@ dn &apos;t stop cr@@ ying ( a child of her age , it easily ple@@ ases , but it was really violent as a push for the age of the bo@@ y ) .
By the way , I still told the directors that if it were to start again , I wanted to talk about it parents with the little bo@@ y , which &apos;s normal .
She replied &quot; o@@ h , but you know , we already know , he doesn &apos;t do that like that with your daughter , he is followed by the p@@ sy , her parents know it &quot; ...
I answered in substance that I agree , but I would still like to talk to parents if it happens again and she got me out of a rather aggressive tone : &quot; O@@ h but outside the cr@@ è@@ che &quot; as if I was going to get to work with them what .
That &apos;s a mo@@ le for the day .
Already because it &apos;s me who &apos;s a gu@@ y when women stay passive , and also because if it &apos;s not the first time , it &apos;s not the first time that the bo@@ y is pushing M@@ A , even surely the case .
It could be good to keep up with it .
And if my daughter falls into a to@@ y or the re@@ board of a table ?
Is it the time to talk about it when it will be crip@@ pled or worse ?
