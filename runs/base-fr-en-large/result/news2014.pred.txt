S@@ pec@@ t@@ ul@@ a ’ s “ W@@ ing@@ er ” above Bo@@ go@@ ta
The sport@@ s@@ people J@@ hon@@ a@@ than F@@ lor@@ z s@@ acked a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter over Bo@@ go@@ ta , the Colombian capital .
E@@ qui@@ ded by a w@@ ing@@ er ( a combination of w@@ ings ) , it has risen to 160 km / h above the famous Mon@@ ser@@ r@@ ate sanc@@ tu@@ ary , located at more than 3 000 metres of al@@ titude , where many b@@ ad@@ als had gathered to observe his expl@@ oration .
A black box in your car ?
While the US road network pl@@ ann@@ ers find it difficult to find the money needed to repair the motor@@ way infrastructure , there are many who find a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the car scoreboard .
The appli@@ ances , which contain all the miles travelled by a driver and trans@@ mit information to officials , are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and government planning offices to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main US roads .
The sector usually without interest in planning the major a@@ xes has suddenly caused a heated debate and turbul@@ ent alliances .
The liber@@ alists have joined environmental groups in order to press for the government to use small bo@@ xes to keep the miles you par@@ k , and possibly the road you circul@@ ate , and then use information to draft a draft tax bill .
The Te@@ a Party is lan@@ ded .
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy .
And , while Cong@@ res@@ sional members cannot agree on whether to continue , several states have not waited .
They are looking for how , over the next decade , they can move to a system allowing drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled .
Th@@ ous@@ ands of motor@@ ists have already embarked on these black bo@@ xes , sometimes equipped with G@@ PS monitoring , for an experimental vice .
This is really essential for our nation .
“ It is not as if we had a choice , ” H@@ as@@ an I@@ k@@ ra@@ ta , Director General of the Sou@@ ther@@ ian Association of Go@@ ver@@ t@@ ments , says that the state is starting to register the miles that every Califor@@ n@@ ian motor@@ ist has travelled by 20@@ 25 .
There will be change in how we pay these taxes .
The technology is there to do so .
The pressure comes from the fact that the country ’ s High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund , financed with the taxes that Americans pay to the p@@ ump , is financially to dry .
Americans no longer buy more petrol than before .
C@@ ars can travel more miles with a gall@@ on .
The federal tax itself , which is 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has not increased for 20 years .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans are reluctant to increase the tax even by 1 100 , while petrol prices are high .
&apos;@@ The petrol tax is simply not tenable &apos; , said Le@@ e M@@ und@@ ich , a transport policy expert at Min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a University .
His state has recently inst@@ alled trac@@ tors on 500 cars to test a system of payment for the m@@ ould .
“ This is the most logical alternative in the long term , ” he said .
W@@ on@@ ks call this for use by kilome@@ tre .
It is no surprise that the idea is se@@ duc@@ ed by the urban liberals , as taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions , for example .
California pl@@ ann@@ ers are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the targets set in the ambitious state laws on global warming .
But representative Bill Sh@@ us@@ ster ( R@@ -@@ P@@ a ) , Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives , said that he also regarded him as the most viable alternative in the long term .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates of the free market in the Re@@ a@@ son Foundation also appreciate the idea of getting drivers to pay .
&apos;@@ It is not just a tax eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ing in a large black hole &apos; , it has declared A@@ dri@@ an Mo@@ ore , Vice-President of the policy at the Re@@ a@@ son Foundation .
People pay more directly for the benefits they are given .
The movement is also supported by two former US secre@@ tar@@ ies on Trans@@ ports who , in a 2011 report , urged Congress to move towards the m@@ ould .
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that would have been around 10 000 cars .
But the Presidency of the House killed the proposal , responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many m@@ asses every day to go to their work or city .
A number of states and cities nevertheless make progress on their side .
The most determined is O@@ reg@@ on , which mobilised 5 000 drivers to lead the country &apos;s most important experience .
These motor@@ ists will soon pay the state for kilome@@ tre fees instead of taxes on petrol .
The N@@ ev@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
The city of New York is considering one of them .
Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is testing a limited number of lorries .
And the I@@ -@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the US east coast ( including Mar@@ y@@ land , Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania , Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da ) is examining how it could implement change .
The concept is not a universal success .
In the N@@ ev@@ ada , where approximately 50 voluntary motor@@ ists recently equipped their car with a appli@@ ance , drivers were worried that the government could follow their own facts and gest@@ ures .
“ The concerns about Bi@@ g Bro@@ ther and this sort of thing are a big problem , ” said Al@@ ud@@ din K@@ han , who heads the strategic performance management at the N@@ ev@@ ada Department of Transport .
That is not something that people want .
From the start of the trial , the N@@ ev@@ ada ’ s AC@@ L@@ U warned on its site : “ It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full loc@@ alisation devices . ”
There is no need to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to keep people &apos;s daily record .
The N@@ ev@@ ada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car can be made , but without knowing the place or the exact hour .
If we can do that , he added K@@ han , the citizens will be more comfortable .
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-@@ up of California in the name of T@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
O@@ rig@@ in@@ ally , society was not intended to help drivers who pay taxes on the Member States .
It sought to go into the emerging market insurance market , in which drivers would pay according to their kilome@@ tre .
But the appli@@ ances that it tests have pl@@ agu@@ ed major a@@ xes because they do not use G@@ PS and provide a limited amount of information , perio@@ dic@@ ally down@@ loaded by mo@@ de@@ m .
&apos;@@ People will be more inclined to do this if you do not record their speed and not loc@@ ate them &apos; , said R@@ yan Mor@@ ris@@ on , Director-General of T@@ ue Mil@@ e@@ age .
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some states .
There are much cheaper ways and far less intru@@ sive methods to proceed .
In O@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers try experience by offering motor@@ ists different choices .
They can choose a apparatus with or without G@@ PS .
They can still choose not to have any apparatus at all , pref@@ erring instead to pay a for@@ k based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state .
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing aircraft to do more , rather than enough .
In the city of New York , transport officials seek to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for par@@ king costs , provide insurance insurance and create a set of real-@@ time data from other drivers that motor@@ ists could use to avoid congestion .
The motor@@ ists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits of the system , and has indicated a document on urban planning .
However , some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder whether the whole debate on the payment of miles is not just a huge dis@@ tr@@ action .
At Me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an Transport Commission of the San Franc@@ is@@ co Bay Bay , those responsible say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the High@@ way Tr@@ ust Fund by raising taxes on petrol .
A supplementary or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a great deal of petrol , so that everyone pays their fair share .
‘ There is no need to resort to radical sur@@ ger@@ y when we simply need aspir@@ in ’ , said R@@ ary R@@ en@@ sch@@ ler , the director of legislation and public affairs in the committee .
If we do that , hundreds of millions of motor@@ ists will worry about the protection of their privacy and a lot of other things .
David Bo@@ we : four new@@ com@@ ers listening
The English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an did not come over this year .
From the N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay , appeared in January , he co@@ o@@ ked a luxury rec@@ re@@ ation scheduled for 4 November , with several new ones .
Four have already emerged on the web .
The announcement of a new al@@ bu@@ m of David Bo@@ e left the whole picture .
On the day of its 6@@ 6@@ th birth@@ day , on 8 January 2013 , he said that a new al@@ bu@@ m would emerge in March .
After ten years of silence ( the last dis@@ sent , the date of 2003 ) and too few public appearances , the English mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an proved that it could still be relied on to split the po@@ p stage .
A f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans
Not tired of the sur@@ prises , David Bo@@ e had more of a turn in his ba@@ g with The N@@ ext .
Th@@ in White Du@@ ke therefore planned to re@@ produce this al@@ bu@@ m on 4 November .
On the occasion , he co@@ o@@ ked a real f@@ es@@ ti@@ val for his f@@ ans .
This re@@ edi@@ tion , entitled The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a , will be in the form of three dis@@ counts : the original al@@ bu@@ m , unprecedented se@@ di@@ o sessions and ref@@ ain@@ es , as well as a D@@ V@@ D containing the four cli@@ ps already revealed .
The N@@ ex@@ t D@@ ay Ex@@ tr@@ a will contain a total of ten additional ti@@ t@@ les compared with the original al@@ pine : the three pieces of the Del@@ u@@ x@@ a edi@@ tion , five s@@ ong@@ s specially revealed for the time and two .
David Bo@@ we made the presen@@ tations of this beautiful co@@ ff@@ in in a video .
It introduces both the record and the by-@@ products provided with : exclusive photo@@ graph@@ s and pockets , a car@@ net to share its own im@@ pres@@ sions , a book with words ...
And , above all , it gives a fore@@ taste of its new title At@@ om@@ ica , typically in the ve@@ in in The Nav@@ y D@@ ay , with very advanced gu@@ ides and well-@@ controlled ro@@ ck electricity .
E@@ sti@@ m@@ ates already listening
But At@@ om@@ ica is not alone in dis@@ covering its arms .
The In@@ formation , Li@@ ke A Ro@@ ke@@ et M@@ an , Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O are also available on the web .
The In@@ formation is double-@@ faced : a worrying tra@@ der before a light ca@@ val@@ ade that s@@ lows slowly to give way to a po@@ p bul@@ let .
Has Bo@@ ke , on Li@@ ke A Ro@@ k@@ and M@@ an , wanted to make a small reference to the Ro@@ ke@@ t M@@ an of El@@ ton John ?
With this title , the sing@@ er seems to be in his or her part when he no longer has his feet on earth .
S@@ pace O@@ d@@ di@@ ty , alongside it , was much more serious .
On Bor@@ n I@@ n A U@@ F@@ O , David Bo@@ e once again refers to his str@@ ang@@ ulation : would he come from another planet ?
The st@@ ren@@ tic@@ es@@ hi@@ p ri@@ ff@@ ers give an incentive to leave the Earth .
Bo@@ e , at any rate , is playing with the head@@ line with these ti@@ t@@ les : an informal turn , a man on board a roc@@ ket , a mar@@ ker potential ...
It conce@@ als and reveals at both times that different person@@ alities have been adopted , as he has done throughout his career , particularly with his charac@@ ters Z@@ i@@ ory St@@ ar@@ du@@ st and Al@@ addi@@ n S@@ ane .
It is hardly surprising that he has a hand in the photo@@ grap@@ h of the In@@ vi@@ ation in the V@@ y@@ age , the mark Lou@@ is V@@ u@@ it@@ ton , whose new face he embo@@ dies .
It will appear in one of their adverti@@ sements , broadcast from 10 November .
Defense Minister Ro@@ b Nichol@@ son insisted that the w@@ ounded soldiers were not released from the Canadian Ar@@ med For@@ ces , and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life .
Al@@ lowing the Liberals and the neo-@@ democrats in the House of Comm@@ ons , Mr Nichol@@ son assured that , before they were released , members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superi@@ ors .
All the injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life , and none of them is released before they are ready .
The critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured military - who do not meet the rule of &apos; the univers@@ ality of the army &apos; s service demanding that staff be able to carry out a series of different tasks - to reach the 10 years required for pension benefits .
In particular , they cited two cases reported by La Canadian , including a soldi@@ er released last Friday .
Corpor@@ al David H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , a London reser@@ vis@@ t in On@@ tari@@ o , reached post-@@ tra@@ u@@ matic stress syn@@ dro@@ me , has been released from the army despite its demand to remain another year in order to be able to receive full inde@@ xed pensions .
His case came after that of Corpor@@ al G@@ l@@ en Kir@@ v@@ aire , who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the rule of univers@@ ality of the service .
Mr H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins pointed out that a soldi@@ er could be prepared to leave , with plans and consultation meetings , but that this was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks .
&apos;@@ I told them that I was not ready &apos; , he said at an interview with the Pres@@ se Canad@@ ian Wednesday .
I asked for months if there was a way to stay , and they said no .
Since the beginning of the major fighting in Afghanistan , the army has been hard to determine how la@@ titude it can give to the injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but who are not .
Under current rules , seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover .
If they do not meet the criteria for deploy@@ ments abroad , they can be forced to leave the army .
Last year &apos;s data in Parliament indicate that , of the 12@@ 18 soldiers released for medical reasons , 19@@ 9 had not reached the service period required to obtain pension benefits .
The liberal spokesman for former combat@@ ants , J@@ im Kar@@ y@@ gi@@ ann@@ is , asked on Wednesday for the reintegration of Corpor@@ al H@@ aw@@ k@@ ins , while the neo-@@ democr@@ at J@@ ack Har@@ ris called for an immediate end to this shameful practice .
Dis@@ ney on t@@ ab@@ lets to launch a anim@@ ated series of anim@@ ated series
The Dis@@ ney Group Dis@@ ney has decided to favour t@@ ab@@ lets on its own television channels for the coming out of a new set of children .
The first nine episo@@ des of S@@ her@@ i@@ ff C@@ alli@@ ers Wil@@ d West will be available from 24 November on the w@@ at@@ ch@@ dis@@ ne@@ y@@ y@@ .@@ co@@ m site or through its application for tele@@ phones and t@@ ab@@ lets .
Its global launch on the Dis@@ ney Group &apos;s channels is only planned in 2014 , details the communi@@ qu@@ é of its Dis@@ ney J@@ uni@@ or division .
The child ’ s child , for children aged 2-@@ 7 , tells the ad@@ ven@@ tures of the Ch@@ alli@@ e , sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff of a town in the West American , where it puts order with a magic l@@ as@@ o .
Each episo@@ de has two stories of 11 minutes .
&apos;@@ Inter@@ acting with S@@ mar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es and t@@ ab@@ lets is a second nature for children today &apos; , commented on Al@@ bert Ch@@ en@@ g , Vice-President for digital products at Dis@@ ney / A@@ BC Tele@@ vision Group , quoted in the communi@@ qu@@ é .
This kind of experience between Dis@@ ney &apos;s efforts to &apos; extend the life of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important &apos; has added .
A poll published early this week by Comm@@ on Sen@@ se Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States : 38 % of the less than 2 years old have already been used by a ta@@ p or telephone , and 72 % of the less than eight years , compared with 10 % and 38 % two years ago .
S@@ now@@ den is prepared to “ cooperate ” with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers of the American intelligence services , said that he was prepared to go to Berlin to testi@@ fy to the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director K@@ e@@ ith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities .
The German MEP Hans@@ -@@ Christian Stra@@ ö@@ be@@ le met on Thursday Mr S@@ now@@ den in Russia , where he enjoys the right of asylum , to discuss his testi@@ mony in Germany .
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday , Mr S@@ now@@ den said : &apos; Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive , my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a flight and seeks to penalise political dis@@ course with accusations against which it is impossible to defend ourselves . &apos;
However , to say the truth is not a crime .
In his letter , Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against him .
In the case of the complaint by the American Ministry of Justice , he is accused of es@@ pion@@ age and the@@ ft of state assets .
Hans@@ -@@ Peter Fried@@ rich , the German Interior Minister , said in Z@@ e@@ it On@@ line : “ If Mr S@@ now@@ den is prepared to speak to German officials , we will make sure that we do that . ”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put under severe strain as a result of complaints that the N@@ SA has been listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
Thomas O@@ pe@@ net , the Member who heads the parliamentary group over@@ seeing the foreign secret services , has indicated that if there is a chance to hear Mr S@@ now@@ den as a witness &apos; without putting it at risk and completely ru@@ ining relations with the United States &apos; , then this should be taken advantage of .
Mr Stra@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a German Ver@@ de , published a pho@@ to of him with Mr S@@ now@@ den on his T@@ wit@@ ter account .
During his visit to Russia , he was accompanied by two German journalists .
Mr Stra@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that , according to the lawyer of the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant , Mr S@@ now@@ den could not return to Russia if he left the country .
If Mr S@@ now@@ den testi@@ fied in Germany , he should be assured that he would be &apos; security &apos; there , he said the Member .
Mr S@@ now@@ den wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a &apos; serious and sustained &apos; persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country .
However , he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to &apos; my act of political expression &apos; .
Citizens throughout the world and senior officials – including in the United States – found that the re@@ vel@@ ation of an in@@ explic@@ able system of permanent surveillance was of public uti@@ lity .
The letter puts forward an offer of cooperation with the German authorities &apos; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved &apos; .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able may soon offer an inter@@ active television station
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able subscri@@ bers may well have access to applications like Fac@@ e@@ book , T@@ wit@@ ter , and , ultimately , the video service on request for Net@@ works via their television in a future that does not seem so distant .
The Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it was currently conducting preliminary tests in the b@@ et@@ a version of this platform with some of its users .
&apos;@@ This will enable us to develop more us@@ er-@@ friendly inter@@ faces and more options &apos; , explained the President and head of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , Lou@@ is Au@@ d@@ let , in meeting .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able is taking the step to its competitors , like Bel@@ l , even if Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform .
&apos;@@ We must adapt and change or resist change and fail &apos; .
The ultimate aim remains to provide tools to which our customers do not have access at present .
The telec@@ oms giant Ro@@ g@@ ers has already indicated that he could offer Net@@ work if certain technical details , which were not mentioned , could be resolved .
In the United States , the video service for video is saying to be in talks with some major c@@ ables so that its service is available via their broadcasting platforms .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o and Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able also welcomed the announcement by the Har@@ per government in its T@@ en@@ ne speech on 16 October .
Ot@@ ta@@ wa wants to force c@@ able and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay the services at the card .
&apos;@@ It has been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains is not working &apos; , has said Mr Aud@@ let .
However , it hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian radio and telecommunications Council ( C@@ R@@ T@@ C ) will lead to interesting recommendations .
&apos;@@ It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television &apos; , which has been said by Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o .
The R@@ R@@ T@@ C has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and they should continue with industry next spring .
On the results , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o indicated that he had a net benefit of 4@@ 3.@@ 8 million in the fourth quarter , or 82 .
This is a reduction compared to the net benefit of 4@@ 4.@@ 9 million , or 83 out of action , of the same period last year .
The company established in Mon@@ tre@@ al explains this decline with costs of depreci@@ ation linked to new acquis@@ i@@ tions .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o , in 2012 , acquired the E@@ Atlantic Bro@@ ad@@ distribu@@ tor , established in the United States , for 1.@@ 36 billion .
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal .
Last December , Nep@@ al@@ ese society also bought Pe@@ er 1 Network En@@ ter@@ prise , an Internet provider established in V@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver , for the sum of 5@@ 26 million .
As for Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o ’ s income , they grew by 4@@ 1.5 % in the fourth quarter to 50@@ 4.@@ 7 million .
They are 1.@@ 8 billion for the current financial year .
The net benefit of its main subsidiary , Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able , was 4@@ 3.@@ 9 million , or 90 per action , in decline compared to the 4@@ 5.@@ 7 million , or 93 .
Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able incomes , however , increased by 45 % to 4@@ 7@@ 0.@@ 4 million .
The company lost 15 2@@ 37 customers in the fourth quarter .
However , for the financial year 2013 , the number of Co@@ g@@ ec@@ o C@@ able customers is rising 5@@ 5@@ 46 .
Mr Aud@@ let is not concerned that the number of customers is fluctu@@ ating in this way .
As far as I am concerned , it is not an indication of a change of trend .
This varies from one quarter to the other with very strong competition .
From horse to horse in beef products
From horse meat to can@@ ned bo@@ xes of beef products , sold by two small British low-@@ pric@@ e-@@ distribution teachers , the food hygiene agency has now been announced .
routine tests have revealed that the products , drawn up in January in Romania and sold by the H@@ me Bar@@ g@@ ain and Qu@@ ali@@ ty Sa@@ ve chains , contained the DNA of horse 1 to 5 % .
&apos;@@ Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients , it should not have been present in the product &apos; , explained the UK agency .
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in co@@ ff@@ in gra@@ ves erup@@ ted in Europe at the beginning of the year , following tests in Ireland .
According to European Commission exam@@ inations , France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef .
A col@@ lis@@ ion between two vehicles caused four injured , early on Friday , on road 1@@ 31 in Lan@@ audi@@ a .
S@@ hor@@ tly before 4@@ th , a motor@@ ist who wal@@ ked in the north , in Sain@@ t-@@ F@@ é@@ e de Val@@ o@@ is , lost control of his vehicle and survived a car that went in the opposite direction .
The four occup@@ ants of both vehicles were injured , but there was no fear for their lives .
Tra@@ ffic had returned to normal until 6.@@ 00 on Friday .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines envisage paying hand lu@@ gg@@ age
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines are planning to pay up to $ 100 to passengers carrying hand@@ bag@@ s on their flights .
Fron@@ tier Air@@ lines intend to start paying up to $ 100 for hand@@ bag@@ s and $ 2 for a coffee or a so@@ da , although in its announcement on Wednesday , it indicated that passengers could take the un@@ open channel with them .
New hand lu@@ gg@@ age costs relate to bag@@ s in the higher compar@@ tment , so small bag@@ s inst@@ alled under the seat will always be free .
Fron@@ tier said that she would pay $ 25 if the costs were paid in advance and $ 100 if travellers paid only once at the bo@@ arding door .
The Fron@@ tier spokesman , K@@ ate O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , indicated that the $ 100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance .
“ We do not want to make this prize pay , ” she explained .
The airlines began to make the first and second b@@ agg@@ age recorded in 2008 .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers who were trying to avoid these costs had as many things as they could in hand lu@@ gg@@ age in higher compar@@ tments , so there was often no room in these compar@@ tments .
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry less on board .
Mal@@ ley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money .
It is a question of making it easier to find a place in higher compar@@ tments to the clients of Fron@@ tier Fron@@ tier customers .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers buying their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay .
So a passenger flying at a bo@@ arding door could transport a ba@@ g free , while the next person in the qu@@ e@@ ue could pay $ 100 for a similar ba@@ g .
Mal@@ ley explained that the Fron@@ tier site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these charges before arriving at the door .
Fron@@ tier lu@@ gg@@ age costs will not be applied before the summer , although no date has been set .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers often fly on charges of lu@@ gg@@ age and other costs , but the airlines ad@@ mire them .
They believe that lu@@ gg@@ age costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it .
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of lu@@ gg@@ age charges to be a sign that airlines are paying enough for the cost of air travel after years of losses .
Yet many of them did not hit the cost of lu@@ gg@@ age .
S@@ pi@@ t Air@@ lines In@@ c@@ és had applied the first hand lu@@ gg@@ age charges three years ago , and the company of the low-cost Al@@ gi@@ gi@@ ant was later followed .
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian company Wi@@ z@@ z Air , which has declared the consul@@ tant to airlines J@@ ary S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , which is closely following the costs .
In a report in December 2011 , he estimated that S@@ pi@@ rit ’ s hand lu@@ gg@@ age costs were $ 50 per year .
S@@ or@@ en@@ sen , a former framework of Mid@@ west Air@@ lines , recently travel@@ ed on S@@ pi@@ rit and won@@ dered what it would find at the bo@@ arding door at a time when passengers would discover the un@@ familiar charge charges imposed by the company .
&quot; I had never seen a bo@@ arding procedure in my entire professional career &quot; .
I had expected to see te@@ eth and a b@@ right b@@ reath .
The plane was full , he added , &apos; passengers were raised at the speed of the ligh@@ ter &apos; .
Fron@@ tier also does like S@@ pi@@ rit and applies $ 2 for a coffee , a po@@ t , a so@@ da or a fruit ju@@ ice .
Fron@@ tier has indicated that passengers who take a be@@ e or a fruit ju@@ ice can take the un@@ open channel with them , and those who take coffee can be left free .
It will always distribute water free of charge .
US Air@@ ways tried briefly to pay for the drinks in 2008 , but went back seven months later after passengers complained , and then no other large airline had followed .
The Fron@@ tier decision to charge hand lu@@ gg@@ age costs when passengers do not directly purchase their ticket from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go on their site .
Air@@ lines pay online travel ven@@ d@@ ors like Or@@ bi@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for every ticket sold .
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency .
However , Fron@@ tier has gone further in this area .
In September , it began to offer only half the miles of loyalty to customers buying their ticket via an online travel agency .
On Wednesday , it reduced the mine premiums by 25 % on a journey .
For example , a 10@@ 1@@ ,000 miles away from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles .
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Fron@@ tier site .
Fron@@ tier has a faithful customer in his home town , Den@@ ver , but his activity is falling and is losing money .
The revenue fell by 9 % and its flight capacity fell by almost 13 % in the first quarter , according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company , Re@@ public Air@@ ways Hol@@ ways H@@ holdings In@@ c .
Re@@ public has tried to repair the Fron@@ tier finances by selling the airline .
The N@@ SA calls into question an &apos; internal error &apos; and not computer pir@@ ates
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said on Friday that it was a bu@@ g that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours , not ha@@ c@@ kers as some had claimed online .
&apos;@@ N@@ SA@@ .@@ go@@ v has remained in@@ accessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that took place during a planned update &apos; , indicated the es@@ pion@@ age agency in a statement by em@@ ail .
The problem will be resolved this evening .
The allegations that the breakdown was due to an attack on the denial of services distributed &#91; D@@ S@@ D &#93; are wrong .
Ear@@ lier this evening , the trac@@ es of online ser@@ vers noted that the N@@ SA site had been st@@ alled for at least 6 hours , and some users still cannot access the site .
Ear@@ lier , a N@@ SA spokesman told A@@ BC Ne@@ ws that the agency &apos;s sensitive internal network was &apos; not at all &apos; .
No classified information is in jeop@@ ar@@ dy , explained the spokesman .
At least a group of online ha@@ c@@ kers claimed to be responsible for the N@@ SA ’ s breakdown by a D@@ S@@ D attack .
The D@@ S@@ D attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the ser@@ vers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
Cy@@ ber tactics are not very sophisticated , and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the targeted system .
The formerly ultra-@@ secret N@@ SA , a time called “ N@@ o Su@@ ch Agency , ” found itself under the spot@@ light and strongly criticised in recent months following a wave of re@@ vel@@ ations about its vast communications surveillance programs at national and foreign level – which form part of the N@@ SA ’ s secret files .
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has caused a lot of speculation that this evening &apos;s incident was the result of targeted cyber@@ -@@ operation .
The Del@@ ta C@@ enter now closed
The Del@@ ta C@@ enter City closed its doors on Thursday in Mon@@ tre@@ al , after 36 years of existence .
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to develop@@ ers who are going to turn it into student homes .
Three hundred people were working at the ho@@ tel .
Of these , 200 have still not found new jobs .
Del@@ ta promises not to let its employees fall .
Emp@@ loy@@ ers have come to meet workers directly on the ground , and individual employees have been met to assess their needs .
&apos;@@ This will continue for the next six months &apos; , explains the regional director of the H@@ ec@@ t@@ as Del@@ ta , F@@ é@@ li@@ x Bay .
The closure of the Del@@ ta comes in a very competitive ho@@ tel market .
The investment fund that was owned by this building had choices to be made .
Either he re@@ invested in the building to continue to operate , so there were investments of tens of millions when competition is very fierce , there are many new hot@@ els that appeared in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
&apos;@@ Either he was selling it to someone else , and that is what has happened &apos; , explains Paul Ar@@ sen@@ ult , who own@@ s the D@@ ac@@ at Tourism Cha@@ ir@@ men at the E@@ Q@@ A@@ M Management Science Scho@@ ol .
Other hot@@ els in Mon@@ tre@@ al will also be converted in the coming months , such as the C@@ la@@ za P@@ la@@ za , which will become a residence for the elderly .
In the meantime , four ho@@ tel projects tot@@ alling almost 600 cham@@ bers will be born in two years &apos; time .
For the CE@@ O in Ti@@ tan , &apos; Go@@ od@@ s@@ é@@ ar A@@ mi@@ ens &apos; is starting with zero employed . &apos;
Having thrown the str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold in January for the partial recovery of the Go@@ od@@ é@@ ar of North &apos;@@ A@@ mile promised to closure , M@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us T@@ ay@@ l@@ or , the US ty@@ re of the US ty@@ re Ti@@ tan , is now prepared to save 3@@ 33 jobs from the plant .
Ar@@ na@@ ud Mon@@ te@@ burg , the Minister for productive recovery , had already announced it , on Monday 21 October .
After giving up the project for the purchase of the plant in January , you are now returning .
You have made violent attacks and insul@@ ts , talking about so-called &apos; so-called workers &apos; , who &apos; work three hours &apos; a day , &apos; mad &apos; trade unions , by targeting the C@@ G@@ T .
We do not understand this U@@ -@@ turn .
Is Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg happy ?
I am not trying to please anyone .
Ex@@ cep@@ t to my wife .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid .
If I have injured someone by my words , I am sorry .
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well .
Does the truth tell us that the truth is that you are not right ?
Working to work seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours ha@@ mp@@ ers France .
In India , China and the whole of other countries , we work ten to 12 hours a day .
But I do not have any prejudices about France .
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural ty@@ res , has good equipment , is well situated and has space to expand .
Why is Ti@@ tan so badly needed ?
Ti@@ tan does not need to buy this factory .
But , with proper prices and competent workers , it is worth trying .
What kind of agreement do you expect between the G@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ e@@ ar ?
If , since the announcement of the closure of the plant , Go@@ od@@ e@@ ar had offered employees a good start , I think that 100 % of employees would have accepted it .
Now , let us imagine that Ti@@ tan is buying the closed factory at Go@@ o@@ d@@ az@@ ar .
So Ti@@ tan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency .
I think that Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg knows that .
He wants to keep the A@@ mine factory with at least 3@@ 33 well-@@ paid jobs .
Ti@@ tan agrees to recru@@ it them among the roughly 1 200 current employees of Go@@ od@@ e@@ ar .
So Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg needs a commitment from Ti@@ tan before trying to get the G@@ G@@ T to sit at the table with Go@@ od@@ e@@ ar .
The first step is that the G@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ i@@ e@@ ar should draw up an agreement on starting payments for all employees .
Therefore , there will be no more employees in the factory .
Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg said that you are prepared to guarantee these 3@@ 33 jobs for four years .
Do you confirm that ?
The only number I have mentioned to the Minister is 3@@ 33 .
I know he would like a four@@ -year guarantee .
But , as I said to you , the G@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ i@@ e@@ ar must first agree on starting expenses .
If all employees accept them , the project &apos;s purchase project starts with zero employed .
How can we give guarantees of employment when there are no more employees on the site ?
If Mr Mon@@ te@@ burg succe@@ eds in ensuring that the G@@ G@@ T and Go@@ od@@ se@@ ar agree , and that Ti@@ tan is buying the factory , we intend to remain in A@@ mi@@ sia over four years .
The benefit of the falling B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , while the deli@@ veries and orders of aeroplan@@ es are shrin@@ king .
The Canadian aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical and rail manufacturer , B@@ om@@ b@@ ill@@ er In@@ c , reported a 15 % drop in its net profits on Thursday , under pressure from a drop in orders and aircraft deli@@ veries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trans@@ -European division .
Nor did B@@ om@@ b@@ ill@@ er , based in Mon@@ tre@@ al , provided flight test data for his new C@@ SO@@ S aircraft and information to know whether the plane will meet its ambitious trade agenda by September next year .
Following the inaug@@ ural flight of the testing plane around a month and a half ago , the latter has stolen only three times , and the question then arises as to whether the trial phase was on the right track .
The results were not up to expectations , and stock prices fell by 8 % to the Tor@@ onto Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change .
Cameron , analy@@ sts at the National Bank Financial Bank , low@@ ered his ratings on Thursday , ranging from “ over-@@ performance ” to “ sector performance ” because of the low potential for the stock market to rise in the next quarter or two quarters .
&apos;@@ Although the decline in aircraft deli@@ veries has been largely anticipated , we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division &apos; , which has declared Cameron Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a bill to the customers .
We believe that B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er will register new orders for his C@@ Ser@@ ies planes as the flight test programme advances .
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .
B@@ om@@ b@@ ying hopes that the family of C@@ Ser@@ ies aircraft will cat@@ er to the lower seg@@ ment of a market now dominated by Bo@@ eing and Airbus .
The first test plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in March and first bur@@ ned in September after months of delay .
But the number of firm orders for C@@ Ser@@ ies is modest so far as 17@@ 7 ; it seems that potential bu@@ yers are waiting for flight tests to valid@@ ate company claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential of the new online aircraft .
At present , society has had a total of 40@@ 3 orders and purchasing commitments from 15 customers and operators .
Pi@@ er@@ re Be@@ au@@ ow@@ in , President and head of the leadership , is convinced that B@@ om@@ b@@ ill@@ er will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is commercial .
Lead@@ ers also reassured the analy@@ sts and the media on Thursday that the programme was advancing according to the timetable .
&apos;@@ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than expected &apos; , said Mr Be@@ au@@ ow@@ n at a telephone conference , adding that ground tests and software updating were planned during the flight time period .
Each manufacturer is planning in a different way .
We had decided to make a first flight and to have a period of updating , and that is what we have done .
This will happen throughout the flight programme .
The second of the five test aircraft should be flying in the next few weeks , the others will follow shortly afterwards , indicated society .
Yet analy@@ sts are sceptical that the first customer can fly a C@@ Ser@@ ies plane only 12 months after its inaug@@ ural flight .
B@@ om@@ bling has indicated that she is assessing the timetable for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months .
“ This slu@@ gg@@ ish@@ ness in flight trials – though apparently in line with B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal calendar – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015 , ” Mr Do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said .
In the third quarter , on 30 September , the net benefit of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er fell to $ 14@@ 7 , or 8 c@@ ents per action , compared to $ 17@@ 2 , or 9 c@@ ents per year .
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 c@@ ents .
incomes have fallen slightly from 4.@@ 2 to 4.@@ 1 M@@ d .
analy@@ sts expected a 10 c@@ ents in action and income of 4.@@ 56 M@@ d , according to Thomas Re@@ u@@ ters I / B / S@@ .
The world &apos;s fourth aircraft manufacturer indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter , compared to 57 a year earlier .
The net orders fell to 26 planes , compared to 83 before .
The delay in the A@@ é@@ on@@ au@@ tical division was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 trillion on 30 September , which is unchanged compared to 31 December of the previous year .
&apos;@@ In A@@ é@@ on@@ au@@ tics , the results were in line with our forecasts , but the low number of orders and general conditions in the market was disappointing &apos; .
A@@ é@@ on@@ au@@ tics ’ s income has fallen by 13 % to $ 2 trillion .
B@@ om@@ b@@ ying , the largest railway manufacturer in the world , said that the income from that division had increased by nearly 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 trillion .
The orders for the transport division total $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 trillion on 30 September , a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year .
The margins for the transport division have suffered from the implementation problems concerning some major contracts .
The leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter .
The B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er shares , which also announced that Pat@@ rick Pi@@ ch@@ et@@ te , head of Google ’ s financial management , would sit on the board , fell from 8@@ .5 % to $ 4.@@ 83 in the afternoon of Thursday .
Brazilian company Em@@ br@@ er SA , the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world and the ne@@ arest competi@@ tor of B@@ om@@ bar@@ di@@ er , indicated on Thursday a 10 % drop in its quar@@ terly benefit .
Two sp@@ inning sp@@ ans of 23 and 27 years ago were missing in an ab@@ ys@@ s under the W@@ t of C@@ ill@@ es since Thursday evening , and were taught on Friday to the S@@ p@@ el@@ ed@@ o rescue of the Is@@ le .
They have been loc@@ alised this ven@@ d@@ or afternoon .
The two men , a ligh@@ tw@@ eight in practice , and the other no , went underground on Thursday at 9.@@ 30 a.m. in order to pass through the W@@ t de Cro@@ ill@@ er on the St Pi@@ er@@ re de Char@@ tr@@ ous .
They were then un@@ news since then .
&apos;@@ S@@ p@@ el@@ e@@ olog@@ ists should have appeared at around 5@@ h in the morning &apos; , said Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry L@@ ar@@ be , a technical advis@@ er to the S@@ p@@ el@@ ed@@ o relief organisation .
Do@@ z@@ ens of people there on the ground
Some 20 sec@@ ur@@ ists , ten civilians in the S@@ p@@ el@@ e@@ o French rescue , and police police , C@@ R@@ S , and fire@@ fighters were there .
At the end of the afternoon , the two s@@ pend@@ ome@@ olog@@ ists were loc@@ alised .
&apos;@@ It is another group of s@@ asp@@ ome@@ olog@@ ists which , after having found their way out but in good health in the ca@@ ke , sent information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network &apos; explains the D@@ au@@ ph@@ en .
The two soldiers at the 13@@ th bat@@ tal@@ ion of Cha@@ m@@ ber@@ ry Cha@@ m@@ bers were found &apos; exhausted but not injured &apos; .
They have lost out in the network , returned to their homes while waiting for relief .
They should emerge from the ca@@ ke with the help of the sec@@ ur@@ ists in the evening .
German journalists invited to flee Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o
The union of German journalists invited its members on Thursday to stop using the online services of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o following new re@@ vel@@ ations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services .
&apos;@@ The German Federation of Jour@@ n@@ alists recommends that journalists avoid the use of research engines and Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mess@@ aging engines until recently &apos; .
She considers the Washington Po@@ st information to be outrageous , according to which the UK National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) and the British Govern@@ ance He@@ ad@@ quarters ( G@@ C@@ H@@ Q ) collected m@@ asses of information by inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating international networks that allow both firms to syn@@ chron@@ ize their ser@@ vers .
&apos;@@ The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the co-@@ ordin@@ ation of their sources and the nature of their communications with them &apos; , and has added Mic@@ hael K@@ on@@ k@@ en , President of the trade union , to 3@@ 8@@ ,000 .
Welcome : a Member calls for the resignation of Bri@@ g@@ te Grou@@ win .
The plan by Minister Bri@@ g@@ te Grou@@ w@@ els of &apos; R@@ ef@@ lec@@ tion &apos; of the po@@ les of traffic lights in Brussels does not like everyone .
As a reminder , this Thursday , the Brussels Minister for Public Affairs and Transport , in the centre of Brussels , launched a test project to pain@@ t 16 po@@ les of light lights in the y@@ el@@ low and blue col@@ ours from Brussels .
The aim is both &apos; to increase security &apos; and &apos; Brussels identity &apos; .
The idea is , in the long term , to review all the Brussels signs , at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million .
However , the blue chosen by the Minister is &apos; too thin &apos; , according to the Brussels MEP Em@@ manu@@ el De Bo@@ ck , who talks about the capital &apos; roc@@ ket &apos; and calls for the &apos; resignation &apos; of Bri@@ g@@ te Grou@@ win .
&apos;@@ Not content to spend money on Brussels &apos; money in f@@ laun@@ ting po@@ les of sign@@ alling po@@ les at the Brussels Region , Bri@@ g@@ te Grou@@ g@@ els continues its Capital of Capital operations , res@@ isting Mr De Bo@@ ck in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
After his tax@@ is tax@@ is , she has finally re@@ pain@@ ted himself as a black blue j@@ ank in Brussels .
According to the honourable Member , there is now no longer any difference in visual continuity between F@@ landers and Brussels .
Brussels deserve better than seeing their money squ@@ an@@ dered by a C@@ D &amp; V Minister , who itself perform the N@@ V@@ A programme .
It is high time we stopped the Tro@@ j@@ an horse from F@@ landers .
&apos;@@ To recall , Bri@@ g@@ te Grou@@ win was elected only with 2 2@@ 45 votes to 0.5 % of Brussels ! &apos; , concludes Mr De Bo@@ ck .

P@@ on@@ t-@@ de@@ -B@@ u@@ is &apos;s eco-@@ tax pig , around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place Saturday , was disman@@ tled on Thursday morning .
There were cr@@ acks on the spot shortly after 10 hours , and the movement on the national side was hi@@ j@@ acked .
The decision on decommissioning , announced by the pre@@ fec@@ ture of the Fin@@ is@@ er on Wednesday , was taken by E@@ compar@@ ov , pig manag@@ er .
This is the last of the three eco@@ tax pigs operating in the department of the Fin@@ is@@ er , the other two having been disman@@ tled or sab@@ ot@@ aged .
L@@ it@@ tle of a bot@@ tle for Google G@@ l@@ ass
An online shop , proposing multiple by-@@ products for Google G@@ l@@ ass , has just been made available to the thousands of develop@@ ers with a proto@@ type of the inter@@ connected gl@@ asses signed Google .
In this way , they can acquire a head@@ phones , a char@@ ger , or even a f@@ us@@ s .
This shop , which is strictly reserved for develop@@ ers already having Google G@@ l@@ ass , suggests a few by-@@ products such as a char@@ ger and his US@@ B c@@ able for $ 50 .
For the same price , it is also possible to acquire a shelter that is manufactured in micro@@ fi@@ bre or an in@@ tra@@ -European head@@ line .
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google G@@ l@@ ass with ver@@ bal ver@@ res , no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed .
It is already five years since my father got away from the world of living life .
At the beginning I denied his death , I was talking about him .
I was so afraid to forget it or , rather , I did not know how I was going to continue with it .
There is no recipe , no way of working to pass the wall of the in@@ visible and to find its si@@ ghts .
Then there were signs of this .
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat when I was driving .
Once again , a swe@@ et aw@@ ak@@ ening in the middle of night to look at the evidence that no longer leaves me , put on the night table .
It is the image of my s@@ mil@@ ing father who accompany me in my gest@@ ures on a daily basis .
Our mother left us after his exhausted fight against cancer .
That is at least what I thought of the day when I found his body empty , cr@@ ying down on this hospital bed to che@@ ated flags .
Likewise , his fun@@ eral was a gl@@ aci@@ al f@@ are@@ well focused around the meag@@ re ch@@ or@@ us of the h@@ ann@@ ers .
I thought it was part of that .
L@@ it@@ tle by little , by small or night appearances , a little ti@@ mid , a little er@@ ased , it quickly returned to my mind , moving as it took its place in my thought that believed in m@@ our@@ ning .
And then it turned out , while dis@@ covering my own fac@@ ets that I had not yet seen , conce@@ aled by my relationship with it .
So I learned and understand that I had not lost the person of my mother but simply a woman whom I did not really know , a woman who embo@@ died this person during his stay in life .
By dying , this woman had perfect life and released the person I love , and now I found it , full and full .
This devi@@ ation from my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful .
It is a privilege to know that loved people do not leave us .
I like my father , &apos; both in and outside &apos; .
I have always been told that .
I never believed that at the time .
I had difficult relations with him until he became old , sick .
There I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him .
One day , he is dead .
For a long time he accompanied me : when I stopped smoking , when I was afraid , when I was wrong ...
He spoke to me and always encouraged me , he was my body .
I saw his hands in looking at mine , I was lending him my body .
But it was never in@@ discre@@ et .
I have been able to have a personal life .
It left me with my in@@ tim@@ acy .
It has lasted for a long time .
Finally , it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood , encouraged and advised .
I no longer know who said that people who died are not forgotten , but are in@@ visible .
My parents are no longer , but I always see them .
Every event , every moment of my life makes me feel here , because I always refer to it : what would they have said , what would they have thought , and what would they have done ?
I always dream of them , perhaps not all the ni@@ ghts but several times a week .
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late , but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing this .
I often wake up when it comes to me and I feel deeply about their absence .
Sometimes there are dreams , on the contrary , which are part of my history , and indeed they continue to live and share my life .
On the day when I had to know the sex of my baby , I dre@@ am@@ t that I wake up , I wal@@ ked away from the bed , my father was waiting for me and s@@ mil@@ ing and rejo@@ ic@@ ing that I expect a little bo@@ y .
The next day , I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sle@@ ep to tell me that he was happy to share what came to me .
And of course it was a small bo@@ y in my home .
I wanted to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell you that common memory lived after his death .
Five years ago , my grand@@ mother died as a result of cancer .
A year ago she was travelling with my family in Cuba .
That is the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bas@@ ket I was at the time .
Nevertheless , I have realised my m@@ our@@ ning fairly quickly .
But it continues to influence my life , particularly at times when I find myself in difficulties , or when I have to make important decisions .
To take the Arab side and interest me in the Middle East , to the point of turning it into a m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece in a great school , has not , in retro@@ spec@@ t , been an@@ onymous choices .
In fact , I often heard him speak Arab in my childhood , and talking about Morocco , where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence .
The values she has accused of me are always present , so I think I think how she would like me to act at some point .
The same applies to my attitudes : I am trying to live up to the generosity and the spirit of spirit of the one that was a fer@@ vent fer@@ ry .
Now I feel it is a daily presence , a ben@@ evol@@ ent soul , a sal@@ v@@ tor spirit .
I see his eyes to me .
My mother died 19 years ago now .
Mor@@ te after I spoke to the telephone .
I have gone through all the stages : the lack of understanding , anger , pain , the gri@@ ev@@ ances that are unle@@ ashed alone , anywhere , wherever , in un@@ told places , in@@ con@@ gr@@ uous moments .
Then the time has come to ease the death penalty .
The lack of an answer , a vacuum without response , and the need for it to entr@@ ust me with reas@@ surance at the s@@ word of its sof@@ tness .
But she is there , there is a silent presence , she is there and watching me .
Every morning , I see his concern about me , I see the gu@@ ys who are increasing his eyes , the ri@@ ps around the li@@ ps that cigarettes , the con@@ s that raise the front day on the front pages .
My mother has taken on my face and she is watching me every morning in my mir@@ ror .
And every morning , I turn a blind eye .
My wife and mother of my three children died from cancer to 43 years .
There is always a sense of protection , and nothing serious can happen .
It was his promise on his be@@ ac@@ on of pain , so it was gradually re@@ discovered to s@@ mile , and his name is no longer taboo but a comfort .
Of course , I am talking to him in the night of night when the absence of too bad a absence , she inv@@ ites in my dreams when the mor@@ ale is a little achieved .
We feel that we are being moved and protected in difficult times , and the time has come for us to realise how much it is or@@ che@@ str@@ a , and we are trying to stay on the path that it had outlined to us .
If one is very much like you , the absence of the absence of the absence of the heart and memories cannot be achieved .
In a way , the loved one is becoming your domestic energy .
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer .
I was very close to him , I have always acted according to what he thought or what he appreciated .
I was unable to attend his in@@ hum@@ ation and three weeks after his death , I gave birth to a small bo@@ y .
If I have sometimes different convictions from him , I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision .
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions .
For me , it is impossible to go in the opposite direction , I do not sh@@ y away from it and I always wonder what it will think about .
I do not know whether I have adopted his way of being or whether I am just like him : is it genetic ?
In any case , it will always be my reference .
It was a bit like a back@@ lo@@ g , there was no need to talk amongst ourselves .
In short , he is here on a daily basis .
I feel that I am here and that makes me happy .
It is almost 30 years since my hus@@ band died at the age of 33 .
I was 28 years old and our son 6 years .
The huge sentence that inv@@ aded me then has of course diminished , but it is still close to me .
Very often he &apos; lan@@ ded &apos; in my dreams in such a precise way , so vi@@ vi@@ dly , that I am even more sad to see that this was just a dream .
The other night , he asked me if I was going , I said no , he replied &apos; I des@@ c@@ end &apos; , but with such a real voice that I wo@@ ke up and wo@@ ken up and turned the horse into the horse and watching everywhere .
I still live in the same house , and often I feel watching and look to see if he is not there , I know that it is he and I am talking to him .
In all the coins I feel that I am here and that makes me happy .
For nothing in the world I would leave that house where we were happy and the spirit lives with me .
I am 58 years old , I have always lived only since his departure , he is and will remain a love of my life .
I would like to make it clear that I am social with a profession of responsibility , and I am standing up and pra@@ ying , I am a grand@@ mother , I am full of friends , but my heart and soul belong to him and I never speak of him except my son , and I never go to the c@@ eme@@ tery .
Iraq
October , in Iraq , was the most deadly month since April 2008 .
Baghdad published official figures this Friday : 9@@ 64 people lost their lives last month : 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers .
This is the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants help from the United States .
&apos;@@ We do not say the world to be on our side and support us , we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it &apos; , declared Al@@ M@@ ali@@ ki this Thursday in Washington .
And also because , if what is happening in Iraq is not settled , it will expand , and what is happening in Syria will also spread .
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives and is spreading .
N@@ our@@ y al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace , an independent institution created by Congress .
O@@ ut@@ side the building , demonstrators prote@@ sted against the Iraqi leader .
They were running plac@@ ards accused , among other things , of being a murde@@ rer and calling on the US to refuse to provide aid .
The co@@ c@@ ain@@ e lawyer who informed a drug spons@@ or of a police investigation was imprisoned in prison .
Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed in the light of day .
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by the Li@@ ver@@ pool Court of Li@@ ver@@ pool .
A great defence lawyer , who informed a drug spons@@ or of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was not revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
Bas@@ har@@ at Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , gave sensitive information to the crime l@@ ord N@@ ei@@ l S@@ car@@ rou@@ gh about investigations into his activities in connection with drug trafficking after having been compromised because of his habit of eating co@@ c@@ ain@@ e .
The lawyer , who was known as &apos; Bas@@ h &apos; and regarded by criminals as a &apos; matter of prime importance &apos; , was arrested at home in 2011 following police listen to S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , which he represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking .
The police officials have re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed Sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 years ago , and are tabling three co@@ c@@ ain@@ e bag@@ s at the home of the lawyer in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , when he attended a Bar@@ re@@ au din@@ ner with colleagues .
Sur@@ ve@@ ys revealed that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of this cl@@ ass@@ -@@ class drug after tests showed co@@ c@@ ain@@ e trac@@ es in his ha@@ ir , portfolio , and credit cards .
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he sought illegally to obtain information on the arrest of two men for S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough and one of his associ@@ ates .
The four suspects were monitored by the police at the time in a major investigation into a hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e trafficking in the coun@@ ties of Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re , C@@ um@@ bri@@ a , Mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , Ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and W@@ est Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
Together with 32 other men , they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized hero@@ in and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e for an amount of £ 1.5 m , and more than £ 200 000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
Di@@ t@@ ta , 42 years , provided information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed .
Today , in Li@@ ver@@ pool , Di@@ t@@ ta , who works in the cabinet of For@@ bes Solidarity in Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , has fallen into dis@@ repu@@ te after he was convicted on two charges of charges against justice after a three-@@ week trial .
He had admitted the possession of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e in a previous hearing .
The fall of the lawyer came after the police , investigating S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta in February 2011 .
Two investig@@ ators followed the suspect and returned him to the home of Di@@ t@@ ta , placing drugs , pure to 60 % , under the b@@ ann@@ er of the lawyer in a black gol@@ f g@@ ant .
S@@ hor@@ tly after the deposit , S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough was regularly in telephone contact with Di@@ t@@ ta , a din@@ ner at E@@ wood Par@@ k ’ s so@@ cc@@ er stad@@ ium , the forum of the Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n Ro@@ p club .
The lawyer has returned home , discovered drugs , and they have tele@@ ph@@ oned nine times .
The court heard that Di@@ t@@ ta was a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after tests showed trac@@ es of the A A drug in his ha@@ ir , his portfolio and his credit cards .
Di@@ t@@ ta was arrested later , but denied co@@ c@@ ain@@ e , he said that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficking because it was his cli@@ ent and argued that their discussions were subject to a &apos; legal privilege &apos; .
During his arrest , Di@@ t@@ ta collected his portfolio and tried to withdraw a number of credit cards , but they were all seized and they were taken away from ha@@ ir s@@ ample .
In an inter@@ rog@@ ation , he said that he had an office at home , as well as at his place of work , and that he arrived at his home in legal matters .
But the court heard evidence that he called major players in the drugs trade , some of whom he had represented , after key arrests to tell them which investig@@ ators knew .
The prosecutor An@@ ne W@@ hy@@ te said : &apos; If someone is to know that the law should not be violated , it is a criminal lawyer . &apos;
Mr Di@@ ut@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal lawyer and of having been too involved with individual customers .
The relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug drug , but a drug drug drug drug to its own lawyer .
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer .
But it went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his cli@@ ent .
It has hindered the police investigation as much as it has been able to allow it to continue its criminal activities .
Mr Di@@ t@@ ta did not honour his profession , but has dis@@ honoured him .
He has come too close to some customers , especially S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , and has allowed his independence to be compromised .
Di@@ ut@@ ta denied all illegal interference and said : &apos; If I were a corrupt lawyer , what I am not , and if I wanted to provide information to Mr S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough , I would not have waited 3 p.m. , I would have done it immediately . &apos;
But after the hearing , the super@@ er Le@@ e Hal@@ ste@@ ad of the Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re Policy said : &apos; Mr Di@@ t@@ ta has gone from a criminal criminal lawyer himself as he started to get drugs from criminal organisations &apos; .
His addiction to co@@ c@@ ain@@ e has been compromised forever and made it vulnerable to the back@@ thought of leaders of organised criminal groups who have charged him with valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers should observe the stric@@ test rules of integrity and create a climate of public confidence .
Mr Di@@ ut@@ ta betra@@ yed that confidence and tried to hide behind his profession .
Lanc@@ as@@ hi@@ re &apos;s serious and organised crime crime unit conducted the investigation into Mr Di@@ ut@@ ta , who has been convicted of the three charges for the possession of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and now of the judicial barrier , demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminals .
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals to know that nobody is above the law .
We will find you and you will be brought before the courts .
S@@ car@@ bor@@ ough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after claiming guilty of complicity in hero@@ in , co@@ c@@ ain@@ e and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is trafficking .
Thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in trafficking have been sentenced to a total of 15@@ 3 years in prison for drug trafficking .
On his site , Di@@ t@@ ta organised a Question Time / answers on himself , during which he said that his dream jo@@ ke would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his latest gu@@ est to din@@ ner would be Mo@@ ham@@ med Ali , and inequality would be what motiv@@ ates him to work .
A@@ re@@ than@@ a Frank@@ lin will go back on the scene in December in December in December .

L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es airport evac@@ uated after a sho@@ oting sho@@ oting
A sho@@ oting took place at L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es international airport .
It was 10.@@ 00 a.m. when a man opened fire .
According to local police , there are at least 2 injured .
It would be an employee working for the United States Administration for Transport Security ( T@@ SA ) and the perpetr@@ ator of fire .
The incident would have occurred in ter@@ minal 3 , causing panic .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers and staff have been rush@@ ed to the exit or to the l@@ ump .
Very quickly police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the draw@@ er was caught on the ro@@ of of an airport par@@ k .

Each time , the school cli@@ ent will be targeted , an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season .
Through five s@@ ay@@ n@@ ets dre@@ am@@ ed up and interpreted by artists in the region , stic@@ kers with a great do@@ se of hum@@ our are allowing teen@@ ag@@ ers to vote for classi@@ cal s@@ wa@@ thes .
In addition to this spectac@@ le , the Kingdom ’ s ly@@ ric@@ al art company will return with its ly@@ ric@@ al D@@ es@@ ti@@ des , a formula that is now filled with the P@@ ul@@ per@@ y of Chi@@ ric@@ um@@ i .
Two other consultations will take place in summer 2014 , giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of .
These activities were added to the ly@@ ric@@ al Ap@@ er , the concer@@ t of profit held last August , with the help of the col@@ lo@@ ano col@@ or@@ atory Mari@@ e-@@ E@@ ve M@@ un@@ ger .
It was a profit , alongside the artistic dimension , and it helped the profit@@ -making body to produce a financial balance sheet which is as swe@@ et in ears as an air in the m@@ ouse .
Without giving precise figures , the chairman of the board , Y@@ ves Ber@@ ger@@ on , took advantage of yesterday &apos;s press meeting in Ch@@ ric@@ ti@@ m@@ i to be reassuring .
Despite the insecurity of so many cultural institutions , the future is well , even in the long term .

&apos;@@ The finances are af@@ lo@@ at and we hope to continue until the 50@@ th anniversary of the oper@@ as , a step that we will take in seven years &apos; .

New demand for collective redress against the Sain@@ t C@@ r@@ r@@ é bro@@ thers
A new request for collective redress has been lod@@ ged against the Sain@@ t C@@ r@@ r@@ é bro@@ thers , on sexual assa@@ ults this time in the St Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ deal and in several orph@@ an@@ ages , col@@ leg@@ es and schools .
The request is based on the peti@@ tion@@ er &apos;s testi@@ mony , identified as &apos; J@@ . J@@ . J &apos; , which would have been m@@ our@@ ned in the 1950 &apos;s , first in E@@ sp@@ i@@ e-@@ des@@ -@@ Ne@@ g@@ ges by her prof@@ essor , the Sou@@ dr@@ é bro@@ ther , then by his holder , Fa@@ ther Ber@@ n@@ ard , at the Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ b , where he was serving a mass and his father worked as pain@@ t .
The first appeal was only three institutions , and when the Rules of Procedure were announced , many people said to us : &apos; I was in such a place , I am able to register &apos; , told the lawyer Ala@@ in Ar@@ sen@@ ult , who defends the victims in both cases .
The collective redress that has just been tabled has the special characteristics of allowing complain@@ ants from any institution where abuses could have been carried out by members of the cons@@ ol@@ ation of Sain@@ t C@@ r@@ r@@ é .
At present , the complaint brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Sain@@ t Cross bro@@ thers .
The alleged facts are generally older than those referred to in the first appeal , since several of the establishments targeted closed in the 196@@ 0s .
The appeal also underlines that the cons@@ ol@@ ation of Sain@@ t C@@ r@@ r@@ é and the Sain@@ t Jose@@ p@@ h or@@ deal , which is a separate entity , &apos; allowed sexual abuse of children &apos; , that they &apos; have exercised a moral , religious and psychological constra@@ int on the victims &apos; , that they &apos; knew about the sexual abuse of the victims and have nevertheless stif@@ led them &apos; .
These latest accusations are based , among other things , on letters drawn up by the lawyer of the Sain@@ t C@@ r@@ r@@ é bro@@ thers , M@@ e E@@ mile Per@@ ri@@ n , in the 1990s , but also by the research carried out in the archi@@ ves on this subject by the bro@@ ther Wil@@ son Ken@@ ne@@ dy , a former bro@@ ther of Sain@@ t Cross who publicly denounced the abuses .
Col@@ lec@@ tive redress must first of all take the stage of ad@@ mis@@ sibility into the higher court .
Once the Court ad@@ mits ad@@ mis@@ sibility , the second stage is the hearings on the substance .
In the case of the first appeal , the cons@@ ol@@ ation of Sain@@ t C@@ r@@ r@@ é had agreed to settle am@@ ic@@ ably before hearings are carried out .
Fir@@ e fire in trade in trade in trade in trade
A fire caused serious damage to a trade in the ar@@ r@@ al of La@@ Sal@@ le in Mon@@ tre@@ al on Thursday night at Friday .
The aid was called on to 1@@ h , Friday , because of a fire that had declared itself in the sub@@ soil of an Indian k@@ it@@ ch@@ en restaur@@ ant on the D@@ ol@@ ard route , near the inter@@ section with the R@@ an@@ j@@ e street .
The 30 fire@@ fighters who have been sent to the site have taken almost an hour to control the po@@ le@@ m@@ ic .
The fire has &apos; caused serious damage to the structure of the building &apos; , indicated the head of the Mon@@ tre@@ al fire security service , Richard Bor@@ de@@ au@@ x .
The cause of the fire was unknown , but there was no one in restaur@@ ant when the fire fighters arrived .
There have been no injuries , but almost 20 housing , located at the first and second floor of this str@@ and of commercial premises , had to be evac@@ uated .
The Red Cross was requested , because residents of one of the flat@@ s could have to be temporarily off , indicated the S@@ M .
Many opposition to medical aid to die in the Congress of pal@@ lia@@ tive care
The Canadian pal@@ lia@@ tive care Congress , which is taking place this week in Ot@@ ta@@ wa , comes a few days after the vote in favour of the draft law on medical aid to die in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
This is an opportunity for several pal@@ lia@@ tive care associations to reaffirm their disagreement .
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering , as well as being able to stay at home , very few would like to end their days , according to a spokesman from the Canadian pal@@ lia@@ tive care Association , Mar@@ y@@ se B@@ ut@@ te .
If the emphasis was placed on pal@@ lia@@ tive care in Canada , the eu@@ than@@ a@@ sia approach would become minimal .
The president of the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c pal@@ lia@@ tive care Network also rejects the draft law on medical aid to die .
If it is adopted , Al@@ ber@@ te D@@ é@@ ry is concerned about the consequences for future generations .
&apos;@@ What is the meaning of life &apos; , is it regrettable ?
The majority of pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses will refuse to help patients die , according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of pal@@ lia@@ tive care houses , Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e F@@ it@@ z@@ back .
Mrs F@@ it@@ z@@ back , who is the head of the Ma@@ thi@@ u@@ -@@ Franc@@ om@@ e S@@ av@@ se house in G@@ at@@ te@@ au , believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway .
We never ask ourselves : &apos; I want to die , give me an injec@@ tion &apos; .
The Director of the A@@ tari@@ o pal@@ lia@@ tive care Association , R@@ ick F@@ ir@@ th , believes that the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c bill is dis@@ orien@@ t@@ ating the population about the vocation of pal@@ lia@@ tive care .
He does not believe that the On@@ tari@@ o will follow suit .
For its part , the liberal Member of G@@ at@@ ille , St@@ é@@ ph@@ ania V@@ all@@ és , says that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft law is adopted .
The Ken@@ yan press is indign@@ ant about the controversial media law
&apos;@@ It is a frigh@@ tening country and it is legitimate to ask the following question : what will prevent Parliament from wi@@ ping out the independence of the justice system tomorrow ? &apos; , said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and calling for it to be declared un@@ constitutional .
“ This law is d@@ rac@@ onian and very p@@ uni@@ tive , and we reject it , ” explained P@@ yr@@ us K@@ am@@ au , Director General of Capital Group – the owner of C@@ he@@ tal@@ F@@ M , one of the most respected independent news stations and websites in Kenya .
He said that the new media court &apos; will always be biased because it is an extension of the government &apos; and the restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&apos;@@ I hope that the President will listen to us , and we ask him to reject this draft law and refer it back to the Members &apos; .
According to the Sta@@ r newspaper , the new bill will allow the government to have “ media control ” ; the Stand@@ ard has indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “ had suffered a hard blow ” and called the bill “ d@@ rac@@ onian . ”
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the West@@ g@@ ate trade centre last September .
The Ken@@ yan media gave rise to anger by the authorities by dissem@@ inating images of video cam@@ er@@ as on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack supposedly de@@ pressed the luxury commercial centre .
The police chief , David K@@ im@@ ai@@ yo , responded by conven@@ ing two journalists and a media officer to ask them , even though the conven@@ ing was withdrawn after a media shield was lifted .
Under the new bill , the media can be pun@@ ishable by fines of up to 20 million Ken@@ yan sh@@ ill@@ ings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being &apos; radi@@ ated &apos; or of receiving official acc@@ red@@ itation .
The court also has the power to seize the assets of a offen@@ der if he did not pay his fine .
According to D@@ ai@@ ly N@@ ation , “ even one fine is enough to paraly@@ se most F@@ M stations . ”
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya ’ s “ anim@@ ated blo@@ go@@ sphere . ”
By cutting the media in silence , politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity .
“ No one will ever know , ” wrote Mu@@ tu@@ ma Ma@@ thi@@ u , a journalist in The N@@ ation , describing the Ken@@ yan media as a key source of control in public life .
“ Li@@ v@@ med to themselves , politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and to the cu@@ t-@@ off . ”
Ken@@ yan legislators have been the target of popular anger in the past .
In May , they took a stand against the cuts made by the National Commission for salaries and restored their m@@ ol@@ li@@ fying salaries of around 5@@ 32 000 sh@@ ill@@ ings per month of tax exemption – which are among the highest in the world .
A difficult New Year for pharmac@@ ists
L@@ av@@ al ’ s departure from nearly 10 pharmac@@ ists to the Social Health and Social Services Centre in L@@ av@@ al caused a great deal to be done in the direction of the Ci@@ te@@ -@@ Health Ho@@ p@@ ital in 201@@ 2-@@ 2013 .
As a result of multiple retirement , maternity leave , or very short leave , the P@@ harm@@ ac@@ ist department has found itself in a very poor position in staff .
There was almost 30 % of the staff needed , making this financial year &apos; very difficult &apos; , according to the department of the department , G@@ illi@@ an Be@@ au@@ d@@ let .
However , the S@@ S has decided not to employ an independent workforce , which can cost up to three times as much as a full-@@ time pharmac@@ ist .
There was no use of the breakdown , explained Mrs Be@@ au@@ de@@ let .
Some of our activities have been stream@@ lined or reduced within the framework of the establishment , the time that is going on .
It is clear that we have worked hard to interest our young people in pharm@@ acies to come and stay here .
There is a contest of circumstances which has meant that we were in a bad situation last year .
Im@@ proving improved Situation Situation improved improved
After this difficult period , 201@@ 3-@@ 2014 will be much easier for the S@@ S S@@ S Department .
Already , three pharmac@@ ists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmac@@ ists have been hi@@ j@@ acked over the last few months .
In addition , the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit , because the four pupils now under house arrest in L@@ av@@ al have also decided to remain on the CS@@ S@@ S .
Now it is much better , has highlighted the pharmac@@ ist .
By the end of the financial year , we will have seven new pharmac@@ ists and three maternity returns .
This will therefore close our departure from last year .
L@@ ess ever ever rising , L@@ ess ever more , ever growing
However , the situation remains delicate .
Several factors , such as the shortage of hospital pharmac@@ ists or the predomin@@ ance of young women in the profession , make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult .
For us &#91; the number of staff &#93; is always precarious , because we have a young environment and many young women are employed , so with pregnan@@ cies , you almost always drive three maternity leave when it is good , it added .
The last year we have had much more and there are no pharmac@@ ists who are available to make replacement , so it was more difficult .
The 22 years do not start his career in cinema by the back door .

This porno@@ graphic drama is ramp@@ ant , in eight chapters that will emerge in two parts ( on 1 and 8 January 2014 ) , the ero@@ ding memories of a qu@@ ad@@ ra@@ gen@@ an increase gender since its ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence .
The resemb@@ l@@ ance of Sta@@ y Martin with his old age is striking : a sh@@ ut@@ tle of sh@@ ell@@ s , a di@@ ph@@ ane tal@@ e and Franco-@@ English origins .
Not forgetting a certain taste of the risk : the one who had not hesit@@ ated to lay bl@@ unt on ice paper is going to be manife@@ sted in much more sophisticated situations on a large scre@@ en .
An extr@@ act from N@@ y@@ mp@@ hom@@ ania raised the temperature on the We@@ b : Sta@@ y Martin appears to be on the ver@@ ge and in full ex@@ t@@ achment with Shi@@ a La@@ Be@@ ou@@ f .
If the fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker has asked its actors to put their pun@@ ches on the shel@@ f , he used X professionals for the most o@@ ked sex scenes , before mer@@ ging all the bodies num@@ er@@ ically : above the bel@@ t , it is star .
From B@@ j@@ ör@@ k to Char@@ lot@@ te G@@ ain@@ s@@ burg , to Nic@@ o@@ le K@@ id@@ man , L@@ ars von T@@ ri@@ er is accustomed to pushing his supporters into their last , always for the better .
Sta@@ y Martin has not finished talking about it .
A N@@ ar@@ lo@@ -@@ evac@@ e@@ ated C@@ G@@ L@@ s
On Thursday evening , the first sitting of a film was interrupted at N@@ ou@@ bon C@@ G@@ R in N@@ ar@@ bon , a precautionary measure , as a result of the g@@ ate pi@@ gg@@ ers felt by the spec@@ t@@ ators .
Im@@ medi@@ ately , the director of the establishment has carried out the evac@@ uation of the room and warned the fire@@ men for a suspect sm@@ ell .
Some 70 people have emerged from the sitting .
People have been examined and full recognition of the Chamber has not given any indication .
L@@ it@@ tle jo@@ ke ?
Or an invol@@ un@@ tary incident ?
However , the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients .
The room has been postponed and everything has gone into order .
The cinema has been able to regain its rights and customers regain the pleasure of the images .
Only on scre@@ en alone .
She is trying to import 2 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e into ch@@ ro@@ ps
As a result of the H@@ all@@ we@@ an day , a woman tried to get two kil@@ os of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e hidden in ci@@ ro@@ ls , on Thursday morning , at Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ present airport .
It was during the examination of the b@@ agg@@ age of the passenger that drugs were detected .
The co@@ c@@ ain@@ e had been distributed in three ci@@ b@@ els having previously been broken .
Drugs were then transported to the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie Office of Canada ( G@@ R@@ C ) which took over in this investigation .
The Canada border service agency ( SA@@ F@@ C ) did not reveal where the woman came from when it was inter@@ cep@@ ted .
It was part of the investigation , indicated J@@ ad@@ e@@ in Rob@@ y , spokesman for the SA@@ F@@ C .
What I can tell you is that it came to the country .
Since the beginning of 2013 , border service agents at the Mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ T@@ ru@@ present airport have carried out 17@@ 3 se@@ iz@@ ures of drugs , including 10 co@@ c@@ ain@@ e se@@ iz@@ ures for a total of 44 k@@ ilo@@ grams .
In 2012 , agents of border services in the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c region carried out a total of 16@@ 53 seized drugs .
Air strikes in Syria
According to the Lebanese army , Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon , but the strikes took place this evening .
A ship@@ ment of short-@@ range air missiles SA@@ -@@ 8 would have been targeted and destroyed .
This new aviation ra@@ id on the Syrian territory ( the sixth since the beginning of the year , according to the Israeli daily newspaper Ha@@ are@@ tz ) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor by Syria .
The ra@@ id took place in almost the same circumstances on 5 July : at the time , it was also an an@@ onymous American official who confirmed in C@@ N@@ N an Israeli attack on the Y@@ ak@@ h@@ ai offshore missiles .
Israeli officials had not conce@@ aled their irrit@@ ation to see Washington reveal the attack , at the risk of forcing President Assad to react .
The Ukraine
The credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; Po@@ ce low@@ ered Ukraine &apos;s cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess on Friday , questioning the capacity of the former Soviet Republic , in recession for more than a year , to face its financial obligations .
The note of the country ’ s government debt securities goes to &apos; B@@ - &apos; , moving into the category of speculative investment .
It has a negative perspective , S &amp; amp ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ;
“ It is becoming less and less likely that government strategy will allow enough foreign currencies to meet its high external financing needs , ” explains the US agency .
The agency notes that Ukraine ’ s foreign-@@ exchange reserves fell by 26 % between September 2012 and September 2013 and that the trend will continue .
This makes it difficult to re@@ pay loans abroad .
These reserves , to which the authorities rely heavily to support the local currency , the collapse of h@@ ry@@ v@@ nia , the agency is increasingly likely to de@@ value , which would increase its external debt .
Ki@@ ev also needs liquidity to settle gas imports to Russia , which accuse him of not having paid a bill of $ 8@@ 82 million .
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power in a period of severe tension with its Russian neighbour , fu@@ rious of Ki@@ ev &apos;s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November .
It was made public after the publication of official statistics showing that the country &apos;s economy had suffered from July and September its fifth quarter of the contract .
Its relatively modest debt , still relatively modest , has so@@ ared in recent years and S &amp; amp ; P to 3@@ 3.5 % of GDP , compared to less than 10 % before the 2008-@@ 2009 crisis .
The country , in the budget deficit , has for months been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund , which granted it a credit of USD 15@@ .@@ 3 billion in 2010 and has currently released only 3.@@ 4 billion .
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tran@@ che until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit , notably by increasing gas prices to the population .
After a new unsuccessful mission in the country , the IMF noted this week that &quot; major external financing needs &quot; were &quot; vulnerability &quot; , while at the same time showing &quot; signs of economic improvement &quot; .
However , for the economist O@@ le@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r J@@ ol@@ ud , the C@@ enter for Political E@@ th@@ ics , &apos; one cannot expect a short-term improvement &apos; .
&apos;@@ There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-@@ election year &apos; , the presidential elections being planned in 2015 , the expert , inter@@ viewed with the A@@ F@@ P .
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation .
S &amp; # 160 ; &amp; # 45 ; The &apos; uncertainty &apos; linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU , which Brussels depends on for the release of the opposition Yu@@ lia Ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
&apos;@@ S@@ pending the agreement would be positive for long-term trade , but there may be negative negative consequences in the short and medium terms linked to Russia &apos;s response &apos; , and has explained S &amp; P , which fears &apos; trade restrictions &apos; on the part of Moscow .
Russia , which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports , warned that , in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Ki@@ ev , it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods .
The United States Green Paper for the P@@ u@@ lic@@ ic@@ is@@ e-@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m merger
P@@ u@@ lic@@ tis and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m said on Friday that there was no objection from the US authorities to their merger , thus moving closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency .
The merger brings the second global agency , O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , and the third .
&apos;@@ O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m Group and P@@ u@@ lic@@ tis Group have today announced the expiry of the previously announced merger of P@@ u@@ lic@@ tis Group and O@@ m@@ ni@@ co@@ m , provided for by the Har@@ -@@ Scot@@ t-@@ R@@ od@@ r@@ ino An@@ aly@@ sis Act . &apos;
They state that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada , India and Turkey , after South Africa and South Korea .
The expiry of the review period planned by the H@@ S@@ R in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other juris@@ dic@@ tions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation of the operation .
&apos;@@ The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups &apos; , and they are adding .
the Congolese army hi@@ j@@ acked the rebels from M@@ 23
The Congolese army ( F@@ ARC ) announced on Thursday that its units were going to drive the rebels from M@@ 23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Ki@@ v@@ u bordering Rwanda and Uganda .
M@@ 23 is on the ver@@ ge of being beaten after being driven out of the north-@@ east of the Democratic Republic of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) , which it was controlling from the beginning , 20 months ago .
&apos;@@ We shall continue the M@@ 23 and pass it on wherever it is &apos; because it is criminals &apos; , told Re@@ u@@ ters the Col@@ on@@ el O@@ li@@ vi@@ er Ham@@ ul@@ i , spokesman for the F@@ ARC .
We must not allow them to re@@ organise themselves because they mar@@ ry the Congolese people for too long .
The time has come for peace to be restored .
M@@ 23 officials have explained that they have evac@@ uated the loc@@ alities under diplomatic pressure and Ber@@ tran@@ d B@@ is@@ sim@@ wa , who is a politician of the re@@ bel@@ lion , said on the R@@ FI that these military set@@ backs would not change his claims to the peace talks .
They , according to the Ug@@ and@@ an medi@@ ators , resumed on Wednesday in K@@ amp@@ ala between the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 .
There are cr@@ acks in the h@@ ills that dominate B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , the last town in the hands of the insur@@ gents who fell this week , and around R@@ un@@ y@@ oni , a h@@ ill where the M@@ 23 re@@ bel@@ lion came into being in 2012 .
At their peak in November , the insur@@ gents occupied G@@ om@@ a , the h@@ at in the province of North Ki@@ v@@ u , taking advantage of the flight from the governmental gar@@ d@@ on and the p@@ assi@@ vity of Mon@@ us@@ co &apos;s blue hel@@ ves .
G@@ om@@ a ’ s fall brought the United Nations Mission in the DR@@ C , the world ’ s largest workforce , to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention bri@@ g@@ ade consisting of South African , Mal@@ aw@@ an , and T@@ anz@@ anian soldiers .
For its part , the headquarters of the F@@ ARC has been re@@ constructed , and the army has gone to the offensive against M@@ 23 , which has changed the course of the war .
The pace of progress in government troops is now unprecedented .
&apos;@@ M@@ 23 seems to be coming to an end &apos; , predic@@ ting a Congolese business expert , J@@ son Ste@@ ar@@ ns , on his blo@@ g Congo Si@@ as@@ a .
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the government in Kin@@ sha@@ sa was able to beat a major insur@@ gency .
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DR@@ C .

Ch@@ ev@@ ron , the second American oil company , reported on Friday that its quar@@ terly benefit is falling because of the decline in its refin@@ ing margins , while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining behind the group &apos;s objectives .

Im@@ b@@ az@@ li@@ o around the closure of the H@@ op@@ el@@ -@@ God emergencies
Faced with the fronts of some of the staff and several trade unions , including the C@@ G@@ T , the health minister , Mar@@ is@@ ol@@ l T@@ our@@ e , on 10 July , decided to &apos; delay the timetable for implementing the project , and in particular the date of closure of emergencies which cannot take place on 4 November &apos; .
An official request &apos; to do no risk to the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter &apos; , but which also sought not to hinder the campaign campaign for a few months from the municipalities .
Despite the ministerial instructions , the closure should still be effective on that date .
Even if , in the A@@ PH@@ P , we prefer to use the term &apos; transformation &apos; or &apos; change in continuity &apos; .
As of 4 November , the fire bri@@ g@@ ades that provide around a quarter of the 40 000 annual pass@@ ages in the H@@ op@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God emergency emergencies will all have been instruc@@ ted to take 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals .
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of inter@@ mit@@ ts .
In the H@@ ho@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God , the speci@@ alized in@@ ner in@@ ner in@@ ner will leave five internal medicine .
As for the transfer of be@@ ds of internal medicine , it is scheduled for this month .
&apos;@@ The Ho@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God emergency service must close in the shor@@ test possible time , and for us , it is 4 November &apos; , un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable L@@ o@@ c C@@ ann@@ on , the chairman of the A@@ PH@@ P &apos;s Med@@ ical E@@ establishment Committee , which supports the management project .
&apos;@@ On 4 November , there will be no more patients from fire fighters , only people coming from their own means &apos; , confirms Professor Jean-@@ Y@@ ves F@@ ag@@ on , the medical head of the new H@@ op@@ t@@ el@@ -@@ God .
&apos;@@ But we shall continue to host patients as emergency &apos; , temp@@ ting them , claiming the permanent presence of SM@@ U@@ R vehicles on site to transfer serious cases .
Sen@@ ior senior doctors will remain on the spot , and they will do so .
However , it is up to the AR@@ S to decide the closure of the host service .
&apos;@@ Things are being done gradually &apos; , answers Nicol@@ as Pé@@ j@@ u , spokes@@ person for the AR@@ S , for whom , on 4 November , &apos; there will be no change in terms of the service provided &apos; .
&apos;@@ The Minister li@@ ed or li@@ ed to him &apos; , she deplo@@ res the Argen@@ tine doctor , G@@ ér@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek .
As head of the S@@ M@@ U@@ R leader at the beginning of July for leading the fron@@ t@@ line against the re@@ organisation project , it is defined as a &apos; warning k@@ n@@ ell &apos; in the face of a &apos; cynical &apos; decision taken by &apos; the police and administrative techno@@ structure &apos; .
&apos;@@ They are in the process of destroying and suff@@ oc@@ ating emergencies that were re@@ no@@ vated less than five years ago &apos; .
For him , &apos; if other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus , there would be no problem &apos; .
However , they are regularly eng@@ ul@@ f@@ ted .
For example , there are nine hours of waiting for emergencies in L@@ ari@@ bo@@ ier .
In the AR@@ S , it is argued that thirty &apos; dis@@ pe@@ lled &apos; patients on several sites are not in danger of representing a &apos; a@@ val@@ an@@ che &apos; in other emergency services , the human resources of which have also been strengthened .
In both the AR@@ S and the A@@ PH@@ P , the &apos; new hospital model &apos; has already been set up since 7 October and should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year .
By the end of the year , liberal liberal doctors should also be involved in the establishment of a &apos; permanent am@@ bul@@ atory care &apos; .
&apos;@@ Where will people be asked if people are asked to diagno@@ se themselves &apos; , ask G@@ ér@@ i@@ ld Ki@@ er@@ z@@ ek for &apos; the serious emergency concept &apos; is &apos; dangerous &apos; and marks a &apos; medical reg@@ res@@ sion &apos; .
This will happen as in the case of Level 3 mo@@ therhood .
People are not mad , they will go where there is the best offer of care .
If the Minister does not take a measure by Monday , we will change the hand , warn Chris@@ top@@ her P@@ ru@@ d@@ man , an urgent doctor and a member of the C@@ G@@ T Health .
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to think about presenting a list .
In the team of N@@ ath@@ han K@@ os@@ ci@@ us@@ k@@ o-@@ M@@ oriz@@ et , V@@ inc@@ ent Ro@@ ger , the U@@ M@@ P coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or from Paris and elected from the 4@@ th ar@@ row , clearly announ@@ ces that &quot; even if the Paris U@@ M@@ P was to maintain emergencies in H@@ ower God .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , the candidate candidate , once again recalled on Monday morning , on France , that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November .
If that were the case , it would mark its net disagreement , highlights B@@ run@@ o J@@ ul@@ li@@ ard , his spokesman .
Even if the restructuring of the H@@ op@@ el@@ -@@ God has its fundamental legitimacy , we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals .
Obama termin@@ ates the IMF and the World Bank to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) to put an end to the ta@@ pping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities , indicating an American official , Thursday .
This decision is part of the White House &apos;s attempt to take over in the N@@ SA &apos;s case of listening after the re@@ vel@@ ations made by former analy@@ sts Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , refugee in Russia .
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank surveillance has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began .
On the subject , a US administration official replied : “ The US does not carry out electronic supervision of the World Bank and IMF seats in Washington . ”
In the name of an@@ onym@@ ity , this official did not specify whether such monitoring had been established in the past .
Another official said that Barack Obama had given an order to stop these practices in the past weeks .
This in@@ struction was given at roughly the same time as that ending the head@@ phones of the UN headquarters in New York .
In this context , the sen@@ atorial Commission of Int@@ elli@@ gence approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes , but allowed them to continue .
The committee introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information .
The UN \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s New De@@ al of P@@ ack@@ aging Poverty
The United Nations will now start working on a new set of objectives aimed at replacing the Millennium Development Goals ( M@@ DGs ) , which had been set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty .
Austr@@ ali@@ an diplomats have played a key role in promoting the “ sustainable development goals ” aimed at replacing the M@@ DGs , which will exp@@ ire in 2015 , before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development , which began on the eve of Rio de J@@ an@@ e@@ iro .
They included the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs G@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
UN Secretary-General Ban K@@ i-@@ mo@@ on said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to “ go beyond national interests . ”
&apos;@@ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropri@@ ate the process of setting universal sustainable development objectives ( O@@ D@@ D ) , &apos; he added .
These D@@ D@@ D will be based on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-@@ 2015 development framework .
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the M@@ DGs .
The security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as there are conflicts between powerful figures .
The founding president of Mozambique , the founding president of Mozambique , who to@@ iled them , thousands of people gathered in the centre of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to to d@@ rown peaceful slog@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
&apos;@@ We want peace to return ; we want stability &apos; , said V@@ an@@ ess@@ a de S@@ ous@@ a , the Director-General of an investment society .
In@@ spi@@ red for the future of his country , she has exchanged his working clothing against a te@@ e-@@ shir@@ t with the mention &apos; We want security &apos; in Portuguese before joining the crow@@ ded crow@@ d on the Independence of the capital of the capital Thursday .
For two weeks , there were almost every day reports of conflicts between government forces and the Rena@@ o , the worst cl@@ ou@@ ds since the peace agreement signed more than 20 years ago .
The Rena@@ o was once a famous rebel movement , backed initially by R@@ ho@@ de@@ sia governed by wh@@ ites and then the apar@@ theid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabili@@ ze the country ’ s independent government .
After a peace agreement signed in 1992 , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict , but recent events have sha@@ ken foreign investors and the local population .
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy , as the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-@@ west could attract more than $ 50 trillion of investment over the coming years from companies like Rio T@@ in@@ o , Brazil ’ s V@@ ale , E@@ neither Italy , and An@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko in the United States .
The F@@ lag@@ o , the governing party , and the main political force since 197@@ 5 , and the Rena@@ o blame each other for tensions .
The Rena@@ o dec@@ la@@ res that the government was responsible for the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in So@@ f@@ a province , a traditional bas@@ tion of the Rena@@ o on 17 October .
The assa@@ ults on former rebels then de@@ generated when government forces attacked the Rena@@ o bases and attempted to kill A@@ af@@ so D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama , the group leader , and Fer@@ nan@@ do Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a , the R@@ o spokesman , according to the Financial Times .
The government makes the Rena@@ o responsible for trigg@@ ering conflicts , and accused it of attacking soldiers .
President Ar@@ man@@ do Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to minim@@ ize concerns about instability .
Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za said on Wednesday to the A@@ F@@ P , the French press agency , that Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ ama regarded himself as a &apos; los@@ er &apos; who wanted to use &apos; all the forces he left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government &apos; .
The F@@ lag@@ o and Ren@@ y insist that they both want to avoid war .
But the concern grew up after Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a said that the Rena@@ us was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .
He said at the F@@ T that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the F@@ lag@@ o .
&apos;@@ We want to resume the negotiations , but with the utmost seriousness &apos; , Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a has indicated .
Pre@@ vious discussions between the parties have failed to all@@ ay the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year .
“ These are two great men ( Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and D@@ h@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who have not stopped arguing , and explained Jose@@ p@@ h H@@ an@@ l@@ on , a conf@@ er of the open and specialist University of Mozambique .
None of them knows well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
The Rena@@ o , which is in favour of electoral reforms , had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to take place in November .
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year .
Some com@@ ment@@ ators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a trea@@ sure of war by the government .
The share of the votes collected by the Ren@@ ce has been declining since 1992 , while a new party , the Mozambique Democratic Movement ( M@@ D@@ M ) , which was created by a former R@@ o member , should gain more votes in the elections .
Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said that Mr Gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country .
&quot; He does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency &quot; , said Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a .
We do not know exactly what the Rena@@ o &apos;s capacity is , but it has carried out sha@@ m@@ eless attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-@@ south motor@@ way axis .
Most of the cl@@ ou@@ ds have taken place in the province of So@@ fa@@ a , which is situated several hundred kilometres away from the north of M@@ ap@@ u@@ to , but where there is Be@@ ira , where mining companies , particularly Rio T@@ in@@ o and V@@ ale , are exporting coal .
In June , Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the R@@ o threatened to attack the railway line .
Mr Ma@@ az@@ ang@@ a was mis@@ ta@@ k@@ enly ti@@ mid when he was asked whether the R@@ et would respond to this threat .
The Ren@@ o wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique , ” Mr Ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a indicated .
instability has strengthened the fru@@ stra@@ tions of the government , dec@@ la@@ res Fer@@ nan@@ do L@@ ima , the director of Me@@ di@@ ac@@ op , an independent media company , and many people are also concerned about corruption , slow development and the recent wave of kidn@@ app@@ ings .
&apos;@@ People think that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the President , and that it is up to him to find solutions to the problems &apos; , he explained .
Om@@ ar S@@ ul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstration , said that people only wanted stability .
“ Nobody ca@@ res about the Ren@@ o or F@@ RO@@ NT@@ o , they just want to return to peace , they want free access to roads , ” he added .
We should learn the my@@ ths and le@@ gen@@ ds to children as “ lifestyle models , ” the author says .
Th@@ or ’ s L@@ ory could show that “ the brutal force does not wi@@ eld weight in the face of sub@@ tle ru@@ se , ” while ar@@ the@@ al le@@ gen@@ ds reveal the importance of having a dream .
To say that many my@@ ths would be “ far too violent , far too scandalous , and in some cases far too obscure to be taught at school , ” Cro@@ s@@ le@@ -@@ Hol@@ and advocated a “ careful selection ” of works suited to age .
&apos;@@ I find it wonderful that in America , my@@ ths and fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore are already part of education &apos; .
I have been in favour of this project for 20 years .
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “ openly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic ” means that children are “ completely out ” , the messages being “ sub@@ li@@ ed ” in pleasant stories .
Cro@@ us@@ -@@ Holland , who translated Be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon and wrote the Pen@@ g@@ in Bo@@ ok of Nor@@ se My@@ th@@ s and British Vol@@ k T@@ ales , said : “ You may have good intentions , but you want to keep them out of sight . ”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writ@@ er writ@@ er for adults and an adult writ@@ er writing for children is the need to offer hope .
Not that everything needs to be simplified or completed , but there is an un@@ born sense of good and evil .
And it must be sub@@ li@@ ed ; revealed through a history rather than declared .
The well-known basis of what is shown and is not said .
An armed branch of Hamas has been killed this evening and another w@@ ounded by a fire of Israeli pra@@ yer in the Gaza Strip was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza .
According to these sources , these activists led to a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they seized a sh@@ re@@ w@@ d sh@@ ell of an Israeli b@@ ann@@ er .
E@@ vi@@ dence of the N@@ SA : the US is &apos; gone too far &apos; .
The US has sometimes gone “ too far ” in es@@ pion@@ age , recognized Secretary of State John Ker@@ ry , in Washington ’ s first conf@@ ession in the midst of Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency ( N@@ SA ) .
After ten days of scandal , re@@ vel@@ ations and den@@ i@@ als between the US and its European allies , this is the first time that an American official official has explicitly recognised controversial practices in the N@@ SA inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and data in Europe .
&apos;@@ In some cases I conc@@ ede that , as the President has done , some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to ensure that this is no longer in the future &apos; , said John Ker@@ ry at a conference in London which he had been participating in since Washington on Thursday , 31 October .
In his re@@ submitted speech , in the presence of his British counterpart Wil@@ lia@@ m Hague , US diplomacy has long justified the intelligence and gathering of information by the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention against possible attacks .
In@@ vo@@ ining the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005 , John Ker@@ ry ensured that the US authorities had since de@@ posed numerous attacks , thanks to the inter@@ c@@ eption of communications and the collection of information .
&apos;@@ We have in fact prevented aircraft from falling , buildings are not explo@@ red and people are being murdered , because we were able to be informed in advance of these projects &apos; , and argued the bos@@ s of American diplomacy .
And , having said John Ker@@ ry to the Europeans , &apos; I assure you that in this process of innocent people has not been dec@@ eived &apos; .
But we are trying to gather information .
&apos;@@ And yes , in some cases it has gone too far &apos; , has still admitted the Secretary of State , who had already had to speak on this international scandal at a tour last week in Paris , London and Rome .
On Thursday evening he assured us that President Obama was &apos; determined to try and clarify and review these practices so that nobody feels wrong &apos; .
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to inc@@ ur this week with new re@@ vel@@ ations in the press .
According to the Washington Po@@ st , the N@@ SA inter@@ cep@@ ted data of hundreds of millions of Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o users .
The newspaper , which quot@@ es documents from the former N@@ SA consul@@ tant Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , states that the &apos; M@@ US@@ C@@ U@@ R &apos; programme , with the British N@@ SA counterpart , G@@ C@@ H@@ Q , allows both agencies to recover data from the op@@ tical fi@@ b@@ res used by Internet gi@@ ants .
According to one of the documents , some 18@@ 1 million elements had been collected in January last year - ranging from me@@ tr@@ ics to e-@@ ma@@ ils , text elements or audi@@ o or video documents .
These inter@@ cep@@ tions would take place outside the US .
But Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and Google denied any connection with these practices .
For ten days , several major newspapers in France , Germany , Spain , and Italy have revealed that the N@@ SA would have inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from allies from the US and their leaders , including German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
Faced with the anger of European states , and while lea@@ ks in the American press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listened , Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject , invo@@ king national security .
On the other hand , the bos@@ s of powerful N@@ SA , General K@@ ev@@ h Alexander , has denied him that his intelligence agency has cap@@ tured tens of millions of communications from European citizens .
He even referred the ball to the European intelligence services who would have seized these communications before providing them with the N@@ SA .
This would involve &apos; military operations &apos; in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States , and that would not be aimed at Europe .
And the controversy spread on Friday to Asia .
Indonesia has convened Australia &apos;s ambassador , whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international es@@ pion@@ age network , which has also provoked China .
Paris Sain@@ t Ger@@ man@@ a will receive L@@ or@@ te Friday without his master asset , the Swed@@ e Z@@ la@@ tan I@@ bra@@ him@@ o@@ vic , who is injured , announcing the League 1 club in a communi@@ qu@@ é .
The P@@ S@@ G , the leader of the cham@@ pion@@ ship in Mon@@ ac@@ o , unlike aims , broadcast the list of players detained for the 12@@ th day match , without there being the 32 years .
The communi@@ qu@@ é simply says that it is &apos; injured &apos; , without specifying the nature of the injury .
However , he was suffering from the in@@ hi@@ b@@ itation of the left in his return to selection at the beginning of the month .
A ceremony in memory of the dec@@ e@@ ased dec@@ e@@ ased
At 11 a.m. , a secular ceremony , in memory of all the dec@@ e@@ ased dec@@ e@@ ased in its establishment during the year , organis@@ es a secular ceremony .
An@@ ne H@@ id@@ al@@ go , a Socialist candidate in the Paris City , must attend there and then explain at a press conference his proposals on fun@@ eral .
In order to follow the ceremony , let me quote the above .
For their own histor@@ ies , more and more French choose cre@@ eping , rather than in@@ hum@@ ation : 53 % , according to a I@@ p@@ so@@ s study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 100@@ 9 people , instead of 47 % .
The opposite is the case : the French prefer in@@ hum@@ ation ( 53 % against 47 % ) .
If they have the mis@@ fortune to lose a child , they are only 15 % to choose the cre@@ am .
In his book the De@@ ath in the ash , Dam@@ i Le Gu@@ ay , the philosop@@ her and vice-@@ president of the National Committee on E@@ th@@ ics of E@@ th@@ ics , insists on the &apos; violence &apos; of cre@@ eping , for survi@@ v@@ ors .
With the creation , &apos; violence of the loved body &apos; , which is going to be &apos; reduced to a lot of ash &apos; in a very short space of time , not after a process of dec@@ ay , which &apos; would accompany the phases of m@@ our@@ ning &apos; .
There is also &apos; symbolic violence &apos; , which consists of &apos; er@@ asing sing@@ ul@@ arity and distingu@@ ishing signs &apos; to the &apos; an@@ onym@@ ity &apos; of the ash .
Why is it that , in some Nordic countries and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts , what is readily accepted is still ill-@@ lived in France ?
&apos;@@ Because the creation is a new fact &apos; , answers Mari@@ e-@@ Fr@@ é@@ de@@ que B@@ ac@@ és , chair@@ person of the Th@@ an@@ at@@ ology Society and author of the book Ap@@ er .
It has been tolerated only since 196@@ 3 by the Catholic Church , which has limited the attempts to ap@@ portion it .
To call for the creation is for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Mit@@ ho@@ d-@@ N@@ ér@@ ard , Director General of the H@@ ille H@@ ei@@ ghts in the City of Paris , to provide for the de@@ func@@ t a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled .
The annual I@@ p@@ so@@ s survey shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony .
77 % of the French want one , for their loved ones , to be religious ( 53 % ) , or civilian ( 24 % ) .
Now 73 % of those who have chosen a cre@@ at want a ceremony .
66 % of a@@ the@@ ists or non-@@ beli@@ ever@@ s also want it .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ ans have adapted to this development in society .
&quot; For ten years , they have been trying to avoid the violence of a wait for families , without doing anything , for an hour and a half , immediately followed by the surrender of the ash &quot; , observing Mr Mic@@ ho@@ d-@@ N@@ ér@@ ard .
70 % of the institutions now offer cere@@ mon@@ ial ma@@ sters , who carry out the body , the following rit@@ ual : welcoming the assembly , nam@@ ing the de@@ func@@ t , linking it to others , raising it , giving meaning to his death , organising the good@@ ness .
This is the case with the C@@ ar L@@ ach@@ y cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um since 1998 .
The ma@@ sters of ceremony are often people who have re@@ converted .
There are also former Catholic pri@@ ests .
It is in this context that since 2010 the cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um of the Fa@@ ther L@@ ash@@ a@@ is has been organising a number of cere@@ monies of rememb@@ r@@ ance , secular and non-@@ religious , to which he inv@@ ites the families of those who were creative in the year .
For the second con@@ secu@@ tive year , one of these cere@@ monies is re@@ transmitted to those who could not travel .
The cre@@ mat@@ ori@@ um has allowed us to em@@ ul@@ ate it .
In the S@@ ey@@ e , housing re@@ housing as a result of r@@ ats turns into controversy .
At the beginning of the week , a family left its a@@ partment at the he@@ ight of the F@@ ru@@ ti@@ d@@ or D@@ 2 building , owing to the presence of r@@ ats .
Faced with the urgency of the situation , the Director of the South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at Office of South H@@ ab@@ it@@ at has , in an exceptional and provisional way , proposed that the couple and its three children be reset@@ tled in a new T@@ 4 .
Yet the family refuses &apos; for financial reasons &apos; and the situation is blocked .
The case has assumed exaggerated proportions , estimates Jo@@ el Can@@ ma@@ a , the director of the office .
There have always been r@@ ats in the cities .
The insurance company carries out two pass@@ ages per year , and we are dealing with every request from the inhabitants .
We have therefore made 64 speeches since the end of last winter .
The neigh@@ bor@@ hood is not abandoned , and r@@ ats do not sp@@ ill into the city .
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health , de@@ priv@@ ation products are four times less efficient than in the past , but for two r@@ ats we are not going to kill a taste .
&apos;@@ We have not invited the r@@ ats &apos; , defending the family father who has left his house to settle in the ho@@ tel .
We are soon without the o@@ u and we expect a new housing , at the same rate as the old one .

A fire that started on Friday mid@@ day in the Vi@@ e@@ be@@ c was quickly controlled .
More than 30 fire@@ fighters have been sent to the 9 out of the He@@ br@@ ert street .
The fl@@ ames have declared themselves in a house of three houses divided over four c@@ ages behind the court of Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
Not all the ten@@ ants were present during the fire .
The fire was controlled one hour after the arrival of the fire@@ fighters , many of whom spoke .
As soon as our first fire@@ men arrived , they really saw the smoke .
&apos;@@ So the al@@ arms have succeeded , because it took a step in the right direction to attack the building , because it is buildings that are assemb@@ led here &apos; , explained France L@@ ong@@ le , the spokes@@ men for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c fire@@ men .
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire .
Ben Green@@ man : 10@@ th anniversary of the New York Com@@ ed@@ y F@@ es@@ val : The New Yor@@ ker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the standard in America was born : almost 100 years ago , the pre@@ dominant actor Fr@@ ank Fo@@ ay , who held the role of a ceremony in the Pal@@ ace The@@ at@@ re , on Bro@@ ad@@ way , began to tell the public directly about the tone of the convers@@ ation .
F@@ ay ’ s innovation has been perpetu@@ ated over the years , until being taken up more recently by the New York Com@@ ed@@ y F@@ es@@ val .
C@@ reat@@ ed and super@@ vised by Car@@ ol@@ ine H@@ ir@@ sch , the foun@@ der of the Car@@ ol@@ ine standard , the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val celebr@@ ates his tenth anniversary this year , with more than 60 spectac@@ les presented in small clubs and theat@@ res .
“ Most of the heads of post@@ ers emerged in the Car@@ ol@@ in , and had a great success , until they became too famous to play in a club , ” H@@ ir@@ sch said .
We have created this f@@ es@@ ti@@ val so that we can continue working with them .
The event this year will see the participation of W@@ anda Sy@@ es , K@@ a@@ thy G@@ ri@@ ff@@ in and Bill Mah@@ er and the presentation of “ St@@ ang U@@ p for Her@@ es , ” a com@@ ra@@ de and music for the former combat@@ ants , organized in Mad@@ ison St@@ ing@@ er , J@@ on Ste@@ war@@ t , Ro@@ ger W@@ ast@@ ers and Bill Co@@ s@@ by .
The f@@ es@@ ti@@ val has grown up , as has the world of the com@@ edy .
Many of the com@@ e@@ ers who participate in this year ’ s f@@ es@@ ti@@ val have gone through non-@@ traditional cir@@ cu@@ its , for example , with spectac@@ les on small television channels , such as Com@@ ed@@ y Central Com@@ ed@@ y , F@@ X , and S@@ pi@@ ke .
N@@ ick K@@ ro@@ l@@ l has appeared in the front row in a c@@ able of a c@@ able chain ( “ The League ” on the subject of the jo@@ y@@ fully mo@@ c@@ ked so@@ cc@@ er football in the F@@ X@@ X chain ) and now has its own spectac@@ le of sk@@ et@@ ch@@ s on Central Com@@ ed@@ y .
Je@@ ren@@ y S@@ la@@ te participated in the “ St@@ ud@@ y N@@ ight Li@@ ve ” programme and was part of the “ Par@@ ks and Rec@@ re@@ ation ” series , but it is more known for his series of vir@@ al vide@@ os “ Mar@@ c@@ el the S@@ hell , S@@ hell . ”
K@@ ro@@ l@@ l and S@@ la@@ te , as well as other young people with a sing@@ ular voice ( the sur@@ realistic pessimis@@ t An@@ th@@ ony J@@ es@@ el@@ ni@@ k , the ir@@ ony of racial justice , W. K@@ am@@ u Bel@@ l ) , are products from the decentr@@ alized world of the American com@@ e@@ er .
One of the most important factors in the f@@ es@@ ti@@ val this year will be : David Ste@@ in@@ berg talks with Lar@@ ry David .
Ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stand@@ -@@ off , but he has become a film and television fil@@ ter accomplished , as well as an u@@ no@@ fficial histor@@ ian in the shop .
Between 2005 and 2007 , he had a broadcast on TV L@@ and called “ S@@ it D@@ ow@@ n Com@@ ed@@ y , David Ste@@ in@@ berg . ”
The meeting takes place at the H@@ ille de V@@ ille in the centre of Man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ The city is definitively in the com@@ ic DNA of all Lar@@ ry ’ s work , ” said Ste@@ in@@ berg .
He told me that when he was here , sometimes he was going down a ru@@ g between two buildings and said , if I lose all my money , perhaps I will live here .
oil prices continue to fall and close to $ 96 per bar@@ rel .
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday , while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that China ’ s energy-@@ intensive manufacturing sector is growing .
The price of the US benchmark for delivery in December fell from 14 c@@ ents to $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 per bar@@ rel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mer@@ can@@ tile Ex@@ change ( N@@ Y@@ ME@@ X ) .
The contract lost 39 c@@ ents on Thursday , leaving it with 5.@@ 8 % in October .
The abund@@ ant supply of crude oil has been on the price in recent weeks .
The US Department of Energy indicated on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ rel@@ s last week .
Over five weeks , supplies have increased by more than 25 million bar@@ rel@@ s .
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday , which show growth in activity , suggest an increase in demand .
This suggests that China ’ s economic recovery could continue to shrin@@ k after growth rose to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a fall that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter .
G@@ rent B@@ rent , a reference to international crude oil already used by American refin@@ eries , has lost 26 c@@ ents to fall to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 per bar@@ rel over the Inter@@ -@@ Con@@ st@@ inal Ex@@ change ( I@@ EC ) in London .
The right to abortion in T@@ ex@@ as
A Federal Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al has restored some restrictions to T@@ ex@@ as on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy which had been blocked by a first-@@ instance judge this week .
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that state and seriously questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .
The ruling by the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al means that doctors who operate V@@ V@@ G will have to have a &apos; admission privilege &apos; to local hospitals .
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor , under his status as a hospital member , to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to provide diagnosis or treatment there .
I@@ V@@ G advocates argue that the content of the law is likely to lead to an immediate closure of one-third of state clin@@ ics , because these clin@@ ics have failed to obtain this &apos; admission privilege &apos; for their practi@@ tioners .
In total , it would be 2@@ 2@@ ,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments .
On Monday , a first-@@ rate judge estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were un@@ constitutional .
But the At@@ tor@@ ney General of T@@ ex@@ as , the Republican , Gre@@ g Ab@@ bot@@ t , who is acting as govern@@ or , asked the Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al to cancel the first-@@ ruling judgment that blocked the application of the law .
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January .
The New Sta@@ r has been able to return to force , the audi@@ ences , with 1.3 million view@@ ers behind their tele@@ phones , or 5.@@ 6 % of the audience .
But was the spectac@@ le at the meeting ?
Some 10 000 candidates appeared to the hearings of this 10@@ th season , to confront the jury : Ma@@ ran@@ e , the S@@ inc@@ is , the per@@ y An@@ dr@@ é Man@@ ou@@ ki@@ an and O@@ li@@ vi@@ er B@@ as .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , view@@ ers shared their comments .
Many people have been disappointed by the exc@@ itement to return to their fav@@ our@@ ite programme .
But why is so much disappointment about this ?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium .
As every year , the first hearing broad@@ casts have a wide choice of grass , for better and sometimes for worse .
On T@@ wit@@ ter , we want spectac@@ le , emotion , origin@@ ality , music ...
Fortunately , some of them have found their way .
Many of them tried New Sta@@ r and sometimes even went to the end .
Beh@@ ind the television scre@@ ens , successful s@@ ong voting is still there , season after season .
Others have just the ambition to lau@@ gh .
The Court is blocking a decision on the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D control and sear@@ ching policy
A Federal Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and sear@@ ching programme of the police department in New York .
The US Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al ( second cir@@ cu@@ it ) has indicated that Jud@@ ge Shi@@ ra Sch@@ e@@ ind@@ in &apos;s decision was suspended until the end of the appeal by the city .
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and question citizens .
The city has made use of its conclusions and corrective prescri@@ ptions , including a decision to award a contro@@ ller to help the police department change its policy and its associated training programme .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the request for suspension .
The Court of Ap@@ pe@@ al has said that the judge should be instruc@@ tive because it infring@@ ed the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality , partly because of a series of media talks and public statements in which she publicly responds to the Court &apos;s criticism .
The judge ruled that police officers were violating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and xenophobic men in their control and sear@@ ches .
It has appointed an external contro@@ ller to supervise the changes , in particular the reform of policies , training and supervision , and has ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test cam@@ er@@ as on the body where the greatest number of controls are carried out .
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control .
The hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after 14 March 2014 .
The tactics of control and sear@@ ches have been criticised by many civil rights defenders .
This system of control and sear@@ ches has been in some form for decades , but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent may@@ or Mic@@ hael Blo@@ om@@ berg , to reach its highest historic level in 2011 with 6@@ 84 3@@ 30 controls , mainly related to black and xenophobic men .
Legal action was introduced in 2004 by four men , all of them from minorities , and turned into collective action .
Ad@@ voc@@ ates who advocate changes in the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D ’ s control and sear@@ ches are saying that they will put an end to unfair practices , make police forces more effective and trust , and can change the way in which police departments use politics .
Op@@ ponents say that these changes would undermine police mor@@ als without reducing crime , would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police staff have been significantly reduced in the last decade .
The judge pointed out that it does not put an end to the control and sear@@ ches , which are constitutional , but to reform the way the N@@ Y@@ P@@ D implemented its controls .
The ten@@ ants must vote , because each of them pays on average $ 100 a month on the price of housing that goes on to the V@@ ille .
When the owner pays $ 5@@ ,000 in municipal taxes , he divi@@ des that amount between every housing .
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes .
By voting , we are sending out a clear message .
We need to change things in the V@@ ille .
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt .
We no longer have the means to pay fire@@ works at $ 100@@ ,000 , from $ 4 to 5 million in case ...
G@@ o to vote , that is the best way to speak and say that it is enough .
The E@@ ly@@ s@@ e chief of E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e
In the 500 m@@ 2 m@@ 2 of el@@ y@@ se@@ an k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens as committed after working in embassies , the co@@ ok has clim@@ bed every r@@ ank up to the head , nine years ago .
He served six French presidents , Ge@@ org@@ es P@@ om@@ pid@@ ou to Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de , to Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , including on their holiday places , and nur@@ tured an inc@@ al@@ cul@@ able number of the world ’ s major big people in a qu@@ asi@@ -@@ an@@ onym@@ ity that he only d@@ row@@ ned at age 60 .
A man with an open face , a ro@@ gue , and an intellectual cl@@ out , born on 24 October 195@@ 3 in the Fer@@ te@@ -@@ Sain@@ t Au@@ bi@@ in , holds a pa@@ st@@ ure .
His mother was himself co@@ o@@ king in a cast@@ le of S@@ olo@@ gna .
&apos;@@ I have moved from a cast@@ le to the other ! &apos; , ir@@ on@@ ise Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ impact , who knows not only the six presidents for whom he was appointed , but also their wi@@ ves and some of their distinguished gu@@ ests .
&apos;@@ It is always the head of the state or his compan@@ ions or wife who choose the men@@ us &apos; .
&apos;@@ Mrs Chirac was a little more involved , she came straight to the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en &apos; , to the point she had banned women in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e k@@ it@@ ch@@ en !
With regard to the heads of state who displayed relative indifference to land fe@@ eds , &apos; they are all gre@@ edy &apos; , and they are denoun@@ cing Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ impact .
Jacques Chirac certainly had a somewhat more developed appe@@ ti@@ te .
But with Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , who removed che@@ ese , the st@@ ars were empty !
As for Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de , who restored che@@ ese , &apos; it is someone who likes to eat &apos; and &apos; there is little that he does not like &apos; .
The current Head of State , who reg@@ ain@@ ed the kil@@ os lost before the presidential campaign , has &apos; no specific regime demand &apos; .
Ber@@ n@@ ard V@@ au@@ impact also remember the pressure on his shoulders , especially at the state din@@ ners in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e : &quot; between 200 and 250 people must be used in approximately one hour &apos; .
The night before is almost white .
These people would not understand if there were any mistakes .
Now the former E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e k@@ it@@ ch@@ en leader , who took a glass on Tuesday evening with his team , family and friends , comes to the heart of &apos; Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de &apos; .
He has said praise for this .
He has come out , he says .
The leader will be replaced by his deputy , Wil@@ hel@@ m G@@ ome@@ z , 35 years , who for his part has been in the E@@ ly@@ s@@ é@@ e for 17 years .
F@@ ine in a house built in 18@@ 50 to Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c
An historic house built in 18@@ 50 was the pre@@ y of the fl@@ ames in the Vi@@ -@@ Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c on Friday noon .
The four@@ -@@ house building , on the 15 of the He@@ br@@ ert street , was the subject of three al@@ arms in the fire service .
The fire has gone ahead , but it has been on the three sides of the building .
France , the spokes@@ person for the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c fire protection service , made it clear that rapid fire intervention has prevented the spread of fl@@ ames to ad@@ jac@@ ent buildings , a major challenge for this sector in the city where buildings are built in a close way .
The house bur@@ ned with four houses , but no ten@@ ants were on the scene at the time of the fire .
The damage was limited , even though water caused damage .
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin , but the gun@@ s have removed the thesis of a criminal act .

C@@ l@@ ul@@ son has used the telephone piracy to check a tu@@ g-@@ up tu@@ e
The former ed@@ it@@ or-@@ in-@@ chief of Ne@@ ws of the World An@@ dy C@@ l@@ ul@@ son would have used &apos; telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation &apos; to try to confirm a bi@@ d tu@@ e on a link involving the Minister for Home Affairs , Charles C@@ lar@@ ke .
The Chief Prosecutor An@@ drew E@@ d@@ is Q@@ C told the World B@@ ai@@ ley Court that Ne@@ ws of the World had heard a false rum@@ our in May 2005 that C@@ lar@@ ke had a relationship with H@@ and@@ h P@@ w@@ l@@ by , his “ beautiful special advis@@ er . ”
It was pointed out to the court that the newspaper charged G@@ len@@ n Mo@@ c@@ aire , a private de@@ priv@@ ation , to pir@@ ate P@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s box and to &apos; keep his door permanently &apos; , but C@@ l@@ ul@@ son also called it and left him with voice messages .
&quot; The accusation suggests that Mr C@@ oul@@ son , who is now the ed@@ it@@ or-@@ in-@@ chief of No@@ t@@ W , is not the kind of man to stay at the home of people in hoping to surprise them , it is the kind of man to love to present history to people to see what they say .
He said that N@@ ot@@ W used three means to investigate matters : telephone piracy , surveillance and confrontation .
The ed@@ it@@ or-@@ in-@@ chief is personally involved in the third .
It is clear that he is aware of the second , the supervision , that cannot be otherwise .
But what about the first of these ? What about the first ?
Is he aware of the telephone piracy ?
He says the opposite , but we say , ‘ Of course , if ’ .
S@@ hor@@ ts about a connection involving C@@ lar@@ ke were first taken up by the No@@ t@@ W Mar@@ ine Office when a source , with a sexual attr@@ acti@@ veness to M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by , said that he was told : “ Do not lose the time with her , she is with Charles . ”
A band , on which there were pir@@ ated voice messages on its phone to at least three times , was seized at the house of S@@ ic@@ ary in August 2006 .
In@@ v@@ estig@@ ators have also found se@@ iz@@ ures on the computer of the private dec@@ e@@ it@@ ce that concerned M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by and his s@@ ister s@@ ister in a “ Pro@@ ject ” dossier .
During the period when the de@@ t@@ achment investigated her , M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received an@@ onymous calls for information on her , added to Mr E@@ d@@ is .
In the meantime , the former postponement of N@@ vil@@ le Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former postponement James We@@ a@@ er@@ ut over@@ saw the little of M@@ iss P@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s little record and gest@@ ures .
In a voice message he left on 18 June 2005 , C@@ l@@ ul@@ son said : ‘ I have a history that we plan to publish tomorrow , which I would really like to talk about in Charles . ’
Mr E@@ sc@@ is explained that the involvement of C@@ oul@@ son in history has followed the same pattern as other important men , such as the former Minister for Home Affairs David B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t .
The jury heard on Thursday that C@@ ul@@ son had to face Mr B@@ un@@ ke@@ t@@ t on a connection with a married woman when he attended the co-@@ def@@ end@@ se Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah Bro@@ o@@ ks , who was also married at that time .
C@@ l@@ ul@@ son and Bro@@ o@@ ks deny that they con@@ spi@@ red with others to pir@@ ate tele@@ phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .
Mo@@ c@@ aire , Th@@ ur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and We@@ a@@ ther@@ up admitted to have carried out a telephone piracy .
Barack Obama receives Iraq ’ s Prime Minister , in the midst of violence
US President N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , who was seeking help from the United States in order to combat the greatest wave of violence for five years , was to receive the US President .
In October , Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years , according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday 1 November .
9@@ 64 people died in violence in October , including 8@@ 55 civilians , 65 polic@@ emen and 44 soldiers , and 1 600 people were injured .
The UN has a higher toll with 9@@ 79 deaths and 1 9@@ 02 injured .
This violence is increasingly mur@@ der@@ ous , despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki government , dominated by the Shia .
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008 , when 1 0@@ 73 people were killed .
Two years after the withdrawal of US troops , the level of violence is causing fear of a new conf@@ lag@@ r@@ ation when neighb@@ oring Syria is in the grip of a civil war .
The bombs hit markets , mo@@ squ@@ es , marriages and fun@@ erals .
Men are slaughtered in the middle of the street or even at home , and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks .
The growing dis@@ content of the Sunni minority , in power under Saddam Hussein , who complain@@ s of being politically margin@@ alized and of being the target of unfair arrests , has encouraged this surge in violence .
On Friday , further violence killed four people in northern Iraq , following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks , including the explosion of five cars in northern Baghdad .
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Lev@@ ant ( EI@@ I@@ L ) , a group belonging to al-@@ Qaeda ( Sunni extremists ) , which is also involved in Syria ’ s civil war .
N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki wants a “ global war ” against al-@@ Qaeda .
The violence is at the center of US Prime Minister N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki ’ s talks , which will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama , two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011 .
At that time , the US President , elected on the promise of an end to military engagement in that country , had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation .
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington , N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki has increased meetings with the executive , and Cong@@ res@@ sional elected representatives .
On Thursday , he argued for the international community to conduct a &apos; Third World War &apos; against al-@@ Qaeda .
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican sen@@ ators and democrats .
But the US also criticized N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki , a Shia , and as@@ signs him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his “ sec@@ tarian and authoritarian politics . ”
They also demanded Barack Obama to make N@@ our@@ i al-@@ M@@ ali@@ ki understand that “ Iran ’ s per@@ nic@@ ious influence in the Iraqi Government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship . ”
Beijing acc@@ uses an U@@ igh@@ ur group of the Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men attack in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men
The Chinese internal security chief accused of a group of U@@ y@@ ji@@ ang separati@@ sts on Friday to be behind the car bomb attack that killed five deaths in Ti@@ an@@ an@@ men Square in the Beijing centre on Monday .
The vehicle , a S@@ U@@ V , has sun@@ k on the crow@@ ds that were on the famous place of the Chinese capital , symbol of the mur@@ der@@ ous repression in 1989 , and sho@@ oting its three passengers and two people .
Men@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , a member of the political Bureau responsible for internal security matters , accused the Islamic Movement of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan to be the instig@@ ator of this attack .
Many U@@ igh@@ urs , a Turk@@ ish-@@ speaking minority in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , call this Chinese province in Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan .
For the Chinese Government , this movement is responsible for the frequent erup@@ tions of violence that occur there , driven by independence claims .
&apos;@@ The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organised and pre@@ med@@ it@@ ated &apos; , and said Men@@ g to the chain of hon@@ or k@@ ong@@ i@@ x TV .
&apos;@@ The group behind the scenes was the Islamic Movement in Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan &apos; , he added , as he said , being taken over by the new China agency .
The Chinese police have identified the vehicle driver whose name suggests that he is of U@@ y@@ gh@@ ur origin and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car .
The latter also contained petrol re@@ porters with petrol and a flag with Or@@ thodox religious en@@ tries .
The incident has made 42 injured .
The Islamic Movement in Eastern Tur@@ ke@@ stan is seen as a terrorist organisation by the US and the United Nations .
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on contrac@@ eption , divorce and homosexu@@ ality
The V@@ a@@ tic@@ an has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world about how the par@@ ks handle sensitive issues such as contrac@@ eption , divorce , and couples with the same sex .
The poll asks participants how pri@@ ests look after gay couples and their children , and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by marriage ties .
The poll was sent in mid-@@ October at every national conference of b@@ ish@@ ops , with the instructions to obtain as many answers as possible .
Information will serve an important r@@ ally on the family that the French Pope is planning next year .
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Ca@@ thol@@ ics Re@@ porting , an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States .
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic b@@ ish@@ ops in the United States confirmed that the document was auth@@ enti@@ c and that every b@@ is@@ ho@@ p would decide in the appropriate way to look at the par@@ is@@ si@@ ers .
In the UK , b@@ ish@@ ops published the Internet survey by asking Ca@@ thol@@ ics to participate .
DR@@ C : The army is attacking the last fi@@ ghts of the rebels of the rebels .
The im@@ plac@@ able M@@ 23 , a few hundred combat@@ ants , were entren@@ ched to almost 2000 metres of al@@ titude on the agricultural h@@ ills of Chancellor R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ ub@@ z@@ i , near B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana and J@@ om@@ a , two loc@@ alities located at around 80 km in northern G@@ om@@ a , the capital of North Ki@@ v@@ u province .
&apos;@@ It has not stopped since this morning , the fighting continues despite the night &apos; , indicated to the A@@ F@@ P a resident of J@@ om@@ a , joined by telephone at 12.@@ 30 p.m. , and according to which a gir@@ l was injured by bul@@ let in the morning .
&apos;@@ The intensity of the clashes has diminished slightly &apos; , he added , &apos; it seems that the DR@@ C F@@ ARC For@@ ces of the DR@@ C have pushed the rebels a little further . &apos;
According to the witness who wanted to remain an@@ onymous , the soldiers had &quot; spent the night &quot; in J@@ om@@ a before they set up for a &quot; se@@ wage operation &quot; .
It was very clear behind him that cre@@ ep@@ ers fed with light weapons were fed up .
From B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana , a political post@@ ure , and the last strong place of the re@@ bel@@ lion fell on Wednesday , an A@@ F@@ P journalist could have heard of heavy weap@@ on@@ ry .
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DR@@ C , the fighting entered &apos; in a final phase &apos; , the F@@ ARC having &apos; en@@ vy the positions of the M@@ 23 resid@@ ual to de@@ part them &apos; .
Since the resumption , on Friday , of the clashes between the 23 Mar@@ s Movement ( M@@ 23 ) and the army , Mon@@ us@@ co is not directly involved in the fighting , but it is providing government troops with decisive support for intelligence , observation and planning .
At the end of the afternoon , several dozens of soldiers , well supplied by am@@ muni@@ tion , came to the front line .
They were armed with Kal@@ ash@@ ni@@ kov and roc@@ ket laun@@ chers .
Ear@@ lier on , on the road to B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , a border post with Uganda , soldiers who were ai@@ ded by civilians were carrying a multi@@ fac@@ eted roc@@ ket on a lorry f@@ iling nine of the F@@ ARC , to take over from another cr@@ ack to p@@ ile the positions of M@@ 23 on the h@@ ills .
The Congolese President , Jose@@ p@@ h K@@ abil@@ a , once again called the rebels on Wednesday evening to &apos; voluntarily demo@@ bil@@ ate &apos; , otherwise he has left the K@@ amp@@ ala process open , in which Kin@@ sha@@ sa and M@@ 23 have been under discussion since December without any result at the moment .
On the ground , M@@ 23 political leaders hope to reach agreement .
&apos;@@ We have completed the talks , there is only the Ug@@ and@@ an mediation to organise the signature &apos; , and it has claimed Ro@@ ger Lu@@ m@@ bas@@ a , vice-@@ president of the delegation from M@@ 23 , without that information being confirmed immediately on the government side .
M@@ 23 was born of a mut@@ iny , in April 2012 , of former rebels , mostly killed , in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement .
The UN and Kin@@ sha@@ sa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M@@ 23 , which K@@ ig@@ ali and K@@ amp@@ ala refu@@ te .
North Ki@@ v@@ u is one of the most den@@ sely populated regions of the DR@@ C , and its sub@@ soil is full of co@@ ve@@ ted mineral resources .
In B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana , on the Ug@@ and@@ an side of the border , where there had been around 5@@ ,000 people between Monday and Wednesday , according to the UN , the return movement to the DR@@ C , which had started in the morning , reversed in the mid-@@ day .
&apos;@@ This morning we went back to our fields , but the military told us that we were going back &apos; , said to the A@@ F@@ P Im@@ el@@ da N@@ y@@ ir@@ an@@ k@@ u@@ si , surrounded by its nine children , including a baby on the back .
We have the impression that fire is coming closer to the people .
Ear@@ lier this evening , dozens of inhabitants were crossing the border , some with a match on their head , to spend the night in Uganda .

It is a revolution : French mu@@ si@@ cal is affir@@ med as a kind of success .
In the long run , from Bo@@ t de Paris from Paris to Mo@@ z@@ art , most of the attempts would be made in the ridiculous .
And successes such as Cab@@ ar@@ et , or the Mis@@ bles , made it a myster@@ y .
The arrival of Jean-@@ Lu@@ c Ch@@ op@@ in in Ch@@ ast@@ el@@ et and in St@@ age - En@@ ter@@ ie in Mo@@ g@@ ador has changed .
Today , both scenes are running headlines like tu@@ bes .
The first includes his excellent M@@ ary F@@ air Lad@@ y this Christmas and announced for the following world creation of an American in Paris .
In Mo@@ g@@ ador , &quot; The B@@ ose and the B@@ attle &quot; could be one of the success stories of the season .
On the other scenes , mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les like &apos; 17@@ 89 &apos; , &apos; the Bas@@ til@@ le lo@@ vers &apos; and small mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ounds such as &apos; Dis@@ co &apos; or &apos; Life and Times &apos; are proving to be successful and quality .
Pat@@ rick Ni@@ ed@@ o , author of the reference book &apos; History of mu@@ si@@ cal com@@ e@@ es &apos; and comm@@ an@@ ding the theat@@ re of Ch@@ ast@@ el@@ et , analyses the reasons for such hard-@@ won success .
How can we change the French mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ounds ?
The supply has multi@@ plied .
First of all , there are &apos; mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les &apos; which evolve as producers ...
Some use - beautiful images of images and a real history as in 17@@ 89 , Bas@@ til@@ le ’ s A@@ man@@ ts .
Others are taking a step backwards by 15 years on the pretext that one can be used almost - anything when you have Mat@@ t - Po@@ k@@ or@@ a .
After all , we have mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ounds with the s@@ om@@ p@@ ous production of Ch@@ ast@@ el@@ et , which brings us back to the Bro@@ ad@@ way golden age and to the uni@@ verse of Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ on@@ he@@ im , the largest living com@@ pos@@ er .
The use of a popul@@ arly popul@@ ari@@ ze of Ang@@ lo@@ -@@ Sa@@ xon mu@@ si@@ cal comp@@ ounds of variety by adapting them to French .
The independent French producers are trying a breakthrough .
But projects under way like &apos; R@@ est &apos; , &apos; The B@@ ai@@ is@@ er of the W@@ id@@ er Women &apos; or &apos; the E@@ ve of Spring &apos; are difficult to finance .
Do we have enough artists like Bro@@ ad@@ ways of sing@@ er , play and d@@ ance ?
In Paris , when there are eight music spectac@@ les in a season , it is a great year .
We have 200 talent artists who are turning projects into projects .
In the United States , the cra@@ dle of the mu@@ si@@ cal mix is very different .
Young people are trained to these professions in many schools .
There is a lot of jobs between the regional , tour , Bro@@ ad@@ way , off-@@ B@@ ro@@ ad@@ way , and so on .
The vi@@ vi@@ d of talent is as important as the number of jobs to be filled .
Why are the tow@@ ers in the province so successful ?
With the exception of the oper@@ a , the province remains the poor parent of culture in France .
Fe@@ w theat@@ re coins go on tour and often the theat@@ re theat@@ re for adults and not young adults .
There is a lack of mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ les .
It is the same young people who like the television and what it produces as short-@@ lived st@@ ars ...
Pro@@ posing beautiful young men ( often tal@@ ented ) at the top of a mu@@ si@@ cal spectac@@ le is the assurance that these young girls and often their entire families will be sw@@ allowed .
The Fac@@ e@@ book pages of these spectac@@ les are well known - held by professionals who answer questions .
These spectac@@ les are very expected when they arrive in a province of province .
The Ma@@ y@@ on@@ ist has been in Paris and disgu@@ ised by prov@@ in@@ cial prov@@ in@@ cial products .

A serious injury in an accident with a gh@@ o@@ st driver on Brussels selling
A road accident caused a serious w@@ ounded , on Friday morning at 5@@ 30 p.m. , on the Brussels internal house to H@@ o@@ il@@ a@@ art , to W@@ ater@@ lo@@ o .
The car of a driving force was won by a gh@@ o@@ st driver who is un@@ easy .
Re@@ placing was closed to circulation , until 9 p.m. in the accident , the time for the road to be cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident .
This situation has not , however , resulted in traffic j@@ ams , because the accident took place at the level of the Ho@@ e@@ il@@ art exit .
As a result , traffic has been removed by this exit / entry .

A child of five years has been seriously injured as a result of an accident on the attr@@ action at Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Paris .
Its vital prog@@ no@@ sis is no longer committed , but it is still hospital .
At the time of the fall , the bo@@ y was with his father on a ship of the Caribbean &apos;s attr@@ action .

DR@@ C : The army is preparing a new assault on a new assault on the army .
Children play a carbon h@@ ill that belong@@ ed to the rebels of M@@ 23 , K@@ i@@ i@@ um@@ ba , on 31 October 2013 , in the east of the DR@@ C .
The Congolese army was preparing for another attack on the last bas@@ tions of the M@@ 23 rebels near B@@ und@@ ag@@ ana in the east of the DR@@ C .
The aim is to remove the M@@ 23 from the h@@ ills that over@@ shadow B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Yesterday we took the h@@ ill in Bu@@ g@@ in@@ a , over@@ shad@@ owed by M@@ ub@@ z@@ i .
Today , M@@ bu@@ z@@ i should come down .
There will only be the R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i h@@ ill .
&quot; The C@@ ell@@ s is not very strategic , &quot; has indicated the govern@@ or of North Ki@@ v@@ u , Ju@@ kin P@@ lu@@ k@@ u .
Mr P@@ lu@@ k@@ u is planning to visit Saturday a B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans and the last strong place of the re@@ bel@@ lion , this loc@@ ality on the Ug@@ and@@ an border , to around 80 km in northern G@@ om@@ a .
It was taken on Wednesday by the Ar@@ med For@@ ces of the Democratic Republic of Congo Wednesday .
Since then , a few hundred in@@ m@@ ates of M@@ 23 have been cut to almost 2@@ ,000 metres of al@@ titude on the agricultural h@@ ills of Chancellor R@@ un@@ y@@ on@@ y@@ i and M@@ ub@@ z@@ i near B@@ un@@ ag@@ ana and the neighbouring town of J@@ om@@ a .
In J@@ om@@ a , a person who reported on the whole day of fighting on Thursday , said that the situation was &apos; calm since this morning &apos; .
According to him , a woman and her child were killed by the street fighting and buried .
A gir@@ l was w@@ ounded by bul@@ lets , and three other people were injured , including a surge , evac@@ uated by the F@@ ARC , added that witness quoted by the A@@ F@@ P .
Since the resumption of the fighting between F@@ ARC and rebels on 25 October , the two war@@ ring parties have given no assessment of the loss of human lives .
The N@@ SA ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations increase companies ’ par@@ ano@@ ia with regard to state surveillance
A fine day at the end of August , a German police hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter over@@ ran the British Con@@ federation in Frank@@ fur@@ t , Germany ’ s financial capital .
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ( B@@ f@@ V ) , the German National intelligence agency , its mission was to photo@@ grap@@ h the ro@@ of of the American van@@ post , located at less than 5 km of the European Central Bank and the B@@ und@@ es@@ bank .
The German media explain that the B@@ f@@ V hoped to identify the presence of listening an@@ ten@@ es and that the operation provoked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin .
James C@@ tig@@ er , the US intelligence director , once again insisted in September that the US does not use their foreign intelligence capabilities to “ ste@@ al the industrial secre@@ ts of foreign companies for US companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits . ”
But since Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den , the consul@@ tant who has become whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers , has begun to un@@ ra@@ vel his in@@ exha@@ usti@@ ble trea@@ sury of information about US surveillance secre@@ ts , European governments and business leaders no longer know whether the director should think about it .
Re@@ ports that the National Security Agency has sp@@ illed Brazil ’ s oil company Pe@@ tro@@ br@@ as and had access to data held by US storage service providers in the C@@ l@@ ent , including Google and Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have more than ever ar@@ oused business par@@ ano@@ ia with state surveillance .
The re@@ vel@@ ation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s tele@@ phones had been pir@@ ated , perhaps even for a decade , was the drop in the ocean .
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted , then corporate leaders are surely also potential targets .
S@@ now@@ den made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and businesses transparent .
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for their mutual benefit .
“ Germany must wake up , ” declare O@@ li@@ ver Gr@@ ü@@ n , President of B@@ IT@@ M@@ i , representing German SMEs in the IT sector .
German companies believe that the US is such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial es@@ pion@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to an inquiry published in July by the E@@ Y Office .
However , in all the documents revealed by Mr S@@ now@@ den , there is no indication to date that the United States has passed industrial secre@@ ts from foreign companies to American companies .
Poli@@ tici@@ ans have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States .
Corpor@@ ate leaders are skep@@ tical about this .
A German Parliament Member says that we should create a German Google .
I can only turn a blind eye and reopen them slowly ...
&apos;@@ This is not the right way to go &apos; , it indicates H@@ ass@@ o Pl@@ att@@ ner , Chairman of the German company software company , SA@@ P .
If we wanted a strong European IT industry , then we should not let it die 20 years ago .
Everything is subsidised in Germany , from coal to cars , to farmers .
Everything except the IT industry .
Yet the extent and sophistic@@ ation of US es@@ pion@@ age agencies exposed by S@@ now@@ den ’ s re@@ vel@@ ations was a shock for some companies that believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance .
A major change is taking place in cl@@ oud computers , as European officials have realised that the data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable .
According to a survey by the C@@ l@@ ent Security Alliance , a professional body , some 10 % of non-@@ American members have abandoned their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cl@@ oud after re@@ vel@@ ations about the P@@ ris@@ m data expl@@ oration programme .
J@@ im S@@ n@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ director of SA@@ P , says : &apos; Our customers are asking us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago : where is my data retained and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction ? &apos;
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew , namely that the powerful states want to fly their most precious secre@@ ts and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs .
It is no surprise that there is economic es@@ pion@@ age .
There has always been a case in point .
&apos;@@ This has been a recur@@ ring theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion &apos; , says Kur@@ t Bo@@ c@@ k , Director General of the B@@ AS@@ F chemicals company .
Americans are sp@@ ying us in commercial and industrial terms just as we sp@@ y them , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
En@@ treprene@@ urship leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place , if that would leave the advantage of an ad@@ versary .
Lar@@ ge companies have long been making the message that it is un@@ wise to recover a free US@@ B key at a professional sal@@ on or to leave a mobile computer without supervision in a ho@@ tel room .
Ul@@ rich H@@ ac@@ k@@ enberg , a member of the management board of the Au@@ di car manufacturer , says that the collection of mobile phones before Council meetings , so that they cannot be used as a distance vehicle , has been common practice for years .
Germany ’ s B@@ f@@ V is advis@@ ing its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones that are pre@@ paid when they travel abroad because of the risk of damage to the integrity of the Mar@@ t@@ ph@@ one .
Pre@@ paid mobile phones are then thrown off .
However , it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance .
In Germany , many SMEs are world leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&apos; SMEs often lack experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access &apos; , warn the B@@ f@@ V in a report .
The United States is warning their own companies about the economic es@@ pion@@ age activities carried out by other countries .
The US National Int@@ elli@@ gence ( N@@ I@@ E ) made in February by the United States cited France , as did Russia and Israel , which were guilty of carrying out acts of economic intelligence , behind China , according to the Washington Po@@ st .
A member of the board of a re@@ now@@ ned German company believed that when it comes to economic es@@ pion@@ age , &quot; the French are the worst &quot; .
Ber@@ n@@ ard S@@ for@@ c@@ i , a former French domestic intelligence director , D@@ PR@@ I , said in a interview this month : “ The services know perfectly well that all countries , even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism , sp@@ y their allies . ”
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia , who died in un@@ told circumstances , believe that their son was murdered murdered .
The parents of a teen@@ ag@@ er in Georgia , whose body was found in a car@@ pet in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se of his school , think that their son was murdered , declared the family lawyer on Thursday .
K@@ end@@ rick Joh@@ n@@ son , from Val@@ do@@ sta in Georgia , was found on 11 January stuck in a sustained car@@ pet behind the gr@@ ud@@ ges of the gy@@ m@@ na@@ se of his school .
The S@@ her@@ ff investig@@ ators in the L@@ ow@@ n@@ des Com@@ t concluded that Joh@@ n@@ son died in un@@ told circumstances , but the family of the seven@@ teen@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y contest these conclusions .
&apos;@@ They are absolutely certain that their son has been murdered &apos; , said Ben@@ j@@ am@@ in C@@ ru@@ m@@ p , the lawyer representing Ken@@ ne@@ th and J@@ ac@@ le@@ y@@ n Joh@@ n@@ son , on Fo@@ x@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
They never thought that he was dead as it was indicated in the conclusions of the sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff .
“ They believe that this beg@@ g@@ ars belief , the laws of physi@@ cs and common sense , ” added C@@ ru@@ m@@ p .
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the people responsible for the death of their son .
“ They sent their s@@ ons to school with a car@@ table , and they made it in a deadly ba@@ g , ” he added .
The US prosecutor Mic@@ hael Mo@@ ore declared on Thursday that he conducted an official investigation into Joh@@ n@@ son &apos;s death , pointing out that several important issues remained un@@ answered .
What is the cause of death ?
Is his death the result of a criminal act ?
Mo@@ ore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .
I will follow up the facts wherever they lead .
My aim is to discover the truth .
&apos;@@ I think there is a sufficient basis &apos; to open an official inquiry .
Mo@@ ore told journalists that the first au@@ top@@ sy said that Joh@@ n@@ son was dead by “ posi@@ tional suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
However , a second au@@ top@@ sy identified another cause of death , according to Mo@@ ore .
&apos;@@ A number of questions still deserve a response or confirmation &apos; .
Mo@@ ore added that if he up@@ dates elements that justify a civil or criminal investigation into Joh@@ n@@ son ’ s death , he will ask the F@@ B@@ I to lead it .
The representative of the S@@ her@@ f office of L@@ ow@@ n@@ des was not available to give us his opinion when we cont@@ acted him on Thursday .
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video record@@ ings that the investig@@ ators had examined .
The parents of teen@@ ag@@ er said they hoped that video images would contain evidence of the circumstances of his death .
The C@@ C publ@@ ishes advice on aller@@ gies in children to schools to schools
On Wednesday , the US Centre for Dis@@ ease Prevention and Prevention published a series of directives showing how to manage children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publ@@ ishes , since the number of children in school age suffering from food aller@@ gies has so@@ ared .
One in 20 children in the United States is now suffering from food aller@@ gies .
The CD@@ C found that the pre@@ valence of food aller@@ gies in the child had increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the body and staff to food aller@@ gies in children and how to deal with them in the event of aller@@ gic reactions .
It also recommends that schools should have a v@@ as@@ p@@ ine stock – as E@@ pi@@ en ’ s self-@@ ed@@ itor is most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially leth@@ al an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ x@@ ia .
The legislative assemb@@ lies of the Member States have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have more easily the v@@ amp@@ ine in stock .
The report also includes a list of the typical symptoms communicated by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
Children can say , &apos; I get the impression that something gets me the language &apos; , &apos; I get the impression that I have a horse on the language &apos; or &apos; I have pi@@ co@@ ts on language &apos; .
The N@@ SA case underlines the total absence of a debate on intelligence .
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government , which is off@@ ended in public by conven@@ ing the United States ambassador on 21 October , and on the other banning the flight of the territory by the Boli@@ vian presidential plane , on the basis of the rum@@ our of the presence on his board of Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den ?
In my opinion , there are two levels of response from the French Government .
When Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is Hol@@ lan@@ de phone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister L@@ au@@ rent Fab@@ i@@ us con@@ tests the US ambassador , they respond to a real discovery , which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France .
Is it not surprising to read in the col@@ um@@ ns of the Mon@@ de just a few weeks away from the reproduction of American diplomatic correspon@@ dence and , on the other hand , a condemnation of the listening to the N@@ SA by the N@@ SA ?
Would it not be like a vague hypocrisy on your part ?
journ@@ alistic action is not a moral posi@@ tioning , but the search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to form an opinion .
When Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks lift the ve@@ il over American diplomacy ’ s analysis of political or other challenges around the world , we believe that , in view of American power , this is an important lighting .
When we describe the US inter@@ c@@ eption systems against French diplomacy in the United States , it is by no means to be indign@@ ant about this practice , it is to describe the world as it is .
Has France received information from the N@@ SA about terrorist operations aimed at our interests ?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation ?
The establishment of highly powerful technological tools for inter@@ c@@ eption by the US , but also by France , has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism .
Moreover , in this area , France and the United States , in particular , have established almost daily procedures for cooperation and exchange of information , which are described on both sides as essential .
For example , the presence of Mo@@ ham@@ med Mer@@ ah in the tri@@ bal areas in M@@ ir@@ an@@ sh@@ ah was reported to the French through the means of the N@@ SA .
France can be led , for example , to trans@@ mit whole blocks of data on the Sa@@ hel region to American services , and in return - as has already been said - the Americans can provide information to the French on other parts of the world .
So the underlying question behind this N@@ SA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with inter@@ c@@ eption tools , but the question of the total absence of prior debate , particularly in parliaments , on the justification for such systems , the per@@ im@@ e@@ ter that must be the@@ irs and , ultimately , the question of violations of freedoms .
What is the real risk of the US ?
They may be denounced , I do not see how they can be punished .
The risk that the Americans run may be two@@ fold .
The first is when their allies – and this was the case recently – learn that their leaders , sometimes at the top summit in their state , were monitored .
This is the case with Brazil and Germany , two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been stra@@ ined .
Another effect may be more economic : more and more European or South American companies are reluctant , in the light of re@@ vel@@ ations , to entr@@ ust their confidential data to American suppliers subject to US laws , and thus to the grip of the N@@ SA .
Last but not least , the vast movement of re@@ vel@@ ations undertaken by media around the world , which helps to initiate a debate on the virtually non-existent supervisory practices of intelligence services , could push legislators , including American legislators , to reconsider the powers they have given their intelligence services .
Pa@@ rents of sex children can choose &apos; un@@ determined sex &apos; .
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sexual organs .
The male or female sex of the new@@ born born will no longer be allocated to them rigid at birth .
Under the new law , parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child , allowing them to inser@@ t an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; sex on their birth certificate .
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could take ha@@ sty decisions about a sur@@ ger@@ y of sexual sexual re@@ orientation for their babies , and to fight against discrimination against people who are sex .
According to the B@@ BC , an sex person would have said years later , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”
I will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work that doctors have created , con@@ tu@@ ached and wi@@ ped out .
It is estimated that a child in 2 000 born every year is neither a bo@@ y nor a daughter .
They are sexual , the inter@@ sex@@ u@@ ality forms part of the group of 60 diseases diagno@@ sed as a disorder of sexual development , a generic term nam@@ ing people with ch@@ ro@@ o@@ os@@ om@@ es or bo@@ xes ( o@@ vari@@ s or t@@ ab@@ lets ) at@@ yp@@ ical or ab@@ normally developed .
Wallis S@@ imp@@ son could have been sex@@ ually inter@@ sex@@ ed .
sexual identification is still not well understood , but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined , it is better to use the best information available to award it , then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a sur@@ gical act , if necessary .
Dr J@@ ack D@@ res@@ cher , a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t in New York and specialist on sexual identification issues , said that the new German law “ seems a good idea . ”
Children ’ s children are an ethical dilemma .
&apos;@@ Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases which require a sur@@ gical act , but this is not the case for most children &apos; .
It is possible to take sexual arrest without operation and see how identity develops .
The science of how a child develops a sexual identity is not very precise .
No one can answer the question as to why this is happening .
It is like the myster@@ y that surr@@ ounds homosexual people .
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described sex people as different from trans@@ gender or trans@@ gender persons , since their status is not linked to gender but rather to their biological constitution , which is not exclusively that of a man or a woman alone , but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either .
These characteristics can be manife@@ sted for themselves in secondary sexual characteristics ( such as mus@@ cul@@ ar mass , pil@@ otage , pe@@ t@@ t@@ les , and stat@@ ure ) , primary sex characteristics ( such as reproductive organs and sexual organs ) or the structure of ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ om@@ es and hormones .
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by sex and trans@@ gender people in the field of employment , as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice .
Young men of non-@@ compli@@ ant kind now have camps which are specifically intended for them .
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male , female , or third-@@ sex sex on their official documents .
In June , an Austr@@ ali@@ an of 52 years , Nor@@ e May@@ -@@ W@@ el@@ by , became the first person in the world to have been recognised “ neutral ” after winning his appeal trial that allows him to retain an “ un@@ specified ” sex for life .
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for inter@@ sex@@ é , according to the Interior Ministry .
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , according to a broadcast broadcast on France 24 .
In 2011 , dozens of law@@ -@@ makers in that Catholic country signed a petition for “ gender theory ” to be removed from school books .
The American website Ca@@ thol@@ ic On@@ line has also opposed German law , writ@@ ing that “ since the world is dra@@ gged into a new rule where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one , two other pillars of civilisation are over@@ turned . ”
In Mar@@ y@@ land , the mother of a baby also said on B@@ ab@@ y Z@@ one that she would prefer a sex to be given to babies at their birth .
&apos;@@ The role of parent is sufficiently st@@ agg@@ ering without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your child &apos; , she said on the site for young parents .
Children need stability and certainty .
His@@ tor@@ ically , children born without male or female sexual organs were called her@@ ma@@ ro@@ ro@@ ts , according to the name of the beautiful Greek God who had double gender .
And only a decade ago , the medical community regarded gender as an ar@@ do@@ y , which can be wi@@ ped out and on which one can re@@ design .
But now there are many who call into question the ethical basis of sur@@ ger@@ y , knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can make mistakes , without knowing how a child will feel sexual reg@@ en@@ eration when it grows .
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , this was called a psy@@ chi@@ atric emergency . ”
When these children were born , they were not called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , they were tele@@ ph@@ oned .
The dominant theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Mon@@ ey , the University of Joh@@ n@@ s-@@ H@@ op@@ k@@ ins , who considered the gender to be m@@ alle@@ able .
He dedicated the term “ sexual identity ” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – inter@@ act with a child ’ s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female sex .
But in a case of 196@@ 6 , known as “ John / Jo@@ an , ” his the@@ ories gave rise to controversy .
He had advised the parents of a small bo@@ y who had been cut off in a bot@@ ched circum@@ c@@ ision to make him completely c@@ rown , taking him away from the head@@ scar@@ ves too , and raising him like a daughter .
“ Mon@@ ey presented this as a successful transitional case , but it was not . ”
At the age of about 15 , he became a bo@@ y and married with a woman .
But , at 38 years , he committed suicide .
D@@ res@@ her said that some doctors &apos; always repeat this model &apos; .
But in the 1990 &apos;s , with the arrival of the Internet , those who survived these gender@@ -@@ change operations say that they are not satisfied with the result .
This is the case of J@@ im B@@ ru@@ ce , a 36 year-old writ@@ er in Mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with male X@@ Y ch@@ ro@@ m@@ os@@ es but ambiguous sexual organs .
Do@@ c@@ tors could not really say if he had a large cli@@ or@@ is or a little ar@@ ts and was convinced that he could never have a &apos; satisfactory life &apos; as a man .
So shortly after his birth in 197@@ 6 , B@@ ru@@ ce suffered a sur@@ gical ab@@ rog@@ ation of the external body and the t@@ es@@ k@@ les and was high as a daughter .
He was given female hormones at the age of 12 .
“ I knew I was not a daughter , ” he said on A@@ B@@ C@@ New@@ s@@ .@@ com@@ .
I was not happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
At 18 years , he suffered a v@@ int@@ age .
But de@@ pressed and realised that something was not going , he asked for his medical dossier .
What he discovered was horri@@ fied by what he discovered .
I was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth – and no one had ever told me .
B@@ ru@@ ce was born with a dis@@ array of sexual development ( D@@ D@@ S ) , which prevented its body from producing enough tests for its sexual organs to develop .
After learning the truth , he became a man , following a treatment to the te@@ to@@ ster@@ r@@ one and got away from the pigs .
The sur@@ ger@@ y made it ster@@ ile .
Today , he defends the cause of others in an organisation called Inter@@ face Pro@@ ject , which is trying to norm@@ alise the perception of people who are sex .
But An@@ ne Tam@@ ar@@ -@@ M@@ at@@ is , the Director-General of the non-@@ profit@@ -making organization based in California Ad@@ voc@@ ate Cha@@ ce , fears that German law “ calls for labelling and stig@@ ma@@ tisation . ”
&apos;@@ Many activists worry that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their children an &apos; un@@ specified &apos; sex , and has said so .
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention .
We think it would be better to allocate male or female sex and wait .
But we did not see what the law would give , so we can only make assumptions .
Tam@@ il M@@ at@@ ti@@ s said that his organisation supported Austr@@ ali@@ an law because “ it allows adults to choose to be recognised as the third sex . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions on a legal type , ” she added .
German law concerns the allocation of gender to birth .
This is not a battle that young children should lead to that age .
When they grow , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
But Dr Ar@@ len@@ e Bar@@ at@@ z , a speci@@ alized radio scienti@@ st in Pit@@ t@@ s@@ burgh , whose daughter has a disorder of sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group , said that German law will “ responsibility ” for parents and children .
The daughter of Dr Bar@@ at@@ z , K@@ ony , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ m@@ os@@ es , but suffers from a D@@ D@@ S known as full in@@ sensitivity syn@@ dro@@ me to an@@ d@@ ants .
As a result of the failure of its anc@@ ill@@ ary recei@@ vers , K@@ ony developed female characteristics .
It has a v@@ in , but no cer@@ vic@@ us or o@@ vens .
Now , in the age of 29 , K@@ ony is married and internal in children &apos;s psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry at Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania University .
Although it is ster@@ ile , it hopes to have children through adoption services or parent mothers .
&apos;@@ The law gives parents some lee@@ way so that they do not have to take ha@@ sty decisions &apos; .
This gives them time to carry out certain tests and understand them , and a time limit before they inser@@ t &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female &apos; .
So everything goes well – you can raise your child and love it .
You have a wonderful baby and take advantage of the pleasure of being parent .
You do not have to rush to a sur@@ gical intervention that is irreversible .
&apos;@@ It puts children at the heart of the decision and less@@ ens the feeling of anxiety that motiv@@ ates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is needed &apos; .
Finally , the child will decide what sex he / she feels the most at home – and that is something wonderful .
This allows the child to take the decision for himself .
L@@ et@@ ta confident in the long@@ ev@@ ity of his government
Italian Council President En@@ ric@@ o L@@ et@@ ta believes that his government will keep up until 2015 , despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote for the removal of Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi from his mandate .
In a daily interview La Sta@@ mp@@ a , the cen@@ ter-@@ left leader said that he had “ strong intent ” to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015 .
The Italian Parliament &apos;s upper house will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former Council President convicted of tax fraud in August .
Sil@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate , where he has more opponents than supporters , declared his removal .
But part of its camp , grou@@ ped around the National Secretary of Freedom ( P@@ D@@ L ) Ang@@ el@@ ino Al@@ f@@ ano , continues to support the government , as demonstrated on 2 October by its refusal to give in to Berlusconi ’ s orders , which already wanted to bring down the cabinet .
The L@@ .@@ A@@ . Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Safety Agency , T@@ SA , and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire .
Rap@@ id fire fighters have said that they have responded to a call of &apos; multiple injuries &apos; .
&apos;@@ The forces of order are on the spot &apos; , specifying the airport on its T@@ wit@@ ter account , while the television pictures showed people evac@@ uated in am@@ bul@@ ances .
&apos;@@ There was a sho@@ oting &apos; , said to the A@@ F@@ P a spokesman for the US Transport Safety Agency ( T@@ SA ) .
A@@ BC &apos;s local an@@ ten@@ er showed a person evac@@ uated on a t@@ ank , and a second transported on a whe@@ el@@ chair .
The incident took place at 9.@@ 30 local ( 12.@@ 30 p.m. in Mon@@ tre@@ al ) at ter@@ minal 3 at the airport .
The L@@ os Ang@@ el@@ es Times states that t@@ emo@@ s 2 and 3 are being evac@@ uated .
The spokesman for the T@@ SA was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured .
All flights at the arrival and departure of the airport have been suspended .
The Israeli army k@@ ills a member of Hamas in Gaz@@ a-@@ s@@ ong@@ s in Gaz@@ a-@@ s@@ these .
Israeli tanks killed an Islamist Palestinian milit@@ ant on Thursday , and severely injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip , and were taught after sources of health services .
A source from Hamas has explained that fighting has erup@@ ted in that region , because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mor@@ als .
The Israeli army simply referred to &apos; targeted action &apos; in the area close to a &apos; terrorist &apos; tunnel by the Jewish state , which was spread at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-@@ October .
The report .
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advis@@ ors have , in the greatest secret , considered replacing Vice-President Jo@@ e B@@ id@@ en by H@@ ill@@ ary Clinton on the 2012 list , according to the New York Times .
This re@@ vel@@ ation is the most striking event in the much-@@ anticipated book of Mar@@ k Hal@@ per@@ in and John He@@ il@@ an@@ n ’ s 2012 campaign , “ D@@ able D@@ ow@@ n : G@@ ame Ch@@ ange 2012 . ”
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday evening that the President ’ s close collabor@@ ators had carried out “ in-depth work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 ” to see whether B@@ id@@ en ’ s ev@@ ic@@ tion could help Obama to re-@@ election when his hopes fell .
According to the political correspon@@ dent of the J@@ on@@ a@@ than Martin Times , the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials in the campaign and the White House , namely the former Secretary General of the White House Bill D@@ ill D@@ e@@ e@@ y , to assess what effect the former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot .
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fier@@ cely retained in the Chic@@ ago campaign in Chic@@ ago and within the o@@ val Bureau .
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s close advisers – including D@@ e@@ e@@ y , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , J@@ im Mess@@ ina , and the former coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors on the White House David A@@ x@@ el@@ ro@@ d and David P@@ l@@ ell@@ e – knew that change was under way .
“ D@@ able D@@ ow@@ n ” indicates that D@@ e@@ e@@ y led the charge to replace B@@ id@@ en , despite their “ close personal ties , ” before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that Clinton on the presidential list “ did not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances of success . ”
In an interview with Martin , D@@ e@@ e@@ y confirmed that the administration did indeed consider replacing B@@ id@@ en by Clinton .
&apos;@@ I said that I had examined a whole series of questions , and that was one of them &apos; , and said D@@ e@@ e@@ y to the newspaper .
Rem@@ ember that at that time the President was not in form , and so it was said , &apos; Lord , what can we do ? &apos;
While D@@ e@@ e@@ y described “ concer@@ t ” as “ concerted , ” Martin indicated to Ander@@ son Co@@ op@@ er de C@@ N@@ N that the re-@@ election campaign had invested much to discover whether change would be beneficial during the election .
&apos;@@ The campaigns do not devote a lot of money to polls and discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action &apos; , and said Martin on AC@@ 3@@ 60 .
However , it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was looking at replacement .
Martin said on C@@ N@@ N that he asked D@@ e@@ e@@ y whether his bos@@ s was aware of the possible overhaul .
Although D@@ e@@ e@@ y said that he did not think the President “ knew ” about possible change , the former Secretary-General admitted that he was “ possible ” that Obama knew .
Martin added that “ D@@ able D@@ ow@@ n ” did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had reached Obama ’ s office .
Co@@ op@@ er asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that B@@ id@@ en ’ s removal from the presidential list was examined .
&apos;@@ Perhaps &apos; , &apos; perhaps &apos; , replied to Martin .
Do you want a flu@@ o ice ?
A British entreprene@@ ur has created the first flu@@ or@@ ising ice in the world .
Char@@ lie Franc@@ is has taken advantage of the flu@@ or@@ inated properties of this marine animal to develop a lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous col@@ lation .
He had the idea after reading a study on the mis@@ fortun@@ es and convinced Chinese scientists to rec@@ reate chem@@ ically the brilliant protein .
The ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the language by increasing the p@@ H of the protein to make it brilliant .
Ch@@ ris explains that , because the ice cre@@ am starts to read when it re@@ acts to the heat of the m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece , the more it s@@ its , the more brilliant it becomes .
Char@@ lie , the foun@@ der of the ice society ‘ L@@ ick M@@ e I@@ m De@@ li@@ ci@@ us ’ , said : ‘ This is something incredible , but we are still in the beginning in terms of production , and 2 g of that cost costs around 200 p@@ ounds . ’
The protein we use in ice re@@ acts with the neutral p@@ H language .
So when your m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece warm up the protein , the p@@ H level is rising , and the ice is b@@ lowing .
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all at the time of H@@ all@@ we@@ en , because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect .
This is probably the most expensive ice I have created , because the me@@ als are four times more expensive than gold .
So every slu@@ dge costs me about 140 p@@ ounds .
But it has a rather good taste for it !
The company with the experimental approach of Char@@ lie , based in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , is known for its unusual ice per@@ f@@ umes such as beer , che@@ ese , beef , and the gold Ma@@ p .
But its next creation is even more ambitious .
He added : “ I really would like to develop an in@@ visible ice . ”
This is intr@@ insi@@ cally impossible because of the re@@ plic@@ ation caused by ice cryst@@ als that form the ice cre@@ am , but I think I will find a way to do that .
The ice uses the flu@@ or@@ o@@ res@@ e properties of the syn@@ the@@ tic mis@@ represented by Chinese scientists .

The arti@@ st died last Sunday at the age of 71 .
&apos;@@ He died on Sunday morning , when he looked at the trees and carried out the famous 21st t@@ ab@@ i movement , with his hands of mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans flying the air &apos; , wrote L@@ au@@ ri@@ e Ander@@ son .

The wife &apos;s wife also explains that she promised his hus@@ band , the week before his death , to get him out of the hospital and take him to their homes in S@@ pr@@ ings ( L@@ ong Is@@ land ) .
L@@ ou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years .
And even if we are urban , it is our spiritual house .
&apos;@@ L@@ ou was a pr@@ ince and a figh@@ ter , and I know that his s@@ ong@@ s about the pain and beau@@ ty of the world will pass on to many people the wonderful joy of life &apos; .

When I was a little , H@@ all@@ we@@ an was magic .
My s@@ ister and I were allowed to eat swee@@ ts , go late and disgu@@ ise us to go into the neighbourhood .
Today , I have become more po@@ ign@@ ant .
In the last two years I have not distributed a single bon@@ us and I will certainly not do so this year .
But the st@@ ars show that I am the black sheep when we talk about H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
The majority of Americans – 15@@ 8 million of them in fact – will be celebrating H@@ all@@ we@@ an this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 trillion in bon@@ uses , disgu@@ is@@ ings , and dec@@ or@@ ations , according to the National Re@@ al Federation .
What I look forward to is the trend of every H@@ all@@ we@@ an cele@@ bra@@ tions .
S@@ ho@@ ff@@ ers should represent $ 1.2 million of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
This year , in@@ anim@@ ated sex@@ y objects are fu@@ rious .
Women no longer need to be sex@@ y workers ; they can also be sex@@ y foods like p@@ iz@@ z@@ as , ham@@ bur@@ ers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , thanks to the T@@ king De@@ ad series , and I be@@ t that the men in the D@@ able P@@ un@@ k area will be among our photo@@ s In@@ stag@@ ra@@ m this year .
According to Google , the most sought disgu@@ ise is z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , B@@ at@@ man , pir@@ ates , and wit@@ ches .
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional .
We disgu@@ ised our dogs last year and , to my aston@@ ishment , they were not the only ones .
In fact , Americans are going to spend $ 3@@ 30 in animal disgu@@ ise this year , according to the N@@ R@@ F .
It has many curious dogs disgu@@ ised in ho@@ o@@ ks .
When it comes to swee@@ ts , we do not sh@@ y away .
Americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 trillion on bon@@ uses this year , according to the Ni@@ el@@ sen cabinet .
This represents about 27@@ 2 million k@@ g of Her@@ sh@@ ey , summary , Mil@@ k Du@@ ds , T@@ wi@@ zz@@ l@@ ers and bar@@ res C@@ lar@@ k .
It is a super-@@ news for the 41 million children who are going to the hun@@ ts in their neighbourhood , according to the US Department of Trade .
In fact , we are going to buy and , let us not tell stories , consume 41 million k@@ g of chocolate during H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
Good maize is the only thing that we do not want to eat ; yet almost 16 million k@@ g is sold for Her@@ we@@ we@@ en , according to the National Consumer Association .
This is about 9 billion maize grain .
It is a myster@@ y that I have not yet managed to clarify .
Nothing is more representative of H@@ all@@ we@@ in than the houses .

Ro@@ yal Bank of Scot@@ t@@ land will create an internal de@@ vice ( “ bas@@ k bank ” ) , containing £ 38 billion ( $ 45 billion ) of the most risky assets , a measure aimed at rela@@ xing its relations with London and accelerating its re@@ privatization .
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55 % to 70 % in the next two years and hopes to have clean@@ ed it completely within three years .
R@@ B@@ S also said that it would include a provision for depreci@@ ation of additional dubious debts from four to £ 4@@ .5 billion in the quarter , a writing linked to the building structure .
R@@ B@@ S also made it clear that this internal restructuring would release £ 10@@ -@@ 11 billion of capital , thereby strengthening its ability to lend .
The bank and London have pointed out that the &apos; bas@@ k bank &apos; would help to draw a line from the past , with the government in particular accused of interfering in R@@ B@@ S management .
&apos;@@ We can now move forward , concern ourselves with the future and the 90 % of the assets that constitute a truly good bank and build a large customer for customers and the United Kingdom &apos; , said the new Director General Ros@@ s Mc@@ E@@ wan to the press .

It was postponed three days later by a person who promoted his dog stuck in the career career .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ade took the c@@ lif@@ f back to the c@@ lif@@ f and saved it from a certain death .
A chi@@ ot had the chance to escape the worst after the fire fire was called on to recover it safely when he was killed at 15 m above the soil on the unstable season of a c@@ lif@@ f .
Ru@@ by , a 9 months co@@ ol@@ er , escap@@ ed after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday .
His owners , S@@ cot@@ t Al@@ der@@ son , 25 years , and his small Bec@@ ky H@@ all , 20 years , went to the F@@ l@@ ap@@ it career in D@@ en@@ ol@@ me , West Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to return to Ru@@ by and thank the W@@ est Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire fire and rescue service .

T@@ ow@@ ards 14@@ .@@ 15 on Wednesday , a need@@ led person who promoted his dog re@@ pen@@ ted Ru@@ by on a cor@@ ni@@ che in career , stuck at 15 m above the ground .
A technical rescue team from the C@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fire bar@@ r@@ acks went to the scene and took a reminder to save Ru@@ by by using a animal animal to transport it to the top of the c@@ lif@@ f .
The technical rescue expert An@@ dy C@@ la@@ y@@ ton said : “ It was in a precarious situation . ”
It was in the middle of the c@@ lif@@ f , 15 m of the summit and 15 .
She did not move during the rescue – it was frozen .
But it is going well now .
She eating b@@ is@@ cu@@ its after .
That was a very unusual call .
It is incredible that someone noticed the dog .
The technical rescue expert Peter L@@ u said : &apos; R@@ é@@ by had a great deal of chance of getting out of it . &apos;
It could have been seriously injured or worse .
Ru@@ by has been conducted in the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian for monitoring ; his general state was satisfactory , apart from exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .

First of all , I did not think it was there .
It was surprising to have it again .
The ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian said that if it had been too exhausted and had disappeared , it would probably fall .
The fire bri@@ g@@ ades were f@@ altering .
What they did was really courageous .
They are so grateful , each of them has been absolutely wonderful .

Beijing is calling into question a Turk@@ ish-@@ led Islamic movement
&apos;@@ The support behind the scenes for the attack came from the Islamic Tur@@ ke@@ stan Movement based in Central and Western Asia &apos; , declared the bos@@ s of the Chinese security bodies at a television station in Hong Kong , according to a video online on Thursday evening on an Internet site .
Men@@ g Ji@@ an@@ z@@ h@@ u , who is a member of the Communist Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party ( CC@@ P ) , was speaking in T@@ ash@@ k@@ ent during an official visit to Uzbekistan .
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a special organization after the attack on Monday .
According to the Chinese police , three U@@ y@@ gh@@ urs of the same family from X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , a border of several Central Asian countries , ha@@ st@@ en their car with g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine against the entry of the City banned in Beijing , in a suicide attack that killed two dead and 40 injured .
The driver of the car , his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car .
The E@@ ti@@ m , which claims to fight for the independence of East Tur@@ ke@@ stan , the former name of China ’ s X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , was classified by the UN in 2002 among Al Qaeda organisations .
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the s@@ por@@ ad@@ ic disorder in X@@ in@@ ji@@ ang , but its real influence is questioned by several experts .
George K@@ er@@ ev@@ an : the break@@ -up of Europe gives the S@@ co@@ ts choice
Another day , another worrying story of independence .
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement area in order to be able to join the EU .
Now we hear stories of passport control in Ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wi@@ re border along the H@@ ad@@ ni wall .
While it is true that the Ro@@ ath@@ c@@ y@@ de newspaper has indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe , it was not in the headlines ( and it was to be predicted ) .
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States devote much of their time to circum@@ ven@@ ting their formal rules when it suits them .
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the S@@ co@@ ts .
So it is a story that is not one of them .
And a history that is so old that it is now being established : I heard for the first time the b@@ ob@@ ard that “ independence means passport control ” over 40 years ago .
However , one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old d@@ ust f@@ ever .
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe , in fact ?
Why exchange the y@@ o@@ ke from London against Brussels , especially now ?
This is the real news about Europe : the great post-war plan to uni@@ fy Europe is finally st@@ alled .
With the euro crisis , the Pro@@ ject Europe is officially dead .
Throughout Europe , the parties that oppose the EU or who are campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
Even in Germany , Germany ’ s Al@@ ter@@ native Al@@ ter@@ native Party , founded only this year and arrived from nowhere , gathered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and brought the Liberal Democratic Party ( equivalent to our Liberal Democrats ) of the B@@ unde@@ sta@@ g .
There has always been a national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe .
However , the current economic crisis has marked a turning point .
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the stra@@ it@@ jac@@ ket on national economies through accession to the single currency , has led many people to believe that the Pro@@ ject Europe has gone too far .
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – that was only true of Greece .
Instead , the European system has put its members of exchange rates fav@@ orable to German exporters – something that German politicians want to retain .
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency , the countries of southern Europe are finding themselves with an intr@@ in@@ sic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany .
The only option is to make drastic cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper un@@ ease linked to productivity in Europe .
Following the “ green ” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidi@@ ze French and German energy companies at consumer expense – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US .
This is a cost draw@@ back in terms of costs , as we have already seen in Gr@@ ang@@ em@@ outh .
Not all wages in the world will prevent the European pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry from being penalised by cheap American sh@@ ale gas .
As a result , the revol@@ t , particularly in France , is one of the EU &apos;s leading leaders .
After the war , the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington .
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe , leaving the French economy to w@@ ash .
As a result , Mar@@ ine Le Pen ’ s right-wing party , the anti-@@ European National Front , has just won a crucial partial election , sending the Socialists to power in the third place .
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left .
What does Mar@@ ine Le Pen do with his new popularity at the French white class ?
It wants to use next year &apos;s European elections to create a single and anti-@@ European anti-@@ currency bloc in the European Parliament .
If the anti-@@ European parties are good at these elections , which is very possible , such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time .
That is what I think : very soon , anti-@@ European and anti-@@ currency sentiment in Europe will unite and eventually kill the euro .
The EU will not disappear , but it will return to something that will resemb@@ le the “ Europe of Nations ( sovereign ) , ” General de Gaul@@ le .
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro , but France and southern Europe will regain their own currencies .
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project , and I hope that it will look into the United States .
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic .
And Scotland , in all of this , is Scotland in all this ?
We can decide to be a region of small England ( essentially ) .
Or we can defend our own economic interests , which includes sending out Berlin and Brussels .
I believe that Scotland could live with a fre@@ er European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency .
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Europe of non-@@ federal Nations .
Otherwise we should im@@ it@@ ate Norway and maintain our economic independence .
Scotland ’ s S@@ N@@ P government is – and should be noted – the most successful anti-@@ austerity movement in Europe , since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed cuts ( and implemented ) by the Labour Chancellor , A@@ is@@ ta@@ r Dar@@ ling , and the subsequent conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition .
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .

Should a mother be concerned if his daughter ’ s s@@ ins and pun@@ ish@@ ments begin to grow at 7 or 8 years ?
At the American A@@ ca@@ demic A@@ ca@@ de@@ my of Pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ ics this week in Or@@ lan@@ do , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , Dr Paul K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z , child en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ists , explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young American people and represent a new standard .
“ I spend a great deal of time reassuring parents – in general , that does not indicate a rapid development toward full pu@@ ri@@ tis , ” K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z said .
The obvious signs of development , such as the pu@@ ri@@ fication of se@@ ats , the po@@ inter@@ s , and the pu@@ n area and body sm@@ ell@@ s , appear earlier among girls .
But there was only a slight advance in the age of the first rules in the last four decades .
In the United States , the average age is 12 and a half years , while it was 12 years in 1970 .
“ Once the sp@@ ill began to develop , it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appeared , ” said K@@ a@@ men@@ ow@@ it@@ z , also the author of the “ El@@ ly P@@ u@@ ber@@ ty in G@@ ir@@ les : The Es@@ s@@ ential Gu@@ ide to C@@ op@@ yright . ”
Time is the most accurate test of how the pu@@ ber@@ ry will evolve .
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of the pu@@ ber@@ ty , but it is seen as &apos; early &apos; when the development of the t@@ ank is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 .
In most cases , development s@@ lows or stops – that is something that a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ ian can follow closely .
More rapid development can justify tests carried out by en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ists to remove serious problems like tu@@ m@@ ours or k@@ y@@ sts .
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and to prevent other consequences : premature ageing of the genes that can curb growth and a small size at ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
The recommendations on medical and hormon@@ al treatment are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .
The psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
K@@ a@@ ap@@ ow@@ it@@ z is cautious with medicines , but recognises that “ control of pu@@ ber@@ ry can mitigate certain problems of behavior and the sen@@ sa@@ tional nature of young girls . ”
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules .
“ They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they deal with hygiene issues , ” said K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
“ It was a shock , ” remember a woman whose daughter had his first rules at 10 years .
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules , it was not emotional .
She returned from the frigh@@ tened and sha@@ ken school to be the first one .
There are many the@@ ories made to public knowledge about the causes of the early pu@@ ri@@ ad .
Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages from the media are responsible .
boys , like girls , reach their pu@@ n earlier .
K@@ a@@ ap@@ ow@@ it@@ z says that the most credible hypo@@ thesis is the obesity epidemic .
He took part in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9 , linking the fat mass to the trigger of pu@@ ber@@ ty .
Other findings support this conclusion , but there are many other influential factors .
In that country , young Afric@@ an-@@ American and His@@ panic girls tend to reach the pu@@ ber@@ ty age earlier than white girls .
There are various explanations . There are various explanations .
On a global scale , the mechanisms of early pu@@ ber@@ ty seem to be influenced by everything , economic conditions for climate and genes .
Another problem is that , although boys have po@@ les on the face and in the younger pu@@ bian area , the trend towards a real early pu@@ ber@@ ty is not as pronounced as among girls .
Other doctors participating in the A@@ PA conference insisted on the complexity of the subject .
The appearance of the ac@@ id and pu@@ n is common , even in inf@@ ants and the small .
&apos;@@ We have to be careful about the way in which we identify the true appearance of pu@@ ber@@ ty &apos; , said Dr L@@ aw@@ rence Sil@@ ver@@ man , a child of en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ olog@@ ists working in the hospital for children Gor@@ i@@ e@@ b in Mor@@ ris@@ town , New Jer@@ se@@ y .
Pa@@ rents should not hesitate to ask their pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric@@ a to know how to talk with their children .
“ This may mean having a convers@@ ation earlier than planned , ” explained K@@ a@@ ple@@ ow@@ it@@ z .
If you remain calm , your child will respond in general .
Those d@@ augh@@ ters whose pu@@ ri@@ que is early must be reassured that even when it happens earlier , the process is part of life .

If L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is did not exist , the two fil@@ m@@ -@@ music f@@ ans built their history on real person@@ alities at the time like the mad D@@ a@@ ve V@@ on R@@ on@@ k .
The idea was to show the moment before Green@@ w@@ ich village , this New York neigh@@ bor@@ hood , to become &quot; the ep@@ ic@@ entre of the boom in mad music that would create international st@@ ars &quot; as the journalist E@@ li@@ j@@ ah Wal@@ d , a friend of Van R@@ on@@ k , wrote .
The film then takes docu@@ mentary lo@@ ads , the d@@ ust music label inv@@ aded 3@@ 3@@ ,@@ 3@@ ,@@ 3@@ T , invented by an old un@@ pay@@ able secre@@ tary , the mu@@ si@@ cal choices of the days of the day and the c@@ af@@ és where the chan@@ ters came .
The Col@@ en bro@@ thers are still operating by including a fun@@ ny figure running through the film constantly : a beautiful ru@@ b in the gu@@ ise of L@@ le@@ w@@ y@@ n D@@ av@@ is .
When it came to the way in which he made up his figure , the player and sing@@ er Ju@@ ti@@ n Tim@@ ber@@ la@@ ke had reminded us of &quot; growing in the T@@ en@@ es@@ se@@ e , b@@ red by the blu@@ t and the c@@ rown &quot; .

Ph@@ om@@ è@@ ne of the French edi@@ tion , G@@ ér@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , who died on Thursday at 83 , had just published his 200@@ th SA@@ S , &quot; The Kremlin &apos;s V@@ en@@ ice . &quot;
In February , the New York Times devoted it as &apos; the author of es@@ pion@@ age who knew too much &apos; .
Then he had passed ten days in Afghanistan , the theat@@ re of 19@@ 8 and 199@@ 0s of the famous series of es@@ pion@@ age waves .
When , physically , a very serious heart accident in December 2010 was carried out , it was moving during the trip with a dis@@ am@@ bul@@ ator .
And , before Afghanistan , he was also in Libya , Russia , Lebanon , and Mal@@ i .
With four SA@@ S published a year , G@@ ér@@ ard de V@@ illi@@ ers , born on 8 December 19@@ 29 in Paris , ensured that the exact number of books sold since 196@@ 5 and the publication of &apos; SA@@ S in Istanbul &apos; , the first of the series , was published almost half a century ago .
&apos;@@ No doubt between 120 and 150 million countries &apos; , he was making progress in March .
His Burmese c@@ ous@@ es on the k@@ nees , in his immense a@@ partment of a Fo@@ ch Fo@@ ol building at two from the Ar@@ c Ar@@ c , the m@@ align@@ ous eye under his white ha@@ ir , cited some of the languages in which SA@@ S ad@@ ven@@ tures were translated : Italian , German , Russian , Greek , Japanese or Korean .

On the ground , I meet journalists , including those of the A@@ F@@ P , diplomats , people of services that I have known for some 20 or 30 years .
As a result , many of his SA@@ S are often pre@@ mon@@ i@@ fying : so , a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre killed several senior officials , he told the story in the “ D@@ em@@ as of Dam@@ as@@ cus . ”
In &quot; B@@ eng@@ haz@@ i &quot; , he was the first to reveal the existence of an CIA secret command centre in this city , the cra@@ dle of the Libyan revol@@ t .

S@@ p@@ on@@ ers are squ@@ ab@@ bling about the size of the seats when large orders are at stake at stake ?
The dispute is ra@@ ging between the large aircraft manufacturers over the larg@@ es@@ se of the tourist class on long-@@ distance flights , opening the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dub@@ ai aer@@ on@@ au@@ tical Tri@@ el in the month of month .
The conflict is about the bread@@ th of seats proposed on long-@@ distance flights to economic class passengers – who are not always the most crow@@ ded by the airlines , but whose space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus and Bo@@ eing C@@ o .
This week Airbus called the aviation industry to set up a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 h@@ ens ( 4@@ 5.@@ 72 c@@ m ) in the economic classes , but its great American rival Bo@@ eing says that it should be up to airlines to decide .
The dispute erup@@ ted as the sho@@ kers seek to sell even larger versions of their new@@ -@@ bro@@ ker aircraft , possibly hoping for a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November .
The way in which seats will be prepared on the back of the plane – in particular , there will be 9 or 10 fron@@ t@@ seats – is essential for the economic output of the “ mini-@@ tw@@ m@@ bo ” seg@@ ment .
Bo@@ eing says that the re@@ constructed 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X will be able to accommodate 40@@ 6 people in seats of more than 17 broad h@@ ices , and will be confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 seats .
Airbus points out that the competing version of its A@@ 350 will include 350 people in seats of 18 h@@ ens of large sto@@ res of 9 .
Air gi@@ ants often exchange b@@ lows on technical issues by making advertising into the professional press .
Today , Airbus is calling directly to the public before the Dub@@ ai aer@@ ial sal@@ on , where 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders .
Recently , we have seen what might be the start of a new advertising war with the financial presentation of a pho@@ to showing three people against each other in restaur@@ ants , entitled “ Would you accept that ? ”
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ distance flights in narrow@@ er seats than in regional tur@@ bo@@ pro@@ s@@ ers &apos; , as John Le@@ h@@ y , a commercial director of Airbus , said .
As eating habits change , people grow , but seats in aircraft have not changed radically .
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when Bo@@ eing ’ s 7@@ 47 ju@@ ridic@@ o defined the modern long-@@ run journey , and the turn of the century , the average US average of 40 to 49 increased by 10 % , according to US Department of Health data .
The size of the average American in the twenty-first century is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 h@@ ens , according to US health statistics .
Airbus says that his rival is cl@@ inging to a sie@@ ge that dates back to the 195@@ 0s , when the new@@ ly-@@ called “ et break ” circ@@ us was closer .
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that an additional ca@@ p in the size of seats would improve the quality of the sle@@ ep of 53 % .
Bo@@ eing disputes Airbus &apos;s figures as regards the size of seats and says that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment .
He also says that the study shows that cab@@ in experience depends not only on the size of seats .
&apos;@@ It is really a question of providing the airlines with flexibility and enabling them to do what they think they have to do to carry out their activities &apos; , said K@@ ent C@@ ou@@ er , who is responsible for passengers &apos; satisfaction at Bo@@ eing .
They do not want to be told what will enable them to be profitable .
They know their businesses better than anyone else .
For passengers , it is more about having a certain freedom of movement , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results .
Beh@@ ind the dispute there is a race for aircraft orders for an estimated $ 700 M@@ d at the price of the market in the coming decades , enough to raise the balance of US and European exports .
As Re@@ u@@ ters said for the first time in July , the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the most recent aircraft .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing both claim a seat per seat in their latest long-@@ bro@@ ked models 20 % higher than that of the market leader in this seg@@ ment , the Bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ ER of 3@@ 65 seats .
The performance announced by Bo@@ eing depends partly on the comparison between 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation with 10 seats per r@@ ank and a 7@@ 77 of its original model .
The benefit in terms of unit costs is low compared to the confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated apparatus with 10 seats per ta@@ g currently in service .
&apos;@@ Bo@@ eing is doing this in order to cover more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by comparison with our products &apos; , declared K@@ ev@@ in Ken@@ is@@ on , Director of Con@@ stant P@@ ass@@ er at the European avi@@ d Airbus .
On the other hand , analy@@ sts say that the boo@@ ked boo@@ ths with 10 seats in the existing 7@@ 77 seats suggest that many passengers support a more den@@ se confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ation , which can go hand in hand with cheaper prices .
&apos;@@ One of 18 h@@ ell@@ s would be perfect for passengers , but the reality is that , from a commercial point of view , the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 7@@ 77 , and has declared the in-@@ house expert M@@ ary Kir@@ by , foun@@ der and ed@@ itor of R@@ un@@ way G@@ ir@@ le Network .
Airbus and Bo@@ eing do not provide seats , but offer a catalogue of suppliers , among which airlines must choose .
Air@@ craft sel@@ lers who go around the world even take a me@@ tre to check the competing confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations .
While reven@@ ging from offering comfortable appli@@ ances , all manufacturers also offer aircraft with highly den@@ sity confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ations to low-cost airlines and regional travel .
Airbus provides an A@@ 350 confi@@ g@@ ur@@ ated with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it .
Until recently , Airbus stressed the need for greater person@@ alisation of the boo@@ ths by offering larger seats on some of its aircraft .
Without the support of the other major manufacturer of large modern appli@@ ances , experts say that it is unlikely that his appeal to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats will lead , but that he could forget the sales wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ X .
The shareholders of O@@ r@@ ri@@ le irrit@@ ated by El@@ l@@ reason &apos;s salary pay
A majority of O@@ r@@ bar shareholders voted on Thursday against the pay proposal for the foun@@ der and Director-General Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , given the financial performance of his group .
The vote is not binding , but it does away with the image of Lar@@ ry El@@ l@@ ison , a third world wealth , just as un@@ be@@ arable as its ship victory at the American Cup .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire still holds 25 % of the software of the software group that it co-@@ founded 40 years ago .
Last year , El@@ l@@ ison had voted against his pay .
The bos@@ le ’ s bos@@ s gave up a $ 1.2 million bon@@ us for the financial year 2013 , which was closed in May because of the group ’ s poor performance , which failed its growth goals , but received some $ 77 million from stock options .
Its fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar .
The net benefit of the year 2013 has risen by 3.5 % in the year 2013 , while the stock exchange rate of 27@@ .5 % , plus the S &amp; amp ; P 500 index , which took 24 % at the same time .
The new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking smoking .
Scienti@@ sts have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette .
A single do@@ se of the vaccine was able to protect the m@@ ouse from nic@@ ot@@ ine addiction .
Other tests are needed before we start testing on human beings , but Professor Cor@@ ald C@@ ry@@ st@@ al of We@@ ill Cor@@ n@@ ell College of New York has said that the first signs are encouraging .
&apos;@@ We really hope that this sort of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop , exhaust all methods currently available on the market , but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches &apos; , as Professor Cor@@ n@@ ell said .
The new vaccine contains an harm@@ less virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
The virus selec@@ tively infec@@ ts li@@ ver cells , which then begin to produce a regular flow of anti@@ bodies .
The anti@@ bodies treat all m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules of nic@@ ot@@ ine present in the blood system and neutr@@ alise them before they reach the brain , which prevents the smo@@ ker from having his do@@ se of nic@@ ot@@ ine .
During the tests , the vacc@@ inated m@@ ice that was then given the nic@@ ot@@ ine continued their normal business .
But the m@@ ouse who had not been vacc@@ inated “ was appe@@ ased , ” declared researchers , sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their brain .
The experience is described in the Science Trans@@ Latin Me@@ di@@ ine .
Pre@@ vious vaccines against tobacco have proved ineffective because they contained anti@@ bodies .
The injec@@ tions needed to be repeated so frequently so that anti@@ body levels remain high that they were too expensive and un@@ practical .
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ bodies .
Professor C@@ ry@@ st@@ al said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe , it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette , which would prevent any addiction to nic@@ ot@@ ine .
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking .
&apos;@@ They will know that if they start smoking they will not be happy because of the anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vaccine , and that can help them to lose their bad habit &apos; .
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but pointed out that much more research is needed .
The Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a d@@ one on a d@@ one d@@ one
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement , H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south , was killed in an American dr@@ one on Friday in Pakistan .
H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ south &apos;s death has been announced several times in the past .
But intelligence officials , the army , and the activis@@ t have said this time that he had lost their lives in this strike , waged in the North W@@ az@@ ir@@ istan region .
&apos;@@ We can confirm that H@@ ak@@ im@@ ul@@ lah Me@@ h@@ South was killed in a dr@@ one attack &apos; , said a senior security officer .
The day before , Pakistani Prime Minister N@@ awa@@ z Shar@@ if , travelling to London , informed the British Government that talks had been initiated with T@@ h@@ ri@@ k e Pakistan ( T@@ T@@ P ) , the Pakistani Taliban movement .
Tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies that O@@ be@@ id is influenced by O@@ be@@ id
The former Labour Minister in South Wales , Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di , will be investigated by the state anti-@@ corruption regulator .
The former minister of South Wales in the South Jo@@ e Tri@@ po@@ di denied that he had changed trade policy at the request of his political ment@@ or Ed@@ die O@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three goods in the govern@@ ment-@@ controlled zone .
On Friday , the Independent Committee on Industry ( IC@@ C ) extended its investigation into whether Mr O@@ be@@ id had put pressure on several government ministers to renew his b@@ ars in C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Qua@@ y , where the O@@ be@@ id had two restaur@@ ants and coffee , after their expiry in August 2005 , without there being any ten@@ ders .
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr Tri@@ po@@ di was aware of Mr O@@ be@@ id &apos;s secret interest in these properties , following the testi@@ mony of the former deputy Secretary-General of Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , Lyn@@ ne Ash@@ pol@@ le , on Thursday .
During the years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government pressed for a call for ten@@ ders to be issued .
The ten@@ ants were against and wanted longer periods .
In 2009 , the b@@ ars about C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ar Qua@@ y , which reported to the O@@ be@@ id $ 2.5 per year , were renewed without there being any call for tender .
Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , who was Minister for Por@@ ts from February 2006 to November 2009 , was initially in favour of ten@@ ders .
But he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr O@@ be@@ id , who acknowledged Mr Tri@@ po@@ di , calling for a change in government policy .
The trans@@ cri@@ pt of telephone convers@@ ations presented to the IC@@ C demonstrated calls in August and September 2007 between Mr O@@ be@@ id , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di and Ste@@ ve D@@ un@@ n , a senior official who had arrived to the Ministry of Por@@ ts after working under the orders of Mr O@@ be@@ id in the Ministry of Fisheries .
&quot; The subject discussed during these telephone convers@@ ations was the development of trade policy , &quot; asked the deputy Commissioner An@@ th@@ ony W@@ he@@ al@@ y to Mr Tri@@ po@@ di .
&apos;@@ No &apos; , Mr Tri@@ po@@ di replied .
I do not remember what we discussed , but at least that was not the case .
In any case , certainly not between me and Mr O@@ be@@ id .
Israeli War planes are targeting Syria , declaring a responsible person responsible for Syria to be responsible for Syria .
Israeli war@@ planes reached a target in the Syrian port of La@@ ak@@ ia on Thursday evening , confirming a military officer at Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
The official did not specify what the target was , but said that there was at least one .
The Associ@@ ate P@@ is reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA@@ -@@ 1@@ 25 .
At least twice this year , Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria .
Foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa could have a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test .
The government is currently investigating the possibility of introducing a &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; test for foreign workers in possession of a 4@@ 57 visa .
The test , if adopted , would be applied under a criterion to prevent visas 4@@ 57 from being used to fill un@@ skilled posts or as a hi@@ j@@ acked means of bringing their family and friends to Australia .
A government working document has been revealed today , while Labour MEP Ma@@ x@@ ine Mc@@ K@@ e@@ w denounced the government dis@@ course on foreign workers , saying that he could off@@ end Australia &apos;s neighbors .
“ The b@@ agg@@ ering declarations about &quot; ali@@ en foreigners &quot; and &quot; jobs for the Austr@@ ali@@ ans first &quot; are an unpleasant return when unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said to Austr@@ ali@@ a India Institute today .
His@@ tor@@ ically , this meant that the work of the wh@@ ites had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historic flav@@ our .
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by the former immigration minister Ch@@ ris Bow@@ en .
Mi@@ gration Minister B@@ ren@@ an O &apos;@@ Con@@ no@@ r , who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are being examined .
If the &apos; auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity &apos; criterion were adopted , a visa see@@ ker could be checked to know &apos; if the offer of employment is genuine if the candidate is a personal link or personal involvement of the owner or person concerned in the company spons@@ or &apos; .
Com@@ pan@@ ies could also be obliged to declare the number of visa holders 4@@ 57 after some of them , having had the intention of spons@@ oring a small number of workers , actually employed hundreds .
In the meantime , a 35 year-old Sri Lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker would have died from a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers on the Chris@@ top@@ s island this week .
The rich son of the age of 9 , went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father &apos;s death on Wednesday with an adult c@@ ous@@ in who was also on board .
The Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities have been transferred urgently by the Austr@@ ali@@ an authorities to the hospital on the Chris@@ to@@ s island , where they died .
A study to increase the benefits of the H@@ S@@ 2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British Government .
The work carried out by H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Ph@@ a@@ is 1 opened in 20@@ 26 .
The Minister for Transport Baroness K@@ ram@@ er said that the project &apos; would bring the United Kingdom together &apos; .
The Scottish Minister for Transport , K@@ eth@@ h Brown , said ‘ ex@@ é ’ to the idea of working with the British Government on the project .
Ph@@ as@@ se 1 will be about a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Mid@@ lands .
When P@@ ase 2 is completed , the lines will be Man@@ ch@@ ester and Le@@ eds .
In June , the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England , from 3@@ 2.@@ 7 M@@ d to 4@@ 2.@@ 6 M@@ d .
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has asked H@@ S@@ 2 L@@ t@@ d to study the strengthening of rail capacity and to improve the length of journey for the north of England and Scotland .
This must include the possibility of travelling time between G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh by three hours at most .
Baroness K@@ ram@@ er said : “ Our goal for H@@ S@@ 2 relates to a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together . ”
We are pushing the H@@ S@@ 2 project because the advantages it presents are enormous .
Without it we have a problem with the capacity of our rail network .
But it is also a question of developing connec@@ tivity between the 18 major British cities , including G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w and Edinburgh , so that links between them are better thanks to H@@ S@@ 2 .
The British Secretary of State for Scotland , Al@@ lis@@ ta@@ r Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el , added : &apos; Today &apos;s announcement is good news for Scotland . &apos;
For the Scottish Government , K@@ eg@@ h Brown called on Mr Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ l to support the inclusion of Scotland in the H@@ S@@ 2 network unequivocally .
Mr Brown said : &apos; The high-speed train has the potential to bring considerable economic benefits to Scotland , but it also brings Scotland &apos;s economic weight into the overall high-speed rail network throughout Britain .
&apos;@@ We are therefore exc@@ ited about working in partnership with the British Government to examine options for bringing the high-speed rail network up to Scotland , creating an advantage for all and supple@@ menting the G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w@@ -@@ Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning .
“ I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year , and then we will decide together on the next steps . ”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia for the time being .
Austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers will have to continue to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their t@@ ab@@ lets and s@@ por@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es during the take@@ -up and landing despite the US action to ease the regulation on electronic appli@@ ances .
The Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to US carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books , watch vide@@ os , or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases , provided they are in the air mode .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers can already do so for most of the flight , but many people find it difficult to access their electronic books during take@@ -@@ off and landing .
Austr@@ ali@@ an carriers are examining the decision which obliges American carriers to do important work to meet the requirements , but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately .
The Civil Aviation Authority has also said that it is looking at the announcement but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases are still in force in Australia .
&apos;@@ The CA@@ SA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft by air &apos; .
The issue is the subject of regulation which obliges aircraft operators to guarantee permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by crew members .
Vir@@ g@@ in , who has already spoken in the CA@@ SA about its intention to extend the use of its enter@@ tainment system using W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology , was open to change , but has said it would follow the regulator .
&apos;@@ We would welcome a review of the CA@@ SA which would allow the use of electronic appli@@ ances because we really believe that this would improve the customer experience now that we have ( from the enter@@ tainment system using W@@ i-@@ F@@ i technology ) on our aircraft &apos; .
Q@@ an@@ t@@ as said that it is currently complying with the current rules .
&apos;@@ In accordance with our current policy , electronic appli@@ ances cannot be used during take@@ -@@ off and landing , and we do not intend immediately to change that &apos; .
The decision by the FA@@ A applies to US airlines .
However , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers , and we will look closely at the decision of the FA@@ A and the reasons for it .
For American carriers , the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet .
The carriers will have to show that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic appli@@ ances , as well as review tex@@ t@@ books , training equipment , hand lu@@ gg@@ age transport programmes and passenger instructions .
“ As soon as an airline checked the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use light mobile devices , such as t@@ ab@@ lets , electronic books , and sh@@ ut@@ ph@@ on@@ es at all al@@ titude , ” said the FA@@ A .
In rare cases of low visibility , the crew will ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances during the landing .
The group has also recommended that heavi@@ er equipment be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compar@@ tments during the take@@ -up and landing .

Singapore ’ s Singapore Tr@@ enders benefit from the middle classes forced to tighten their bel@@ ts
In a len@@ der of the B@@ end@@ em@@ er commercial center in Singapore , J@@ an@@ ani A@@ mi@@ re@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a pain@@ ts a po@@ t , a jo@@ ke , and a p@@ ound of gold bo@@ xes to pay for his d@@ augh@@ ters ’ scho@@ oling .
“ My hus@@ band and I have just bought a house that is all my money , ” says Mrs A@@ mir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
Although it gains $ 3@@ ,000 from Singapore ( $ 2@@ ,@@ 400 ) per month as ad@@ vers@@ aries and her hus@@ band also works , monthly family income is not enough .
In fact , demand is such in parts of Sou@@ theast Asia – where household debt increases – that V@@ alum@@ e@@ y@@ x , where it has carried out its transaction , has become the third largest loan company this week to be introduced on the Singapore stock exchange .
Se@@ tting up je@@ wel@@ s is not only a quick means of obtaining cash – $ 1 300 in Singapore in the case of Mrs A@@ mir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but it is almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
In general , Singapore ’ s l@@ enders levy an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % offered by the United States ’ Un@@ it O@@ ver@@ se@@ as Bank , a local donor with a branch in the same commercial center .
However , l@@ enders have the advantage of not asking for solvency verification or evidence of pay , and can release loans more quickly than banks .
As a result , millions of people across the region turn to l@@ enders , while families feel the pressure of rising living costs and over-@@ indeb@@ tedness of households and consumers .
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fueled by excessively lax monetary policy in advanced economies , low and middle-@@ income families turn to l@@ enders to fill the difference while their economies are slowing down .
This week , the credit rating agency Stand@@ ard &amp; amp ; Po@@ int mentioned the rising debt of households , owing mainly to rising mortgage lending , as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks .
She said that Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore recorded the highest debt / GDP ratio in Asia .
Malaysia comes at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , compared to 60 % in 2008 .
Econom@@ ists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week emerged from a technical recession .
On Thursday , data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand .
“ The balance sheet is that , with rising costs , people in the middle or bottom &#91; wage scale &#93; seek to supplement their income as they can ’ , S@@ ong S@@ en@@ g W@@ u@@ n , an economist at IC@@ M@@ B , a Malay@@ sian bank .
His@@ tor@@ ically high gold prices over the past two years have meant that people have been quick to put their personal effects to the cash value of their je@@ wel@@ s .
In Singapore , about 70 % of the items in the 200@@ 200 loan bu@@ ff@@ ers on the securities are in gold .
People say , &apos; the price of gold is high , let us have the golden chain of grand@@ mother and we will be looking for it next month &apos; .
In Thailand , the largest bon@@ us operator , E@@ asy@@ Mon@@ ey , has recorded a 20 % increase in the number of customers using their shops in recent months .
The rising loan sector is such that V@@ alum@@ e@@ y@@ x , the shop operator in B@@ end@@ em@@ er and 15 other shops like this in Singapore , is planning to develop not only in neighb@@ oring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia .
The company will finance them by using 60 % of Singapore ’ s 66 % of the world ’ s $ 66 million this week .
While some low@@ er-@@ rate l@@ enders have criticized the ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant interest rates that they carry out , M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah suggests that the deposit offers not only lower rates than other l@@ enders , but that , in addition , it does not increase debt directly .
“ clients are mortg@@ aging goods that they already possess , and mone@@ tization of their personal property does not increase household debt , ” she says .
The establishment is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term .
People who travel to l@@ enders are not only those who have financial problems .
The rich people in Singapore also go into the V@@ alum@@ e@@ y@@ x loan bu@@ ff@@ ers to provide gold or Ro@@ le@@ x mon@@ ks , which can represent up to 60 % of their purchase price .
We see customers from all sections of society .
“ It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment activities , or small businesses that have cash needs to move a difficult course , ” adding M@@ iss Y@@ e@@ ah .
Sometimes they just need money very quickly .

The $ 3@@ 25 rescue plan for the health system of the T@@ as@@ man@@ ia
The federal government maintains that the $ 3@@ 25 billion bailout package for the v@@ agu@@ ely health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that government government will not waste the funds .
Federal Health Minister T@@ u@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced that the Comm@@ on@@ wealth is taking “ urgent steps ” to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state , the high rate of chronic illness and the system ’ s constraints .
The funding for four years was decided after consultations by the government with the independent Member of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia , An@@ drew Wil@@ k@@ ie .
&apos;@@ The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan which , in our opinion , will solve the unique difficulties facing the state &apos; , which Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k has said today .
The $ 3@@ 25 million plan includes a $ 31 per $ 31 campaign for non-@@ urgent sur@@ ger@@ y .
2 600 additional operations , particularly in the area of or@@ th@@ opa@@ di@@ que sur@@ ger@@ y and ca@@ tar@@ ation , will help catch up .
Funds are also provided for clin@@ ics without meeting in H@@ ob@@ art and L@@ au@@ n@@ es@@ ton , better external care , training of medical frameworks , mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical systems in local hospitals .
‘ These investments respond to the idea that , according to first-@@ line clin@@ ic@@ ians , this is the best way to treat the health system of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia , ” Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
The Minister said that the government in T@@ as@@ man@@ ia would be faced with a strict regime of preparation of reports and accounts .
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Comm@@ on@@ wealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends the additional funds .
A committee consisting of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible .
Mr Wil@@ k@@ ie said today that the $ 3@@ 25 million will not count for much “ unless they are followed by real reform to consolidate the public health system of T@@ as@@ man@@ ia . ”
He nevertheless congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .
&apos;@@ I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system from T@@ as@@ ia on the black@@ list &apos; .
According to the government government , these additional non-@@ urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
But the spokes@@ person for the health opposition Peter Du@@ t@@ ton believes that today &apos;s announcement is a &apos; fortune solution &apos; .
“ The reason we are here is that the state Labour Government has withdrawn $ 4@@ 30 from its health system , ” he said on A@@ BC TV .
One cannot have a government of the state that is spending almost half a billion dollars and the Comm@@ on@@ wealth that puts $ 300 , and claims that it is a good day .
Mr Du@@ t@@ ton visited Mrs P@@ liber@@ se@@ k to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .

Syria has destroyed its capacity for producing chemical weapons - dec@@ la@@ res the supervisory body , the supervisory body , and dec@@ la@@ res the monitoring body .
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and am@@ muni@@ tion with toxic gas , declared the international chemical monitoring body on Thursday , while violent clashes ra@@ ging in the north of the country , close to one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored .
A group of Syrian milit@@ ants also declared Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago .
The announcement by the Organisation for the Ch@@ em@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons ( ICA@@ O ) arrived in advance on the deadline of the deadline of the deadline for the Ch@@ em@@ ical We@@ ap@@ ons .
1 November set by the organisation based in The Hague ord@@ ers in Dam@@ as@@ cus to destroy or “ un@@ us@@ able ” all chemical weapons production units and machines to mix toxic gases and fill am@@ muni@@ tion .
The completion of what is essentially the phase of initial destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Dam@@ as@@ cus by mid-@@ 2014 .
Thanks to the destruction of equipment , Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
However , Dam@@ as@@ cus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves .
It is believed that the country has about 1 000 tonnes of chemicals and chemical weapons , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the neuro@@ toxic agent s@@ ar@@ in agent .
The announcement was made when the fighting was ra@@ ging on Thursday in the town of Sa@@ fi@@ ra which , according to the experts , ho@@ sts a unit for chemical weapons and storage sites , reported the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory based in Britain .
The group of milit@@ ants , following the evolution of the human toll through a network of milit@@ ants based in Syria , declared Thursday that 120 2@@ 96 people died .
Of these , it is estimated that there were 61 0@@ 67 civilians , 6 3@@ 65 children .
On the government side , 29 9@@ 54 members of President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad ’ s armed forces have died , including 18 6@@ 78 fighters of pro-@@ government forces and 18@@ 7 Lebanese Hezbollah milit@@ ants .
Of the dead , it is also estimated that 2 20@@ 2 were deser@@ ters and some 5 3@@ 75 of opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
On 25 July , the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011 .
It has not updated this figure since then .
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict .
Assad ’ s troops are fighting against the rebels , many of whom have been linked to al-@@ Qaeda groups in Sa@@ fi@@ ra for weeks .
The Observ@@ atory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides but did not give any prec@@ ision .
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission , which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsen@@ al in the midst of a continuing civil war within a tight time frame .
A statement by the ICA@@ O , which works closely with the UN , indicated that its team was “ now satisfied with controlled – and seen destroyed – all the critical production and machinery for mi@@ xing and filling . ”
She added that &apos; no other inspection activity was planned at the moment &apos; .
Ear@@ lier this week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first stage of the verification work , visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Dam@@ as@@ cus .
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety , which indicated the inspectors .
On Thursday , the ICA@@ O said that the two sites were , according to Syria , &apos; abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they were content with had been moved to other declared sites , which were inspec@@ ted &apos; .
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the unity of Sa@@ fi@@ ra was one of the two sites that the ICA@@ O inspectors were unable to visit .
Syria has submitted a plan to destroy its chemical weapons , which was approved the following month by the ICA@@ O Executive Committee .
&quot; I sal@@ ute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult task ever undertaken by this organisation , &quot; said the Director-General of the organisation Ah@@ met U@@ z@@ um@@ escu , in a comment published by the ICA@@ O .
Now in its third year , civil war is mainly a matter of Sunni Muslim rebels in Assad ’ s government and security forces , which are supported by members of the al@@ law@@ ite sec@@ t , a branch of Shia Islam .
On the other hand , the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of La@@ ak@@ ia .
The cause of the explosion is still unknown , he added .
Co@@ al caused by the sentence against one of the Bali bomb post@@ ers
The survi@@ v@@ ors and relatives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence against the last con@@ spir@@ ators to be brought to justice , saying that U@@ mar P@@ at@@ k should be shot by an execution pe@@ g .
P@@ at@@ ek , who spent almost 10 years on flight as one of the most sought men in South-East Asia , was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosive devices used in the attacks .
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release .
The 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two night bo@@ xes in the K@@ ut@@ ta popular tourist district , who caused the deaths of 20@@ 2 people , including 88 Austr@@ ali@@ ans , and made many injured .
It has also been convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism , including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000 .
The prosecu@@ tors have asked for a life of life imprisonment , yet they could have asked for the man , known as &apos; D@@ ic@@ tion M@@ an &apos; , to be sentenced to death .
The decision revi@@ ved painful memories for J@@ a Cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of Per@@ th who lost his two 3@@ 9-@@ year-old tw@@ ils , J@@ ane and Jen@@ ny , in the destruction of P@@ at@@ ek and other con@@ spir@@ ators nearly 10 years ago .
On the brink of te@@ ars , she said that P@@ at@@ ek should have been sentenced to death .
I really believe that he should have gone along the same path as other men .
&apos;@@ It should be dra@@ gged down in front of the execu@@ tion &apos; , Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en said to the A@@ PA .
I have to live every day without having other grand@@ children or seeing my girls .
Sar@@ i C@@ lu@@ b was completely destroyed when a huge bomb , charged in an out@@ door g@@ ate , explo@@ ded just after 23 p.m. on 12 October 2002 .
Peter Hughes was in P@@ ad@@ ys &apos;s B@@ ar when a suicide bom@@ ber broke a ba@@ g with explo@@ si@@ ves of just 20 seconds earlier .
He sin@@ ked into the com@@ a after the attack and remained un@@ conscious for a month , and he is &apos; dead &apos; three times when he was under res@@ pir@@ atory assistance .
Mr Hughes said that P@@ at@@ ek should have known the same fate as the other three members of J@@ em@@ a@@ ah Islam@@ i@@ y@@ ah ’ s terrorist cell – Am@@ ro@@ z@@ i , Mu@@ k@@ k@@ as , and I@@ ma@@ m Sam@@ u@@ ra – who were executed four years ago .
In fact , this man should have been sentenced to death before others .
To keep it alive , why there is no reason to keep it alive .
P@@ utting 20 years in prison after killing 20@@ 2 people and injured hundreds of others is not much .
P@@ at@@ ek is the last of the Bali bombings to be brought to justice .
He had managed to avoid being caught for nearly 10 years , but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Ab@@ bot@@ bat@@ d , where US forces will kill former al-@@ Qaeda leader Os@@ ama bin Laden less than four months later .
During the trial , a F@@ B@@ I agent said that intelligence reports had revealed that P@@ at@@ ek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of restoring links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al Qaeda .
&apos;@@ He did not go &apos; , added Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en .
Until recently , he has made a mo@@ ck@@ ery of the gri@@ ef he had been able to cause to other people .
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by cere@@ monies in Bali and Australia .
&apos;@@ There will be a lot of people this year &apos; , Mrs Cor@@ te@@ en said .
P@@ at@@ ek , however , can appeal for his condemnation .
FA@@ A : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on board aeroplan@@ es ( but not via their mobile phone ) .
Air@@ lines of airlines will be able to use their do@@ or@@ -to-@@ door electronic devices to read , work , play games , watch films , and listen to music – but not to talk about their mobile phones – under the highly expected new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration .
But passengers should not be expected to expect immediate changes .
The speed with which change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another , declared the adminis@@ tr@@ ator of the FA@@ A Mic@@ hael H@@ er@@ ta at a press conference .
Air@@ lines will have to prove to the FA@@ A that their aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training tex@@ t@@ books of crew members and the rules on the ti@@ pping of aircraft .
The FA@@ A has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of electronic appli@@ ances on their aircraft .
Del@@ ta and J@@ et@@ Blue are among the companies that have already submitted plans .
&apos;@@ In accordance with the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic appli@@ ances very soon &apos; .
At present , passengers have to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their s@@ por@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es , t@@ ab@@ lets and other appli@@ ances as soon as the air doors are closed .
They are not supposed to re@@ fine them before the plane reaches an al@@ titude of 10 000 feet and the comm@@ ander gives the green light .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers are supposed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances at the flight of the plane before the landing and not re@@ kin@@ dle them until the plane came .
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will allow passengers to use their appli@@ ances during take@@ -@@ off , landing and ground whe@@ els , declared the FA@@ A .
Most new air@@ planes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to higher al@@ titude , should meet the criteria .
L@@ a G@@ lad@@ ing , Chairman of the Association of Pro@@ f@@ es@@ es@@ al F@@ li@@ ving At@@ tend@@ ant , was happy with these changes .
“ Once the new policy implemented safely – and we are going to work closely with carriers for this – it will benefit everyone ’ s , ” explained G@@ lad@@ ing in a statement .
We are , frankly , tired of feeling to be &apos; the watch@@ dogs &apos; when it comes to this issue .
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet for over@@ f@@ lowing , exchange em@@ ail@@ s and SM@@ S , or down@@ loading data below 10@@ ,000 feet .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers will have to put their s@@ por@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es , t@@ ab@@ lets and other aircraft aircraft .
So there are still no World W@@ ith Fri@@ ends , the S@@ cr@@ b@@ ble online game to which the actor Ale@@ c Bal@@ d@@ win played on his s@@ ample in 2011 when he was expelled from an American Air@@ lines plane after refusing to ext@@ ingu@@ ish his equipment while the apparatus was kept at the door .
And heavi@@ er appli@@ ances like mobile computers will always have to be con@@ tested because they could hurt someone if they fly through the cab@@ in .
The mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned .
Regul@@ atory power on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communic@@ ations Commission and not to the FA@@ A .
The FA@@ A can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take@@ -@@ off and landing landing
Last month , Mar@@ k Ros@@ en@@ ker of the National T@@ ran@@ si@@ tional N@@ ation , a national transport safety expert on C@@ B@@ S Ne@@ ws , said that mobile phones were always regarded as a risk .
&apos;@@ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they may possibly create interference with navigation instruments , but because we know , according to the F@@ CC@@ C , that they could dis@@ rupt mobile phone offices if they are used on board &apos; .
An industrial advisory committee created by the FA@@ A to examine the problem recommended last month that the government would allow the wider use of personal electronic devices .
The pressure on the FA@@ A has increased over recent years to rela@@ x restrictions on their use .
Cri@@ tics like Sen@@ ator C@@ l@@ aire Mc@@ Cas@@ k@@ l , D@@ -@@ M@@ o , argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans .
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of appli@@ ances has become om@@ ni@@ present .
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances or deliberately do so .
The FA@@ A began to limit the use of electronic appli@@ ances in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported F@@ M radio , the high-tech g@@ ad@@ mic@@ t of then .
New aeroplan@@ es depend far more on electricity systems than on previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FA@@ A .
The airlines have been allowing their passengers to use W@@ i-@@ F@@ i to cru@@ ise al@@ legi@@ ances for several years .
modified aircraft to host W@@ i-@@ F@@ i systems also better resist interference .
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow the wider use of electronic appli@@ ances under the new directives , declared Hu@@ ta .
Today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power broadcasting than previous generations of aircraft .
Elec@@ tr@@ onic books , for example , only em@@ it minimum trans@@ missions when you turn a page .
However , the trans@@ missions are stronger when the goods are over or send data .
Ama@@ z@@ on@@ .@@ co@@ m is among those who press for a rela@@ xation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers .
In 2011 , the leaders of the company charged a K@@ ind@@ le e-@@ books air@@ plane and left it to see if there were problems , but there were none .
This inspired members of the FA@@ A advisory committee with mixed feelings about whether or not the use of appli@@ ances is a risk .
D@@ ou@@ gl@@ as K@@ id@@ d of the National Association of Air@@ line P@@ ass@@ eng@@ ers said that he thought that aircraft interference was real , even if the risk was minimal .
Other members of the committee said that there are only an@@ ec@@ do@@ tal reports from pil@@ ots indicating that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems , and that most of them are very old .
However , the committee recommended that the FA@@ A should allow pil@@ ots to ask passengers to ext@@ ingu@@ ish their appli@@ ances during the landing of instruments under low visibility conditions .
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes , calling them for sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology .
&apos;@@ We are pleased that the FA@@ A recognises that a pleasant passenger experiment is not incompatible with security &apos; , has declared Ro@@ ger D@@ ow , President and Director of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tra@@ vel Association .

The commercial campaign for Brit@@ t@@ any was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what creat@@ ors of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU .
In order to do this , we commissioned the wid@@ est and most comprehensive investigation of British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain , businesses and the EU .
Y@@ ou@@ Goe@@ v questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs , who are generally representative of all sizes of business , sectors and regions in Britain .
The findings of the inquiry will be a surprise to many .
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe , focusing on the countries that are modern@@ izing and developing while the EU states are stag@@ n@@ ating .
They want to see the government priori@@ tising new trade links with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of reforming Europe ’ s institutional ar@@ ts .
When asked for their views on specific policy points – ranging from regulating monopolies to product laws – the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key skills should return to West@@ min@@ ster .
The single market has caused general dis@@ content , with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40 % of the large companies , traditionally the most pro-European ones , even agree .
Last but not least , our survey of the entrepreneurs showed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue the initiatives to change the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics .
This conclusion , which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes , shows that the business world insists on a “ significant change ” that re@@ sto@@ res power in the UK .
The stakes are high – to change the treaty and to represent Britain ’ s interests better would see a 16 % shift in votes in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum .
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment : this survey shows that British companies support this plan to re@@ negotiate the terms of Britain &apos;s membership of the EU .
It also shows that companies hope that re@@ negotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power to return to the UK .
It is possible , and increasingly necessary , to represent the interests of British companies better , since the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and , as the conclusions of our inquiry show , for businesses this means placing the emphasis again on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach in Brussels .
The United States with H@@ all@@ we@@ en col@@ ours
In the US , President Obama has not de@@ fied the tradition of H@@ all@@ we@@ en .
With his wife yesterday evening he distributed f@@ are@@ well to hundreds of children invited in the White House j@@ ard@@ ens in Washington .

Alexander Mill@@ er of Gaz@@ pro@@ m dec@@ la@@ res that the Bulgaria gas pipeline aug@@ urs a new era of gas gas .
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe &apos;s largest energy projects , declared the Director of Gaz@@ pro@@ m .
&apos;@@ A historic event has taken place today : construction started in Bulgaria &apos;s South Stream gas pipeline , the most important large-scale project in Europe &apos; , explained Alex@@ i Mill@@ er , the Director-General of Gaz@@ pro@@ m , in a statement on Thursday .
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire continent of Europe .
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia &apos;s export routes to Europe .
A contractual dispute between Gaz@@ pro@@ m and his Ukrainian counterpart , a country through which the largest part of Russian gas for Europe is transit , increases the level of risk relative to conventional channels , adding the director .
Mill@@ er added that the direct link to Bulgaria , a Member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &apos; forever &apos; .
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the whole project is put into operation in 2015 .
Gaz@@ pro@@ m has indicated that construction should start in other countries down@@ stream by the end of the year .
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .
P@@ it@@ ha@@ r@@ ine wants to create the world ’ s largest marine reserve
The Is@@ le of P@@ it@@ ka@@ r@@ n wants to create the world ’ s largest marine reserve , announced on Thursday the New Ta@@ h@@ ti newspaper , containing information from Rad@@ io Australia .
This island , in the east of the G@@ am@@ er Islands ( French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia ) , is the last British territory of the South Pacific , half@@ way between New Zealand and Chile .
This territory includes 47 k@@ m@@ 2 , with three other small islands .
He has been British since his occupation in 17@@ 90 by the mutilation of Bou@@ na@@ ty , an episo@@ de in the history of the English na@@ vy , which resulted in three Hol@@ ly@@ wood adap@@ tations .
A few dozen people , most of the des@@ c@@ endants of Bou@@ na@@ ty muti@@ l@@ é , still live P@@ it@@ c@@ a@@ r@@ in , and their incomes depend on 95 % of London &apos;s generosity .
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of creating a marine reserve around the small archi@@ pe@@ l@@ ago , or 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone .
A deputy to the May@@ or of the island went to London asking Britain to valid@@ ate this request .
Mi@@ ke W@@ arre@@ en , the may@@ or of P@@ it@@ ha@@ r@@ in , believes that creating such a protected zone would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island .
The project must be accepted by the English govern@@ or of Pit@@ c@@ air@@ r@@ n , resident in New Zealand , and by the British Government .
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to sanc@@ tu@@ ari@@ ze these 8@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 k@@ m@@ 2 , provided , however , that it has the means to monitor it , which is not the case .
There are no airport in Pit@@ c@@ air@@ r@@ n , which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance in the area , and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are placed .
As for France , it already has to lead the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million k@@ m@@ 2 of the E@@ E@@ Z of French Pol@@ y@@ ne@@ sia , a neighbour of P@@ it@@ ka@@ r@@ n .

P@@ ris@@ on life for a former Chinese deputy govern@@ or
A former deputy govern@@ or of the province of Ji@@ in , in nor@@ theast China , was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption .
The Communist Party in July 2012 , Ti@@ an X@@ u@@ er@@ en was accused of affecting more than 19 million y@@ u@@ ans of bri@@ bes , reporting China ’ s official media .
Between 1995 and 2001 , the Deputy Govern@@ or , who was also President of the Bank of Ji@@ in , a public establishment , helped and is responsible for obtaining contracts , loans or promo@@ tions in exchange for money or gi@@ fts , declared the first intermediate court in Beijing on its micro@@ phone .
President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping , who took office last March , made the fight against corruption a national priority , believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party itself .
If the Head of State promised that justice would also be in@@ trac@@ table with the powerful &apos; tig@@ ers &apos; than with the &apos; m@@ ou@@ ths &apos; - sub@@ ser@@ vi@@ ent officials - only a handful of senior officials have been convicted .
The most spectacular recent case was the former CC@@ P leader in Ch@@ ong@@ q@@ ing , B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai , who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office within the state .
But the government has not shown any intention of reforming the anti-@@ corruption system by creating , for example , an independent party body .
Two Y@@ M@@ A employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , at a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission .
Two W@@ M@@ A employees in South Wales have been accused of sexual assa@@ ults on children following allegations made against Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h &apos;s educ@@ ator , J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord , in 2011 , at a hearing of the Ro@@ yal Commission responsible for sexual abuse of children .
In his opening statement to the Commission , however , the Y@@ M@@ A said that it &apos; never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children in its organisation &apos; .
Director-General Ph@@ illi@@ p Ha@@ re was asked about two cases : a Y@@ M@@ A employee was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical education instruc@@ tor of Y@@ M@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h H@@ all was convicted of sexual assa@@ ults on children in the centre where he worked in 1991 .
Mr Ha@@ re said to the Commission that he had been informed of the first case , and that he was not aware of the second case .
He also admitted that the opening declaration of the Y@@ M@@ A was in@@ accurate by pointing out , &apos; external controls of the EM@@ A were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organisation &apos; .
It has been demonstrated before the Commission that the Y@@ M@@ C@@ A had been informed that it had received the most mis@@ judgement on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communic@@ ations carried out in August this year .
Mr Ha@@ re , who began working on the Y@@ M@@ A at the age of 21 , admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and failed to check that employees knew they were obliged to report any breaches of child safety policy .
Ear@@ lier this year , Lord L@@ ord was sentenced for sexual assault on 12 boys during the two years that he worked on the Y@@ M@@ A .
He has been sentenced to a sentence of six years of a minimum prison .
But Mr Ha@@ re rejected the idea that Y@@ M@@ A would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord &apos;s failings on child safety .
The staff have shown that they have observed certain shortcomings , in particular the fact that Lord L@@ ord remained alone with children , kept them in private , made them sit on his k@@ nees , told them that he loved them and left them to play with his mobile phone .
Dan@@ i@@ le O@@ ck@@ well , who was controlled by Lord and asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour , indicated that she found the head of Y@@ M@@ A Car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h , J@@ ac@@ h Bar@@ na@@ at , who would be very intimid@@ ating and difficult to approach most of the time .
The Director-General said that he rejected the testi@@ monies of staff that they were reluctant to point out these failings to their superi@@ ors .
Instead , he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have bl@@ ur@@ red their judgment , which means that they have not reported his actions .
Mr Ha@@ re said that he had expressed his point of view before the South Wales council of the South saying that , for the organisation , the lesson of the &apos; J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord incident &apos; should not concern the staff , and the Council agreed with him .
Mr Ha@@ re said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreements to staff , shortly after the allegations were made , was taken by the Director General of the Y@@ M@@ A responsible for childcare , Li@@ am Wh@@ it@@ ley .
He said that this decision was intended to prevent any contamination of evidence , but that it was an &apos; excess of ze@@ al &apos; and had been poorly implemented .
The South Wales was not a safe organisation for children at a time when J@@ on@@ a@@ than Lord was employed there , that is , between 2009 and 2011 , the expert on sexual violence on children , Professor Ste@@ ph@@ en S@@ m@@ all@@ b@@ one from G@@ ri@@ ff@@ ith University in the Commission .
He said that there are &apos; serious problems &apos; in recruitment , control , initi@@ ation , training and supervision of staff .
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister , but recognize that his return is unlikely .
In an interview last night marking the 5@@ th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office , the 59 year-old man gave his opinion on various national policies .
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade leading the country , Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy , limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special En@@ voy for the Middle East peace process .
When he was asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister , Mr Blair would have replied , according to the London Stand@@ ard : yes , but it may happen , so ...
When many fac@@ t-@@ finding experts met in Cardiff in order to confront and win the trop@@ y of the year ’ s Ch@@ ev@@ al , they knew that competition would be harsh .
But no one expected to see F@@ en@@ on Kyrgyzstan , a three-@@ year-old child .
Not at school , and only a few months after it was first weapons , the small and his She@@ t@@ land T@@ off@@ e@@ e cl@@ out ran through the three rounds with great ease and won the first price , leaving behind the 30 other adult competitors .
The two in@@ separ@@ able – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation , attitude , and style at the annual contest that took place at the center of S@@ un@@ n@@ y@@ bank in R@@ ud@@ ary near Cardiff .
To stand up against men and women in e@@ leg@@ ant m@@ el@@ es@@ is , he had his h@@ at cap@@ tured a little on the side in a dis@@ contr@@ acted way to dis@@ pose of his 2 year-old T@@ our@@ e@@ e T@@ ask .
The judges were gre@@ eted by judges for their un@@ common natural qualities for a child of his age .
And T@@ off@@ e received very good notes for his presentation and his personality .
F@@ en@@ on had a gift for his 3@@ th birth@@ day last March , and has been taking place since his She@@ t@@ land pon@@ der every day .
His mother Don@@ a , 30 years , said : ‘ F@@ en@@ on and T@@ off@@ e are doing an excellent du@@ o ’ .
They stood against and against all , but both have dra@@ gged the gold and ro@@ ck cut .
It was only the second time that he was living with T@@ off@@ e@@ e and we were happy to win .
People who did not know that it was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to photo@@ grap@@ h with him .
This young bo@@ y , from the village of N@@ an@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near E@@ ub@@ w V@@ ale , in southern Wales , is following the foot@@ steps of his leader Sharon H@@ ow@@ el@@ ls , who has been involved in ten@@ ders for more than 10 years .
Mrs Howitt said : &apos; There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applau@@ ded it &apos; .
He went through the whole story and even if he seemed to be small , he did a wonderful job .
F@@ on is cra@@ zy of animals – it love hor@@ ses , tr@@ actors , and rural world , and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens .
The way in which he began , he will soon be taking part in the Ch@@ ev@@ al of the year – and I am sure he will do a good job .
A spokes@@ person for the annual em@@ ail said : ‘ F@@ en@@ on is only three years , but he knows how to conduct his pon@@ der ’ .
They are a good team .
The judges have noticed that F@@ en@@ on and T@@ off@@ e are well presented and the way they mar@@ ched on the line .
They are looking for effective team work between the pon@@ der and the tra@@ der – F@@ en@@ on and T@@ off@@ e have been the best on the line .
I am sure his beautiful clo@@ thes helped F@@ en@@ on , he really was proud .
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal &apos; will be recast &apos; .
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-@@ page call for the release of a journalist accused of def@@ am@@ ation will be re@@ pai@@ red , declare a press regulator .
The New Ex@@ press based in Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou .
But Mr Ch@@ en later admitted on television that he accepted bri@@ bes to make stories about a semi-@@ public society .
Now the New Ex@@ press is going to undergo a &apos; complete overhaul &apos; .
The order of &apos; res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le &apos; comes from the administration of Gu@@ ang@@ don for Pres@@ ca and E@@ di@@ tion , Rad@@ io , F@@ il@@ m and Tele@@ vision .
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Ex@@ press , belonging to the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing Group , had published several er@@ ron@@ eous articles about the listed Z@@ o@@ om@@ lion society between September 2012 and August 2013 .
&apos;@@ The drafting of New Ex@@ press was dis@@ organised &apos; , the regulator said in a statement .
He said he had decided &apos; to impose an administrative penalty on Ch@@ en Y@@ ong@@ z@@ h@@ ou by withdrawing his press map &apos; .
He has also &quot; ordered the Y@@ ang@@ ch@@ en@@ g E@@ ven@@ ing Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Ex@@ press , and recommended that he investigate those responsible in New Ex@@ press and immediately re@@ press the newspaper &apos;s management team &quot; .
Mr Ch@@ en wrote several articles for the New Ex@@ press on the alleged financial irregularities of a shipy@@ ard manufacturer called Z@@ o@@ om@@ li@@ on .
After his arrest , his newspaper issued twice a call on the front page for his release , writing that he supported his journ@@ alism .
But Mr Ch@@ en then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories against money .
&quot; In this case I have damaged Z@@ o@@ om@@ li@@ on and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence &quot; , he said to the public television network C@@ C@@ TV .
I did so mainly because I was running after the money and the cele@@ bri@@ ties .
I have realised that I am wrong .
Following Mr Ch@@ en &apos;s apologies , New Ex@@ press published his apologies on the front page , writing that he had not properly checked his articles .
A number of important suspects have recently made television ad@@ missions .
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their ad@@ missions , despite a change in the law that was voted on earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves .
The aircraft carrier Charles de Gaul@@ le in &apos; un@@ available &apos;
In T@@ oul@@ on , the aircraft carrier is on the run .
The flight of radioactive ste@@ am detected on one of the two nuclear he@@ at@@ ers in Charles de Gaul@@ le in mid-@@ October and when the ship was at sea was &apos; safe for seafarers &apos; , but is not without consequences for the Mar@@ ine .
Indeed , the Ro@@ yal has confirmed to us &apos; the un@@ availability &apos; of the vessel until &apos; mid-@@ November &apos; , &apos; the time to take appropriate corrective measures &apos; on the reactor .
On the other hand , the company , D@@ DR , which is a defence naval company , ensures that his teams and those of A@@ re@@ va , sent to the V@@ ar on the occasion , &apos; are currently on the aircraft carrier &apos; .
It is for them , among other things , to change a p@@ ump on failing heat .
&apos;@@ Everything is being done so that Charles de Gaul@@ le can carry out his planned deployment at the end of 2013 &apos; .
And the national Nav@@ y to certi@@ fy that &apos; this does not call into question the ship &apos; s activities on nuclear pro@@ pul@@ sion .
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaul@@ le is leaving an interim six-month period .
He had built T@@ oul@@ on in mid-@@ October for training .
This , in particular , is to describe young hunting pil@@ ots .
A &apos; small ar@@ ie &apos; , confined to the area of contain@@ ment of the reactor , then occurred on the am@@ ic@@ able ship of the French fleet .
According to the National Mar@@ ine , the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination .
For more than a year , I have been able to see a strong dis@@ content from the people I meet : mon@@ str@@ ous re@@ valuation of their properties , tax breaks , the cost of permits of all kinds , administrative costs .
In short , we have no limit in our pockets .
Mil@@ lions of squ@@ an@@ dered dollars could be saved to allow a tax that is much respectful of those who pay .
Any money taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impover@@ ishment .
In Sh@@ aw@@ ini@@ g@@ an , despite the closure of all major companies , we are not bo@@ thering about s@@ om@@ pling expenditure and maintaining lame duc@@ ks : a deficit of culture , strong subsidies to Energy Energy , etc .
If these facilities are not profitable , they are sold to private companies or they are being dem@@ ol@@ ished .
It is also sad to see the ex@@ propri@@ ation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come .
However , I have an honourable mention of the transformation of former W@@ ab@@ ass@@ o into a kind of industrial inc@@ ub@@ ator , but how much cost to tax pay@@ ers ?
It is not up to the public to invest in such companies , but to the private sector on the basis of consumer demand .
The citizens were pleased to learn that the la@@ kes in the Fisheries and Pi@@ es will continue to supply the city with drinking water .
Following the departure of all industries ( large water users ) and the major decline in the population , the use of water has fallen considerably across the territory .
Without wishing to waste it , the city will never fail , and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly watered down .
In short , it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others .
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet .
With a gross debt of more than $ 200 million , this city is no longer able to buy a fa@@ it without a borrowing regulation .
For more than 40 years , we have been in operation for more than 40 years with fine diplomas , and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse .
O@@ ut@@ ness of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tun@@ n@@ els for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico , with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electrical ra@@ ils , has been discovered .
The US authorities described the tunnel by 4 feet per 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they had ever seen .
The tunnel , zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag@@ er on a length of six long football fields , links w@@ are@@ houses near Ti@@ ju@@ ana , Mexico , San Di@@ e@@ go , the United States .
The area is full of un@@ workable w@@ are@@ houses , which makes it easy to conceal drug tr@@ uc@@ ks .
The tunnel was closed before drugs came out of it un@@ noticed , declared the authorities .
The authorities seized 8@@ .5 tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 k@@ g of co@@ c@@ ain@@ e after the tunnel was discovered , according to judicial cases .
Three men who , according to the authorities , were working as drivers , were accused of possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ c@@ ain@@ e with intention to sell .
They run a prison sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted .
In No@@ g@@ ales , Ari@@ z@@ ona , traffickers exploit vast underground dra@@ in@@ age channels .
The tunnel is the eigh@@ th important passage in San Di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
Some of the biggest tun@@ n@@ els were discovered following the mari@@ ju@@ ana harvest in the centre of Mexico in October , posing a challenge for the drug car@@ t@@ els that must quickly deliver their products to consumers .
In 2010 , the authorities found a passage of around 700 y@@ ards with railways from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en of a Ti@@ j@@ ana house and went up to two w@@ are@@ houses in San Di@@ e@@ go .
The British police issued an extradition mandate against Ass@@ ange
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the foun@@ der of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks Ju@@ li@@ an Ass@@ ange , who took refuge in the Ecu@@ ador Ambassador in London and called for political asylum .
Scotland Y@@ ard said she had issued a “ surrender opinion ” against Austr@@ ali@@ an for 40 years , asking him to come to a police commission , adding that if he did not , he could be arrested .
Ass@@ ange could be extra@@ d@@ ited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime , after having exhausted all possible aven@@ ues under British law after the Supreme Court invali@@ dated its appeal against its extradition at the beginning of this month .
As a result of Stockholm allowing its transfer to the United States , he found refuge in the Ecu@@ ador Em@@ bas@@ ade in London on 19 June , asking that South American country for political asylum .
S@@ co@@ t@@ land Y@@ ard &apos; issued an opinion against a 4@@ 0-@@ year-old man asking him to come to a police office , on the date and time of his choice &apos; , declared a spokesman .
It continues to violate the conditions for its release under b@@ ail .
The Ambassador refused to comment on the issue of issuing the opinion by the police .
Ass@@ ange fears being extra@@ d@@ ited from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of sp@@ ying , having un@@ ve@@ iled more than 250 000 US diplomatic c@@ ables on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks site fighting secret information .
How Bi@@ ome@@ try is going to inv@@ ade our lives
Fin@@ i has the words to ta@@ p into his or her s@@ ample or pay his purchases ?
American , French or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by biometric cap@@ tors and computers .
Ber@@ n@@ ard Di@@ di@@ er , the Deputy Man@@ aging Director of Mor@@ ph@@ o , even believes that “ the century will be biometric . ”
Only biome@@ tr@@ ics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a uni@@ verse and transnational uni@@ verse than the Internet .
The organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this exc@@ itement for biome@@ tr@@ ics , but they are concerned about it .
In 2011 and France alone , the National Information and Freedom Commission authorised 7@@ 74 systems for the recognition of fingerprints , the form of the hand or the ho@@ ly network of hand in companies , administrations , can@@ te@@ ens ...
&apos;@@ Everyone can soon be identified , wherever and whenever &apos; , is in Washington , responsible for the privacy of consumers in the CD@@ C ( C@@ enter for Democracy and Technology ) , in Washington .
The reasons for such optimism , among some , and pessimis@@ m , among others ?
Bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ics will be based on new techniques , which will enable new services to be made available to citizens and consumers .
Today , in France , the most widely used biometric data are finger@@ printing , the tr@@ ick of the hand , and the v@@ int@@ age network of the p@@ ause or fin@@ gers .
But each of these techniques has its constraints .
&apos;@@ For example , some people who work on concrete have their fin@@ gers and their fingerprints un@@ mis@@ ta@@ kable &apos; , noted Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , the technical director of the identity area in Th@@ ales Communic@@ ations and Security .
And the collection and the verification of the ho@@ ly network and the hand of the hand require a voluntary and precise gesture from the people .
It is both a security - we cannot collect this data at all - and one draw@@ back : the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time .
As a result , research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches , such as recognition of face or i@@ ice ( the col@@ our@@ ful part of the eye ) .
With the increase in the accuracy of sen@@ ators and the ability to calculate the computers required for data analysis , these techniques become operational .
The prec@@ ision of fac@@ ial recognition has increased ten@@ fold over the past five years , cal@@ med Cy@@ r@@ ill@@ le B@@ at@@ ller , the director of R &amp; D in Europe .
With our help , the UK and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border cross@@ ings using fac@@ ial recognition .
It is now possible to identify a face or an i@@ ice on the move .
&apos;@@ Today we are carrying out research into the recognition of the voice or the way to walk with noise cap@@ tors , but we need a silent environment &apos; , indicating S@@ ri@@ d@@ ha@@ r I@@ y@@ eng@@ ar , the head of security research to In@@ tel L@@ ab@@ s .
A single and inf@@ alli@@ ble issue , DNA also raises hopes and concerns .
&apos;@@ At the present stage of knowledge , it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data &apos; , confirms S@@ op@@ hi@@ -@@ T@@ ul@@ li@@ -@@ T@@ a@@ ver@@ ard , Director of the studies , innovation and the prospec@@ tive to C@@ N@@ I@@ L .
But DNA analysis is still very long and costly .
E@@ Q@@ A offers the judicial police services a value costing EUR 9@@ 0@@ ,000 to analyse DNA s@@ amples in the place of a crime and in one hour .
Bi@@ ome@@ try uses are divided into two groups : identification ( recognition of one person among others ) and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation ( ensuring that the person is the one it claims to be ) .
The identification hitherto concerned the issue of identity papers : the biometric data ( fingerprints , photo@@ grap@@ h , i@@ is ) have to be confronted with the information that the state has on all the citizens already on board .
This makes it possible to ensure that someone does not try to u@@ sur@@ p someone else &apos;s identity .
This principle of comparison may have other applications .
In this way , it is proposed that V@@ IV be recognised as a ho@@ tel or shop .
&apos;@@ We will take the pictures of the surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and compare them with the photo@@ graph@@ s of cele@@ bri@@ ties circul@@ ating freely on the Internet &apos; , explains Dan@@ y N@@ as@@ f , who is responsible , in N@@ EC France , for commercial development for biometric identification solutions .
Another use : to take the photo@@ grap@@ h a qu@@ e@@ ue that is qu@@ eu@@ ing in a shop , to follow its progress through face recognition and to calculate the waiting time .
The auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation concerned physical access ( borders , protected premises , can@@ te@@ ens ... ) or logic ( opening of a computer ) .
More recently , there has been control of attendance .
&apos;@@ A biome@@ tr@@ ical str@@ ing avoi@@ ds the phenomenon of the cop@@ y that is pointing out for another &apos; , justi@@ fying Cy@@ r@@ r@@ le B@@ at@@ ller .
But , increasingly , auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ation will also concern transactions , especially those made from connected devices to the Internet .
In Japan , it is already possible to take money away from certain distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric read@@ er : this is re@@ places the secret code .
A similar techni@@ que is tested at V@@ ill@@ en@@ t d &apos;@@ A@@ sc@@ q and An@@ g@@ us@@ a@@ sia by Nat@@ ural Security Society in partnership with banks and large distribution teachers : when paying a shop with its banking card , the customer does not ta@@ p his code , but put his finger on a read@@ er who scan@@ ns the cal@@ ves .
The experiment is planned to last six months .
If it is successful , biometric read@@ ers could soon reach French retailers .
P@@ lan@@ ts to reassure users of users
There are three ways of making biome@@ tr@@ ics attractive to the general public .
The first is to explain that it can save time .
&apos;@@ If , thanks to biome@@ tr@@ ics , a customer remains in the chair 30 seconds less , it is good &apos; , explains the director of a large area .
The second is to offer person@@ alized services : in a few years &apos; time , a voice ser@@ ver will be able to recognise your voice and propose tail@@ or-@@ made options .
And , finally , reassuring by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases .
&apos;@@ fingerprints are stored on a first ser@@ ver ; people &apos;s identities are in a second base : the correlation between the two numbers is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted and stored in a highly secure box , which is blocked if attempts are made to move it &apos; , lists Phili@@ p@@ pe Rob@@ in , Th@@ ales .
But , without thorough studies , it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users .
Com@@ pan@@ ies for the protection of privacy continue to worry .
&apos;@@ The progress of Con@@ di@@ tional recognition , the multi@@ plic@@ ation of surveillance cam@@ er@@ as and the huge amount of photo@@ s available on Fac@@ e@@ book , F@@ lic@@ k@@ r or Pi@@ ca@@ sa , make me fear the worst : widespread surveillance &apos; , predicted by An@@ drew Pat@@ rick , of the Consumer Protection Commissioner in Canada .
A driver travelling at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink between the leg@@ s has been charged with 1 000 p@@ ounds .
A car was charged with a fine of £ 1 000 for driving at 2@@ 10 km / h with a hot drink between his leg@@ s .
An@@ drew H@@ ow@@ e , 35 years from Ti@@ tre@@ e in Es@@ sex , was re@@ pen@@ ted driving his Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es Ben@@ z on A@@ 120 to B@@ ain@@ tre@@ e on 27 May .
When the police arrested him , they discovered the drink to be won between his leg@@ s .
In the Court of First In@@ stance of Co@@ ch@@ ester , H@@ ow@@ e admitted that conduct would be infringement without due care and attention .
The seven points removed from its permit led to a 6 months withdrawal .
H@@ ow@@ e has also been condemned to pay costs amounting to GBP 90 and an extra tax for the victim of £ 100 .
A tax on foreign home@@ owners
The Treasury has provisi@@ onally quanti@@ fied the capital gains tax measure , but awaiting a final decision by Mr Os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 budget , has included a 7 % stam@@ p right for properties costing more than GBP 2 and annual costs for bu@@ yers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually .
P@@ he@@ ap law already applies to residential properties in the West@@ min@@ ster and Ken@@ s@@ ington &amp; Ch@@ ell@@ a distric@@ ts , and represents 7@@ 08 M in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , north-@@ east , nor@@ th@@ west , and the Yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and H@@ um@@ ber region .
Mr Co@@ ok said : &apos; Following the increase in the right of stamp on high-@@ value properties and the introduction of the anti-@@ prevention law in this area , it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are under-@@ tax@@ ed regardless of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system . &apos;
“ But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners who are reluctant to sell , ” he added .
R@@ is@@ k housing – the 5 to 10 % of the highest prices in the housing market – in the prosperous sector in the south-@@ west of London that stret@@ ches from F@@ ul@@ ham to W@@ im@@ b@@ ed@@ on , increased by a record figure of 11.@@ 8 % last year .
P@@ ric@@ es in the centre of London grow regular growth year by 5.@@ 6 % , but have been over@@ shad@@ owed by a growing “ internal market , ” the sou@@ th@@ west of the city , the north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and the rest ( 6@@ .5 % ) , according to S@@ av@@ ill@@ s studies .
Scienti@@ sts have just highlighted the way in which the qu@@ e@@ ue movements of a dog are linked to its mood .
Pre@@ vious studies had revealed that happy dogs were sending their qu@@ e@@ ue to the right ( from the dog ’ s point of view ) , while ner@@ ve dogs took it further to the left .
But scientists now say that dogs can detect these sub@@ tle differences and respond .
Professor Georgi@@ o V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neuro@@ science at T@@ ren@@ te University , said : “ Everyone knows that , in man , the left side and the right of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimul@@ i that ar@@ ouse positive or negative emotions . ”
Here we have tried to see what it was in other species .
He added that , as in man , in dogs the right of the brain is responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa , and that the two hemis@@ p@@ here played a different role in emotions .
To learn more about how dogs respond to other dogs ’ dis@@ orderly qu@@ ay movements , researchers followed animals watching films where other dogs were .
They have measured the heart frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour .
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes go on one side and sometimes on the other .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ We have presented films with films from other dogs – either a nat@@ ur@@ alist version or a sil@@ ver to avoid any other factors of confusion – and we have been able to ta@@ p the qu@@ e@@ ue and present it as more to the left or right . ”
When the animals saw a dog without an expression of an expression to the right ( from the point of view of the dog flying the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , they remained completely rela@@ xed .
But when they have s@@ atur@@ ated a qu@@ e@@ ue mainly to the left ( once again from the point of view of the dog flying the qu@@ e@@ ue ) , their heart frequency accelerated and they were anxious .
Professor V@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communic@@ ating between them through these movements .
Instead , it believes that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about .
He added : &apos; If you meet with other dogs , and if you notice that , most of the time , the movement of their qu@@ e@@ ues to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side has a less friendly attitude , you will react to that experience . &apos;
Res@@ ear@@ chers indicate that the results could enable owners , ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arians and d@@ wel@@ lers to better understand the emotions of their animals .
The expert expert John Bra@@ d@@ sha@@ w , a prof@@ essor at the University of B@@ ris@@ to@@ l University University , said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and the right in the can@@ ine species .
Last year , a L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n University team discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and the right when it was a jo@@ y@@ ful dog .
And , in another scientific study carried out by Vic@@ tor@@ ia University in Canada , he said : “ dogs went more easily to a ro@@ ot dog when its qu@@ e@@ ue w@@ ins to the left rather than to the right , instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study . ”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not entirely consider animals of films or ro@@ bo@@ ts like dogs .
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could be useful , he explained .
“ Although many elements , found in different ma@@ m@@ m@@ als , indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes , many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception , ” he said .
However , given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered , it will certainly not take long before we understand why their qu@@ e@@ ues sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other .
Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ k@@ ey@@ s rec@@ ou@@ ped a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w because of Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner disease
The Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ k@@ ey@@ s Group has postponed a concer@@ t in G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w after a lyn@@ ch has been diagno@@ sed with his sing@@ er .
The S@@ him@@ ld group had to take on Friday in the concer@@ t H@@ y@@ ti@@ o in the town city .
However , his lyn@@ ch forced the sing@@ er Ale@@ x Tur@@ ner to re@@ programme the spectac@@ le .
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concer@@ t to the L@@ G A@@ ren@@ a of Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham on Thursday .
In a statement on their official site , Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ k@@ ey@@ s said : &apos; Following the decision to postpone the concer@@ t to Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham in Bir@@ min@@ g@@ ham this evening and after requesting medical advice , Ar@@ ti@@ c Mon@@ k@@ ey@@ s must also postpone the spectac@@ le to G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w de G@@ l@@ as@@ go@@ w on Friday 1 November . &apos;

The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will name his first Car@@ din@@ s in February
The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will appoint new Car@@ din@@ s of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February , announced the V@@ a@@ tic@@ an on Thursday .
Car@@ din@@ ins are the top church men in the Catholic Church behind the Pope , and those who elect it , so Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor .
At present , there is 20@@ 1 Car@@ d@@ in@@ au@@ x .
However , as soon as a Car@@ d@@ inal reaches the age of 80 , he can no longer participate in the election of a Pope – that is a group of 120 “ voters . ”
In a statement announcing the news , Fa@@ ther F@@ eder@@ ic@@ o Lom@@ b@@ ar@@ di , a V@@ a@@ tic@@ an spokesman , said that a meeting of all the existing card@@ din@@ ans would be held before the ceremony , during which b@@ ish@@ ops will be raised to the dignity of Car@@ d@@ inal , known as con@@ spir@@ acy .
&apos;@@ The Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is has decided to communicate his decision to conven@@ e the February con@@ spir@@ acy in advance to facilitate planning for other meetings requiring the participation of car@@ din@@ ins in various parts of the world &apos; , said Lom@@ bar@@ di .
J@@ ack V@@ ill@@ o of the Catholic Vo@@ es said that by February the number of voters in the street will probably have decreased .
He said that a Pope generally called as many car@@ din@@ als as it was needed to ensure that the number of voters in the street is 120 and as many car@@ din@@ ans over 80 as he wanted .
The con@@ spir@@ acy of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of the Pope Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is in March of this year .
At the moment , there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe , especially Italy .
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will name Car@@ din@@ s in the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he added .
40 % of Roman Ca@@ thol@@ ics live in South America , but a small number of car@@ din@@ als represent them .
Car@@ din@@ ins will also be the first to be chosen since Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is formed the Car@@ d@@ inal Council , a group of eight Car@@ din@@ s from all over the world who are responsible for examining ways of reforming the church .
Pre@@ viously , the Pope decided on everything alone .
“ Now , Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is chose these eight Car@@ din@@ s to help him , ” explained V@@ ill@@ er@@ o .
He added that it was &apos; perfectly possible &apos; that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is asked for advice .
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new .
Val@@ er@@ o pointed out that the Pope usually sto@@ res b@@ ish@@ ops representing large communities as a Car@@ d@@ inal , but that Fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is was “ full of sur@@ prises , so we do not know who he will appoint . ”
GM rec@@ alls some of its new pic@@ k@@ ub@@ ps
General Mo@@ tors C@@ o rec@@ alls almost 19 000 of his new , Ch@@ ev@@ ro@@ l@@ et Sil@@ ver@@ ado , and G@@ M@@ C Sierra 2014 , to deal with a problem with pe@@ tty issues , according to a Friday statement of the US body responsible for regulating vehicle safety .
On some p@@ ick@@ w@@ ps , the seats before could present a default in the pe@@ tty mechanism .
As a result , cases do not meet the federal safety standards of vehicles concerning e-@@ support .
&apos;@@ If the vehicle is per@@ me@@ ated by the back door , it may well be that the head@@ guard does not adequately protect passengers , thus increasing the risk of injury &apos; , according to the statement on the National High@@ way Tra@@ ffic Safety ( N@@ H@@ T@@ SA ) site .
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September .
The deployment of GM pic@@ k@@ u@@ ps began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009 .
GM informed the owners of the default peak in the first half of October .
N@@ H@@ T@@ SA was unable to examine the letter of information to the owners because of the 16 days of government activities , which slow@@ ed down the growth in vehicle sales in October .
The sales of pic@@ k@@ um@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and Sierra , which were re@@ drawn for the 2014 model , increased by about 20 % in the first 10 months of the year , declared G@@ M Friday .
In October , GM has sold 42 6@@ 60 p@@ ick@@ w@@ ps Sil@@ ver@@ ado and 16 50@@ 3 p@@ ick@@ w@@ ps Sierra .
The price of GM actions rose by 1.@@ 4 % to $ 3@@ 7.@@ 47 at the New York Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change on Friday afternoon .

A construction worker is killed in dozens of concrete blocks , on Thursday mid@@ day , in Mon@@ tre@@ al .
The tragedy took place at 11 a.m. on the Mar@@ qu@@ et street , close to the inter@@ section on the Be@@ au@@ t street , in the r@@ oun@@ d-@@ up of Ros@@ em@@ on@@ t-@@ La Pe@@ ti@@ -@@ Patri@@ e .
In all probability , work on foundations has been taking place there for some time .
A bitter wall of foundation had just been built in the last few days .
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had just arrived on the shipy@@ ard to recover its tools .
I was travelling by car and saw the wall collap@@ sing with a large smoke cl@@ oud , said Sy@@ l@@ vain Jean , who remains close to the shipy@@ ard .
I am lan@@ ded and I went to remove the big b@@ ric@@ ks that would recover it .
There was only one side of his back , that is so unfortunate .
According to the authorities , the victim is an elderly man in the fif@@ ties who worked for a pig company .
E@@ sti@@ m@@ ates of re@@ anim@@ ation were tried by emergency services , but without success .
The man has not survived his serious injuries .
A Commission health and safety inspec@@ tor has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy .
Obama \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s vo@@ ter of desper@@ ation
I voted twice for President Obama - believe in the possibility of a change in change .
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts by the Republican Party ’ s obstruc@@ tion@@ ism .
Ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism does not excuse the difficulties of the Ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are site or attacks on d@@ ron@@ es
The memory of Obama ’ s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened .
N@@ a@@ ath@@ el P@@ . Mor@@ ris is student in the 2@@ th year of medical medicine at Har@@ v@@ ard .
I am reading a pain@@ fully sad book in recent days .
It was a book which , I thought , would encourage me during the sha@@ m of the 2@@ th year of medicine and restore hope .
It is called the Au@@ to to W@@ in , and it is the m@@ emo@@ irs of Barack Obama ’ s presidential campaign of 2008 .
When I finish the medical records of my patients in the evening and myself , this book won me at the time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches could cut you off .
The election ended with an overwhelming victory , and presen@@ t-@@ day newspapers took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment .
My com@@ ra@@ des were happy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found .
A young team of vision@@ aries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change .
During Obama ’ s transition period before he took office in 2008 , he had 82 % fav@@ orable opinions .
And then I close the book .
Re@@ turning to the present is a difficult aw@@ ak@@ ening . It is like getting out of a dream .
It is difficult to remember these days of optimism , as distant memories , a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past .
The change has actually occurred in the years following the first time I voted .
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined .
I put great achievements to Obama from the passage of the Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act to the departure of Iraq from our army to the end of the &apos; neither seen nor known &apos; and the assassination of Os@@ ama bin Laden .
Furthermore , I believe that partisan obstruc@@ tion@@ ism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the field of immigration reforms , public health care and the closure of Guantánamo , among other things .
But , having repeatedly defended Obama ’ s administration against my pe@@ ers and my colleagues , I am unable to provide explanations .
I am on the ver@@ ge of political despair .
The Republican ob@@ struction cannot explain the foreign leaders ’ att@@ achment , or the attacks of innocent foreign children by d@@ ron@@ es .
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the privacy of the Americans , nor the indic@@ tment of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers who reveal the wron@@ g@@ doing of the government .
It cannot justify the murder of An@@ war al-@@ A@@ w@@ la@@ ki , an American citizen , without trial , or the evasion of public funding and the over@@ spending of authorised expenditure during presidential campaigns .
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the &apos; most aggressive ... since Ni@@ xon &apos;s administration &apos; .
And , more recently , it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website for more than three years after the A@@ f@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act has been ratified .
I do not know if that is what I expected .
If , at 18 years , I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it .
Of course , the electoral function is not predictable , because the opposition political party and the events that occur by chance , such as the New@@ ton massacre , are influen@@ cing our public convers@@ ation .
However , all the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration .
That is what distur@@ bs me most .
I voted again for Obama in 2012 , but not because I was enthusiastic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney had a confused and un@@ refin@@ ed alternative , which did not seem to be able to determine his policies or positions .
I believed that Obama , elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections , would deliver the promises that we had been talking about for so long .
Yet , while the fav@@ orable opinion index has fallen below 45 % this week , it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book .
I am sorry about the many promises that have been made .
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania Pri@@ may@@ ors .
At a post-@@ campaign meeting , he told his team that they had to get back on the right track and remain faithful to their cause .
&apos;@@ I want us to focus on our talent &apos; .
We have to remember who we are .
We are five years later , Mr President , and I do not agree with you .
The views expressed in this comment are only those of N@@ a@@ ath@@ el Mor@@ ris .
On Friday , at 3 p.m. , a violent col@@ lis@@ ion between a mo@@ to and a car took place in Re@@ st@@ é@@ l@@ ne in F@@ er@@ er@@ on .
The mo@@ ver , J@@ on@@ a@@ than , 26 years from F@@ l@@ é@@ on , was no cast@@ er .
Despite rapid relief intervention , he died in this fron@@ tal col@@ lis@@ ion .
C@@ li@@ ve Pal@@ mer claims that Mr Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system .
The bil@@ li@@ on@@ aire MEP C@@ li@@ ve Pal@@ mer argues that Prime Minister Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his girls could be pregnant and benefit from this system .
The mining mag@@ net , which con@@ tests the payment of a carbon tax of an amount of USD 6 , has made this argument in order to try to remove questions about a possible conflict .
The Pal@@ mer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be abolished .
But Mr Pal@@ mer said that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s girls were prepared to benefit personally from these policies .
&quot; It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave , because if one of his d@@ augh@@ ters is pregnant , he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave &quot; .
Two months after its election , the electoral commission officially declared that Mr Pal@@ mer won the seat of S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast of F@@ ai@@ fa@@ x by 53 votes after re@@ counting .
Mr Pal@@ mer has put forward the idea of a res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le of votes to speed up the process .
The girls of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t , Fre@@ es and Bri@@ d@@ g@@ let .
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over ?
“ We need a better system , ” he said .
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter , use your co-@@ ordin@@ ation in a computer , vote immediately and have the result at 6.@@ 30 p.m. the next morning ?
Mr Pal@@ mer has also criticised the use of paper paper to mark the ballot papers .
Is it to be able to er@@ ase the result if someone does not agree ?
Today , having a paper paper seems extraordinary .
The Elec@@ toral Commission has studied possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand .
Mr Pal@@ mer , 59 years , said that his political project included an international airport for the S@@ un@@ sh@@ ine Co@@ ast and that he would take his new role &apos; very seriously &apos; .
The exercise of public functions is a public service issue .
“ We are not seeking a reward , except the reward for history , because we must serve the community at a critical moment , ” he added .
A team of bi@@ olog@@ ists led by the Wil@@ d@@ life Corpor@@ ation Society in New York has identified a new species of d@@ ust dol@@ ph@@ in off Australia &apos;s northern coast .
Th@@ y@@ b@@ au@@ x , responsible for a scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for the Conser@@ vation and A@@ tal@@ ess of Am@@ ills and M@@ loc@@ ks Mar@@ ins ( O@@ C@@ EM@@ M@@ M ) is for the Ex@@ press on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species .
Is the discovery of this new type of d@@ ust dol@@ ph@@ in surprising ?
That is good news , but I am not particularly surprised .
If , in the past , species have been described and identified on mor@@ pho@@ logical , an@@ atomic and geographical grounds , today the development of new tools such as gene@@ tics enables us to improve our knowledge of species classification science .
Moreover , it is not possible for this progress in genetic engineering and m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ ology to call into question the classification or membership of a species , a family or even an order .
At the beginning of the nineteenth century , mor@@ ho@@ olog@@ ists classified animals , based on the mor@@ pho@@ logical differences between species .
Today , some of these ran@@ kings are being called into question as a result of genetic progress .
Similarly , two species very close to mor@@ pho@@ logically have been distinguished from genetic engineering .
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified .
Ten years ago , the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-@@ family : the Pacific dol@@ ph@@ ins and the Atlantic wh@@ ales in the Atlantic .
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish between four species .
Why is this a discovery of importance , as the Wil@@ d@@ life Conser@@ vation Society has said ?
From a conservation point of view , it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect species and thus its genetic vari@@ ability .
If this population had already been known for a long time by researchers , they did not know that it was part of a new species , only in that place .
Therefore , if a massive death problem caused by a vir@@ al epidemic or acci@@ dental catch occurs in the region , we could be dealing with the extinc@@ tion of a species , rather than a local disappearance of a population of a wider species on Earth .
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic .
A species is considered threatened or endangered according to the number of people existing on earth , that is , the stock , and the possibility that it may recover from neighbouring stocks .
With regard to the S@@ kin@@ ch@@ y species , whose population of the new species is out , its stock has automatically become weaker , making it more vulnerable .
Why is it rare to discover new marine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als ?
Mar@@ ine ma@@ m@@ m@@ als are located at the top of the food chain .
They live in homo@@ genous , open habitats , where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals .
This genes of genes limit the creation of new species .
By contrast , more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation , which may eventually lead to the creation of new species .
The marine environment is the least well known environment .
We prefer to send ro@@ bo@@ ts to M@@ ars , to know what lives in the Mari@@ ann@@ es fo@@ e , just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea .
More money is spent on the search for life on other plan@@ ets than in marine research , and it is high time that this changed .
R@@ B@@ S suspended two traders on the exchange market
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its exchange market division according to two sources close to the dossier , which shows once again that the global survey of the suspic@@ ions of currency manipulation is beginning to bear fruit .
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including U@@ B@@ S , Bar@@ cla@@ ys , De@@ ut@@ sch@@ e Bank and R@@ B@@ S , have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world ’ s largest financial market surveys , where USD 5.@@ 3 trillion is changing every day .
The two traders are the first employees of R@@ B@@ S to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation which reflects the scandal of the manipulation of the Li@@ b@@ or inter@@ bank rate .
The bank , which refused to comment on suspen@@ sions , confirmed this month received requests for information from regulators .
&apos;@@ The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are cooperating fully with the F@@ F and other regulators &apos; , and declared a representative of the bank two weeks ago .
Last month , sources close to the dossier declared that R@@ B@@ S had passed on files and in@@ stan@@ tane@@ ous messages , sent to and by a former tra@@ der , the British regulator , the Financial Con@@ ferences Authority .
The tra@@ der , Richard U@@ sh@@ er , left R@@ B@@ S in 2010 , and would have been suspended from his post as a European Sec@@ urities and Ex@@ pl@@ ate T@@ ate in J@@ P@@ Morgan .
Ro@@ h@@ an Ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , who is a European exchange-rate trading officer in C@@ ut@@ i , was left to leave this week , while Ma@@ t Gar@@ d@@ in@@ er , Bar@@ cl@@ ay@@ s , and U@@ B@@ S , was suspended by Stand@@ ard Char@@ ter@@ ed this week .
None of these traders has been subjected to charges .
Mr U@@ sh@@ er &apos;s dossier included in@@ stant messages sent to and by bankers working in Bar@@ cla@@ ys and Ci@@ ti@@ group , adding sources close to the dossier .
U@@ B@@ S explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator , Fin@@ ma , declared that he was investigating suspic@@ ions of currency manipulation in a number of Swiss banks .
In the world , at least six authorities – the European Commission , Fin@@ ma , the Swiss competition authority W@@ k@@ o , the F@@ F , the US Justice Department , and Hong Kong ’ s Monetary Authority – look at the allegations about bankers who would have been agreed to manipul@@ ate rates on the exchange market .
H@@ S@@ BC , Ci@@ ti@@ group , J@@ P@@ Morgan , and C@@ é@@ d@@ is Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators .
B@@ anks p@@ um@@ ble in@@ stant messages and em@@ ail@@ s that have been sent for years to find cases of re@@ prehen@@ sible acts .
The news about these investigations has sha@@ ken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth engines of investment banks in recent years , but which has been challenged this year because of low currency volatility that restricts the opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers tried to minim@@ ize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipul@@ ate the vast liquid exchange market , but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true .
A sen@@ i@@ or tra@@ der said that , despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions , the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use of banks in their own internal platforms “ explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost . ”
The news came on the very day that C@@ r@@ é@@ it Switzerland announced that he had sent a tra@@ der to the London Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change this week after it caused a loss of $ 6 .
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators .
&apos;@@ We are convinced that the tra@@ der has acted alone and that the case has been controlled &apos; , indicated a representative of C@@ r@@ é@@ it Switzerland .
The investigation into May@@ or Ro@@ b Ford was bot@@ tled .
After the police had confirmed that they had set their hands on a video of the video that would show Ro@@ b Ford smo@@ m@@ m@@ ant of the C@@ ick , M@@ ae C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ru@@ by supported never having seen such a bot@@ ched investigation .
R@@ e Ru@@ by said in La Pres@@ se Canad@@ ian that the police had &quot; ignored or minim@@ ized &quot; the evidence against the may@@ or .
On Thursday , the police arrested the occa@@ sional friend and driver of Ro@@ b Ford , Alexander Lis@@ i , who was 35 years old , and accused him of ex@@ tor@@ tion in relation to video .
Alexander Lis@@ i , previously accused of drug trafficking , was in frequent contact with the may@@ or .
The police have said that they have also observed this man issuing par@@ c@@ els in Ro@@ b Ford , indicating new court documents .
Mr Ru@@ by has described the fact that the police have never sear@@ ched the vehicle of Ro@@ b Ford or his home , or are listening to his phone , arguing that the police chief Bill Blair has chosen to be informed of not acting against the may@@ or .
Under the law , the police , having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands , could have inter@@ cep@@ ted Ro@@ b Ford &apos;s vehicle , arrest the may@@ or , and carry out a ra@@ id - even without a mandate .
It could also have called for an in@@ stant search warrant , which was deemed necessary .
The police chief did not comment , but his spokes@@ person Mar@@ k P@@ ash described the words of M@@ e Ru@@ by as &apos; obvious and desperate attempt &apos; to assert himself to the media in a case that does not concern him in any way .
At the press conference on Thursday , Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video which could be &apos; reasonable grounds &apos; which could lead to a criminal accusation against the may@@ or .
Europe ’ s L@@ ess@@ ons in mid-@@ session , except London , except London
With the exception of London , Europe ’ s major stock markets are falling on Friday at mid-@@ sitting , pl@@ agu@@ ed by some news of disappointing companies , while Wall@@ -@@ Street is expected to rise .
On the other hand , investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could un@@ ra@@ vel its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected .
By contrast , after the announcement of inflation at 0.7 % for the eurozone as a whole , the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) could rela@@ x its monetary policy .
The future of Wall Street suggests that America ’ s rising actions will be opened , after two con@@ secu@@ tive meetings .
To values , Rena@@ ult ( 4.@@ 63 % ) has the strongest re@@ treat from CA@@ C 40 , over@@ shad@@ owed by his partner N@@ iss@@ an Mo@@ tor &apos;s warning on Friday .
Ro@@ yal Bank of Scotland ( -@@ 6.@@ 26 % ) marks the worst performance of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 , after having also published down@@ wards results this morning and announced the internal creation of a “ bas@@ k bank ” ( “ bas@@ k bank ” ) , containing 38 billion risky assets .
For its part , Vo@@ d@@ on@@ on@@ a ( + 2.@@ 45 % ) remains at the top of the Euro@@ F@@ ir@@ st@@ 300 increases in response to press news that AT &amp; T is investigating possible takeover bi@@ ds .
In the exchange market , speculation about the evolution of the ECB &apos;s monetary policy is going well , as John Har@@ dy has shown , a str@@ ing in S@@ ax@@ o Bank .
The ECB ’ s unique mandate has always focused on inflation , so Mari@@ o Dra@@ gh@@ i and his team have more reason to act at next week ’ s meeting .
We are anticip@@ ating a strong potential for the euro to fall .
In this context , the euro is continuing to re@@ treat against the US currency and has hit a lower two weeks at $ 1.@@ 3@@ 5@@ 17 .
On the contrary , these same con@@ jec@@ tures support the eurozone bond market .
Obama \ u@@ 00@@ 27@@ s Health Ch@@ all@@ enge Act
Great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court has now declared that Obama ’ s health-care health-care law has been constitutional .
By 5 votes to 4 , judges valid@@ ated the individual mandate of the P@@ ati@@ ent Protection and Af@@ for@@ dable C@@ are Act – which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014 , otherwise they have to pay a fine – and have declared that it is constitutional under government power .
Supreme Court President John Rob@@ er@@ ts has joined the four most liberal members of the Court , while the judges S@@ c@@ ili@@ a , Thomas , A@@ li@@ to and Ken@@ ne@@ dy have expressed their disagreement .
The Court has also valid@@ ated other sections of the law of 2 700 pages and has , moreover , considered that the provision of the health system reform law , which states that the eligibility threshold should be low@@ ered in Medic@@ aid , otherwise all federal funding of the programme should be lost , was coer@@ cive in accordance with the constitution .
The procedure to block the law has been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the first place in 2012 , including the nom@@ ine@@ e Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have fier@@ cely opposed the law .

In@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing Palestinians
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday 31 October 2013 in the evening in a brutal violent attack on the Gaza border and Israel , the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year .
The only power station in the Gaza Strip stopped operating on Friday 1 November following a deple@@ tion of its fuel stocks , announced the Energy Authority of the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve .
A local comm@@ ander of the E@@ zz@@ ed@@ din Al@@ assa@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ades , K@@ hal@@ ed Abu B@@ ak@@ r , and another framework of the Hamas armed branch , R@@ abi@@ h B@@ ari@@ ke@@ h , were killed by a sh@@ ar sh@@ ell@@ s in an Israeli army incur@@ sion to K@@ han Y@@ oun@@ es in southern Gaza , according to local medical sources .
Two other local officials in the Al@@ ma@@ m Bri@@ g@@ ades , Mo@@ ham@@ med al-@@ Q@@ ass@@ as and Mo@@ ham@@ med D@@ a@@ ud , were killed when an Israeli hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter opened fire in the same region .
Their bodies were discovered later on .
According to Palestinian security sources , the four combat@@ ants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve and Israel .
An attack on a tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses , an Israeli t@@ ank and a bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er have carried out an incur@@ sion of 100 metres within the territory before then withdrawing .
The confrontation has lasted half an hour , according to witnesses .
In a communi@@ qu@@ é , a Hamas spokesman , S@@ am@@ i Abu Z@@ ou@@ ha@@ ri , paid tribute to the four &apos; her@@ oes &apos; and said that Israeli soldiers had died during confrontation .
Hamas congratul@@ ates the her@@ oes of Al@@ assa@@ m who fell by defending the territory in an incur@@ sion by the Z@@ ion@@ ist occup@@ ier in K@@ han Y@@ oun@@ es .
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation .
&apos;@@ Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occup@@ ier &apos; , threatened the spokesman .
For its part , the Israeli army has indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel that has been stret@@ ched into Israeli territory since the Palestinian en@@ cla@@ ve , discovered on 7 October and which , according to the army , is intended to &apos; terrorist activities &apos; .
Hamas has claimed the use of tun@@ n@@ els to fight Israel , stating that the aim was to abduc@@ t Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners .
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel , explained an Israeli military release .
During the operation , Hamas unle@@ ashed an explosive ent@@ ang@@ le@@ hold aimed at the T@@ Sa@@ ah@@ al forces ( the Israeli army ) and injured 5 soldiers .
Israeli At@@ t@@ acks in northern Syria
&apos;@@ This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians &apos; , and also indicated the spokesman of the army Peter L@@ er@@ ner .
Moreover , Israel has struck an air military base in nor@@ th@@ west Syria , aimed at a ship@@ ment of missiles for the Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement Hezbollah , reported on Thursday 31 October the Al@@ -@@ Ara@@ bi@@ ya satellite channel .
An American official confirmed an &apos; Israeli strike &apos; but did not give details of the target .
&apos;@@ In the past , the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah &apos; , just adding to it .
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack .
With the “ exclusive sources ” that it has not named , the Saudi capital chain has indicated that &apos; the bombing has targeted a ship@@ ment of air missiles for Hezbollah in Lebanon &apos; , referring to the powerful Lebanese Shi@@ ite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces .
Ear@@ lier , an Syrian NGO , the Syrian Human Rights Observ@@ atory , reported several explo@@ sions that were heard on Wednesday at the d@@ aw@@ n in an air defence base at S@@ on@@ ar J@@ ab@@ é , near L@@ att@@ ri@@ é , on the Syrian coast .
This organisation based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of explo@@ sions .
De@@ ar in black and white for Mari@@ e Ch@@ oul@@ in@@ ard , who is presenting Dan@@ se Dan@@ es his two new group ch@@ or@@ us : the first inspired by Hen@@ ri Mic@@ hael &apos;s gre@@ ed and po@@ ems , the second im@@ pul@@ sed by the famous so@@ ano G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ oper@@ es of Sa@@ ot .
One evening to see the whole pr@@ ism of Ch@@ oul@@ in@@ ard , art at the ti@@ p and black black .
A white scre@@ en is used as a fundamental wall .
On the car@@ pet , so white , in the vast space of the The@@ ar M@@ ond , moving forward , profile , end like a black line and clo@@ thes , a body .
On the scre@@ en , a ink of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ hael is planned .
The body , which is simple , takes its form .
And this form will be the whole story : a bo@@ y of physical im@@ itations .
The d@@ s@@ s@@ ers , who are fully clo@@ thes of black , only their hands and dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble face , are waiting on each side of the game , rush@@ ing when the next population appears , embo@@ dies it .
The black and white game of Hen@@ ri Mic@@ hael is being carried out with so@@ ber@@ s , in un@@ ison of un@@ ison ( a mass that is doing a dis@@ service ) , in a large group of twelve so@@ lo@@ s .
We think of the &apos; G@@ l@@ ory of morning &apos; , where Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard was carrying out a series of written ch@@ or@@ us duties on car@@ t@@ els , put online at the forefront .
This is the same principle , the giant P@@ ow@@ er@@ Po@@ int version .
Here , music is strong , per@@ va@@ sive and electric .
Energy is high , the pace is always fast .
There will be a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold when Car@@ ol Pri@@ er will take refuge under the d@@ ance car@@ pet , to hand over , micro@@ phone in hand , without so@@ ber or restraint , a part of Mic@@ hael , mon@@ ot@@ or@@ de , and mon@@ ot@@ one in scre@@ en , and will continue with d@@ ance .
And music to leave , and the sequ@@ ence to resume .
This sound and energe@@ tic discharge , long , if that is possible , eventually ends up falling apart .
As is also the regul@@ arity of the visual rate .
There are a few fine s@@ na@@ ils - the creation of images has always been a force in Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard - such as those ha@@ ir ha@@ ir , which is getting bo@@ gged down or those black tissu@@ es that extend the lines .
But the ch@@ or@@ us approach lacks composition .
We have the impression that the ch@@ or@@ us , instead of going to Mic@@ hael &apos;s work , has imposed itself , with its s@@ ons .
As a result , the bodies appear to be at the front .
Mic@@ hael &apos;s cr@@ ass , like G@@ es@@ tal@@ t forms , opens up a wider and more gi@@ g@@ an@@ tic imag@@ inary than d@@ ance , more pi@@ ous .
Only the end , in negative terms , with his d@@ an@@ ters m@@ inc@@ ed with g@@ los@@ so@@ op@@ ic light and white signs in a sudden black theat@@ re , touches the magic .
The public loved , the reception was warm .
The G@@ y@@ m@@ n@@ ies , after the inter@@ play , are richer .
The scene is partly empty , the d@@ an@@ ters and a pi@@ ano are covered by tissu@@ es , such as fur@@ nit@@ ure in a neglected house .
To the pi@@ ano , d@@ s@@ s@@ ers were re@@ leg@@ ated to play the game .
Their mis@@ matches in music , tou@@ ching , give real frag@@ ility .
On the scene , we spend couples , very sen@@ sibly , very sen@@ sibly , even erosion .
As a group of groups , small so@@ lo@@ s of transi@@ tions , which move , shocking , writing is less bin@@ ary .
There are but@@ chers , as well as Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , s@@ inging the red no@@ se , in highly pol@@ ari@@ zed male women .
The am@@ ail@@ s are car@@ n@@ at@@ ers , fleeing or players .
S@@ ucc@@ ess@@ ness , li@@ ps and sh@@ ou@@ ting trans@@ mit the ar@@ cha@@ ic , gr@@ ace and ridiculous bodies in co@@ t .
But the coin takes its real flight after sal@@ vation .
There is a c@@ at on the scene when the public leaves out .
There is everything to be allowed : the fourth wall falls , the un@@ explo@@ ded uni@@ verse is super@@ se@@ ded , the bo@@ vine d@@ s@@ s@@ ors , the spec@@ t@@ ators , g@@ los@@ s@@ or , smoke , sle@@ ep@@ wal@@ ks , and so on .
It is joy and mad@@ ness , and it is the art of Ch@@ ou@@ in@@ ard , to contamin@@ ate the public .
Google , Sam@@ sun@@ g and Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i are the subject of criminal prosecution
The group which has thousands of former patents in Nor@@ tel has begun an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of legal proceedings on patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that it hi@@ j@@ acked at the he@@ ight of the patent auc@@ tion which took place after the collapse of the Nor@@ tel .
Ro@@ k@@ star , the cons@@ or@@ ti@@ um that acquired the Nor@@ tel patents for $ 4@@ .5 M@@ d , lod@@ ged a complaint against Sam@@ sun@@ g Elec@@ tr@@ onic C@@ o L@@ t@@ d , H@@ T@@ C Cor@@ p , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and four other companies for patent infringement before the US Court of Auditors in T@@ ex@@ as .
Ro@@ k@@ star is held jointly by Ap@@ ple , Micro@@ soft , Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , E@@ ric@@ sson and S@@ ony .
Google is accused of having violated seven patents .
Pat@@ ents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in connection with research on the Internet , and have indicated the outcome of the trial , which is the core of Google .
It was not possible to join the representatives of Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , H@@ T@@ C and Ro@@ k@@ star .
Sam@@ sun@@ g , Hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and H@@ T@@ C manufacture tele@@ phones operating under the An@@ dro@@ d operating system of Google , which provides fierce competition to both mobile and Micro@@ soft mobile products .
In 2011 , Google made an initial offer of $ 900 for the patents of Nor@@ tel .
Google has increased its offer several times , finally proposing $ 4.@@ 4 trillion .
Having lost the Nor@@ tel patents in the face of Ro@@ k@@ star , Google later acquired Mo@@ tor@@ ola Mob@@ i@@ ary for $ 12.@@ 5 trillion , a market partly based on Mo@@ tor@@ ola ’ s patent libr@@ ary .
“ Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auc@@ tion , Google violated and continues to violate so-called patents , ” indicated the outcome of the trial .
Ro@@ k@@ star calls for greater damages against Google , because he claims that the violation of Google &apos;s patents is stub@@ born , according to the complain@@ ant .
Ex@@ p@@ lo@@ sion from a house to G@@ es@@ ves : a defec@@ tive water that caused the explosion of the explosion
The grand@@ mother would have fired a cigarette during a gas le@@ ak .
The explosion of a house in G@@ es@@ ves , which caused two serious injuries Friday morning , a grand@@ mother of 52 years and his 5 year-old grand@@ son , is due to a gas le@@ ak@@ age from a defec@@ tive he@@ at@@ er , indicated on Friday evening the replacement of the Ro@@ i prosecutor .
The public prosecutor &apos;s expert ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely acci@@ dental .
The grand@@ mother turned a cigarette when there was a le@@ ak@@ age and accumulation of gas .
The vital prog@@ no@@ sis of the two victims is still committed .
The grand@@ mother was projected by the explosion and is so@@ aring .
The small bo@@ y , who sat at his grand@@ father and his compan@@ ions , was on his side and was bur@@ ned slightly .
&apos;@@ The two victims were in@@ tu@@ b@@ bed and long condi@@ tioned on the spot before being taken to the C@@ ory de Li@@ è@@ ge , she was am@@ bul@@ ance , am@@ bul@@ ance &apos; , he said the qu@@ ag@@ mire José Paul@@ et , who took the place .
The grand@@ father was on the floor at the time of the explosion .
S@@ een and except , he was able to join the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m by the st@@ ab@@ ilit@@ y-@@ -@@ while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed .
The grand@@ father and the ten@@ ant of the neighb@@ or house , weakened by the explosion , have been rela@@ yed by the Chairman of the CA@@ P@@ AS .
The fire@@ men of An@@ dean and N@@ am@@ ur and the Ar@@ med police intervened .

Egypt is asking for the first freely elected president to pay li@@ p service to s@@ wor@@ n r@@ ath .
Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si l@@ ent his inaug@@ ur@@ ation , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt .
The Islamist Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si promised the emergence of a “ new Egypt ” when he l@@ ent the presidency to the presidency , thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to H@@ os@@ ni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier .
In his inaug@@ ur@@ ation before the High Constitutional Court , Mr Mor@@ si has also become the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth Head of State since the mon@@ archy was over@@ thrown 60 years ago .
He paid li@@ p service to the 18 judges in the Court ’ s black bo@@ y , whose building on the N@@ ile was built to look like an Egyptian temp@@ le .
“ We aspire to a better day , a new Egypt and a second re@@ public , ” President Mor@@ si said during the formal ceremony broadcast directly on public television .
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” explained Mr Mor@@ si , a 60 year-old engine@@ er in the United States , from the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group viewed for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal organisation and hard-@@ pressed by successive governments .
H@@ und@@ reds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr Mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11 hours , a local hour , followed by a small con@@ voy .
Only a few hundred f@@ ans had gathered before the Court to che@@ at the new president and , depar@@ ting from the presidential presidency of the Mubarak years , the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage from his con@@ voy to the very crow@@ ded streets linking the cen@@ tre@@ -@@ city to the southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
As the Muslim Brotherhood ’ s un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ relief wheel , ” its personal prestige has strengthened considerably since its victory and Friday ’ s speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to end the work begun during the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak ’ s authoritarian president .
&apos;@@ Egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional and modern state &apos; , and has declared Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , in blue co@@ stu@@ m and a red cr@@ at , addressing the judges in the or@@ bit of rub@@ b@@ ish in which he s@@ its .
Lat@@ er , Mr Mor@@ si went to the University of Cairo where he made his inaug@@ ural speech .
He was officially gre@@ eted by a military fan@@ fare who played the national an@@ them when he went to the gar@@ den .
The Mar@@ sh@@ al Hussein T@@ an@@ ta@@ i attended the ceremony .
When he arrived , he was gre@@ eted by the &apos; people and the army , hand in hand ... &apos; en@@ du@@ red by thousands of people gathered in the great University of the university .
Based in 19@@ 08 and the former bas@@ tion of secular education , Cairo ’ s University later became a ti@@ ef of Islamist students ’ groups in the 1970 ’ s .
Mr Mor@@ si made a symbolic symbol@@ ism on Friday in Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square , from which the uprising that ended Mubarak ’ s authoritarian regime last year , and ordered to recover the presidential powers of which the military council , which replaced the former president who had been thrown out , was dispos@@ s@@ essed .
But by agreeing to formally lend to the Court , rather than to Parliament as it is customary , it stands in the way of the army ’ s will by showing that the struggle for power is not over .
Mr Mor@@ si &apos;s speech on Ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r Square has been accompanied by spectacular populist gest@@ ures .
The United States ’ sh@@ ut@@ down slow@@ ed down the car market increase
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weigh@@ ed on the growth in car sales in the US in October , showing the figures published on Friday by the manufacturers , five of the six main performing performance .
The three major De@@ tro@@ it manufacturers have double-@@ dig@@ it growth compared to October 2012 , but only General Mo@@ tors has done better than expected .
An@@ aly@@ sts anticipated an average of 15@@ .@@ 4 million sales in ann@@ u@@ alized r@@ hy@@ th@@ m and corrected seasonal variations , but the market was set at 15@@ .@@ 3 million according to the estimates of the Morgan Stan@@ ley analy@@ sts , Adam Stan@@ ley .
In a note to the bank &apos;s clients , he believes that this slight bra@@ ke is primarily due to the &apos; government sh@@ ut@@ down and its impact on the feeling of the consumer in the first half of the month &apos; .
G@@ M , however , has reported that nearly 16 % of its sales last month increase to 2@@ 26 40@@ 02 vehicles , compared to 2@@ 11 5@@ 63 , expected by the consensus .
The four bran@@ ds of the group have seen their trade performance improved compared to October 2012 .
Ford , which continues to benefit from the success of its peak peak , has seen its sales move from 14 % over a year to 19@@ 1 9@@ 85 vehicles , while the consensus expected 19@@ 4 30@@ 1 .
For its part , Ch@@ ry@@ s@@ ler , controlled by Fi@@ at , has announced a 11 % increase in its sales to 140 0@@ 83 vehicles , compared to 14@@ 3 5@@ 36 .

Two people were killed , and another was seriously injured on Friday night by sho@@ oting two people on board a mo@@ on who was going through a local , neo-@@ Nazi A@@ be party in the western sub@@ ur@@ bs of Athens , and was learned from police sources .
The police were unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political aff@@ ili@@ ation .
Some Greek media reported that members of Gol@@ den D@@ aw@@ n had argued that the victims were local guards .

You thought that travel agencies were in the past because of the Internet ?
F@@ loo@@ ds seem to reverse the trend .
Society has revised its net profits forecasts and hopes for record results through the ho@@ lid@@ ay@@ ers of Australia and the UK .
The travel agency now expects to achieve an underlying benefit over the entire exercise between 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 dollars before taxes , against a previous forecast of 30@@ 5 to $ 3@@ 15 .
If current forecasts are achieved , it will represent 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record benefit of $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 in 2011 / 12 .
The Director-General , Gra@@ ham Tur@@ ner , said that F@@ li@@ ham Centre had achieved 8 % of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force , particularly as regards travel other than business travel in Australia and the UK .
&apos;@@ Since the beginning of the year , the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable , and several of them are on the right track to achieve record results over the whole exercise before deduc@@ ting interest and taxes &apos; .
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom , which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits .
In Australia , the rec@@ rea@@ tional travel sector has returned in the second half of the year , which has made it possible to compensate for a small domestic market in business travel .
Similarly , in the United Kingdom , the F@@ li@@ h@@ at leisure sector has produced good results , while business customers have spent less .
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year in which seasonal demand is lower and had to benefit from the whole exercise for the third con@@ secu@@ tive time .
The F@@ light Centre ’ s actions increased by 3 c@@ ents to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .

Un@@ familiar unknown unknown conditions opened the fire this Friday on a ho@@ tel close to the Cairo py@@ ra@@ mid in Egypt without making victims , as a result of an apparent dispute with redundant workers .
The att@@ ack@@ ers took the flight , specified the spokesman of the Interior Ministry , the police General Ab@@ del L@@ ative .
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has hardly received any tourists since the army de@@ posed the Islamist President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si early July and has been putting his supporters in the blood@@ shed in blood .

In English literature courses , pupils will have to study at least one piece of Sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a nine@@ teen@@ th-@@ century novel , a ro@@ man@@ tic po@@ em , and a modern British fic@@ tion of 19@@ 14 today .
The examination will also present &apos; new texts &apos; to encourage a more diverse reading .
A course that comb@@ ines literature and English language will be removed .
From 2015 onwards , pupils will have to pass an independent language G@@ C@@ SE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature .
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and M@@ ath@@ s programmes tomorrow – the first materials to undergo radical revision .
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year .
On the other hand , O@@ f@@ tal , the regulatory Office of the exam@@ inations , will reveal a review of the structure of the G@@ C@@ SE , with a new rating system and less .
Speaking during the summer , Mic@@ hael Goe@@ ve , the Education Minister , said that there was a &apos; broad consensus on the need to reform our system of exam@@ inations to restore public confidence &apos; , stressing that the G@@ C@@ SE would be &apos; more stimulating , more ambitious and more rigorous &apos; .
Stu@@ dies show that English schools spend less time on m@@ ath@@ s ( 1@@ 16 hours a year , 3 hours a week during the school year ) than most other countries .
By contrast , Austr@@ ali@@ an schools offer an average of 14@@ 3 hours per year , and the Singapore pupils make about 13@@ 8 hours .
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours of time on m@@ ath@@ s , sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the G@@ C@@ SE of deep m@@ ath@@ s – as well as the greater emphasis on materials in international ran@@ kings – would probably encourage schools to provide more hours .
The programme will focus more on the “ real world problems , ” including financial mathema@@ tics .
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in that state and seriously questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force .

&quot; His body was buried in 1945 in a common f@@ es@@ ti@@ val of the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Mit@@ te &quot; , he in@@ sured on a daily basis by relying on archi@@ ve documents .
This re@@ vel@@ ation , 68 years after the end of Ad@@ ol@@ f Hitler ’ s Nazi regime , would respond to one of the Great War ’ s great insi@@ ghts .
The German secret services , the B@@ N@@ D , ensured that during the summer of 19@@ 49 , Mü@@ ller was in Kar@@ lo@@ v@@ y V@@ ary , then in Cz@@ echo@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ akia , according to a document obtained by Bil@@ d .
The secret services were completely wrong .
&apos;@@ In August 1945 , the body of Mü@@ ller was found in a provisional grave near the former Ministry of Re@@ ich in Re@@ ich &apos; , according to Mr T@@ uc@@ hel .
He was &apos; a uniform of general &apos; .
&apos;@@ In the left domestic poc@@ ket was his service states with a pho@@ to &apos; .
Bil@@ d also publ@@ ishes a document from the r@@ ing-@@ fen@@ cing town in the Mit@@ te district in Berlin that was buried in the Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery in the district .
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany , Di@@ ter Gr@@ au@@ au@@ mann , was shocked by this re@@ vel@@ ation .
If one of the most brutal Nazi sad@@ es is buried in a Jewish c@@ eme@@ tery , it is a huge taste of bad taste .
&apos;@@ The memory of the victims is g@@ ros@@ sly ri@@ fe &apos; .
He@@ in@@ rich Mü@@ ller is one of the important figures in the Third Re@@ ich who have never been cap@@ tured .
It took part in the W@@ ann@@ e@@ e Conference in January 19@@ 42 , which decided on the &apos; final solution &apos; and , in particular , under its orders Ad@@ ol@@ f E@@ ich@@ mann , responsible for the &apos; logistics &apos; of the ex@@ termination of Jews , sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 196@@ 2 .

Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le exemp@@ li@@ fies free health care in Cam@@ ero@@ on villages
Dr B@@ ow@@ le and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients .
There are not many doctors in this West African country , just 1 for 5 000 inhabitants .
Vo@@ te here or through your mobile apparatus
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le is one of the 10 Her@@ os C@@ C@@ N of 2013 .
You can vote for him , or one of the other 10 her@@ oes , to elect him &apos; H@@ é@@ os C@@ N@@ N of the year &apos; .
This person will receive $ 25@@ ,000 to continue his extraordinary work .
For 21 years , Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le watched his father ill alter@@ n@@ ating periods of conscience and conscience and travelling to hospitals that were not equipped to help him .
James B@@ ow@@ le was injured in a car accident in 198@@ 1 near Y@@ a@@ ou@@ d@@ é , the capital of Cam@@ ero@@ on .
Ini@@ tially , he had only a broken arm , but he contr@@ acted a infection that spread to his brain , creating a ha@@ em@@ at@@ om@@ ite whose aftermath was the rest of his life .
“ There was no neuro@@ sur@@ gical in Cam@@ ero@@ on , ” Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le said .
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money .
Instead , Dr B@@ ow@@ le spent years supporting his father in crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospitals , so that he got any treatment he could receive .
&apos;@@ It is not easy &apos; , adding Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
You can leave the house at 5 p.m. , go to hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
There are many patients .
People can die because they are waiting for too long .
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr B@@ ow@@ le &apos;s father in 2002 .
In Cam@@ ero@@ on , there is only one doctor for 5 000 inhabitants , according to the World Health Organisation .
By way of comparison , the US ratio is 1 doctor for 4@@ 13 inhabitants .
And even if they could see a doctor , many Cam@@ ero@@ on could not pay for consultation .
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three-@@ quarters of the country &apos;s health spending is carried out in the private sector .
&apos;@@ The only problem they have is poverty &apos; , explained Dr B@@ ow@@ le .
And because of poverty , they cannot benefit from life .
Having seen his father and his comp@@ at@@ riots suffering , Dr B@@ ow@@ le was determined to try to change the course .
Dr Ge@@ org@@ es B@@ ow@@ le and his voluntary team have carried out more than 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the last year .
He became a doctor himself , working like sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in Y@@ a@@ ou@@ d@@ é .
It created a non-@@ profit@@ -making humanitarian association , SA@@ CO@@ V@@ E , which goes to rural areas during week@@ ends to provide free healthcare .
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32 000 people .
Ne@@ arly every Friday , with 30 people , goes into fo@@ d@@ der after setting medical equipment on the ro@@ of and crossing difficult land to travel to the villages most in need .
The luck does not always follow them .
They have repeatedly had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or bo@@ xes .
But when they arrive , they are received as her@@ oes : the community organis@@ es a celebration , cher@@ ish , d@@ ance and offers them the best available housing .
In these villages , free health care is a good reason to celebrate , and Dr B@@ ow@@ le – with his great s@@ mile and hard energy – is more than happy to join the cele@@ bra@@ tions .
The next morning , the team is beginning to receive hundreds of patients .
&apos;@@ We receive 500 people from every visit &apos; , said Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
They sometimes live at 60 km of the village , and they come up .
In this travelling hospital , various health care is being provided .
Many people receive treatment against malaria , tuberculosis , mal@@ nutrition , diabetes , par@@ as@@ ites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
Others can receive bro@@ k@@ els , a p@@ lot of ch@@ ick@@ ens collected or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school , but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it .
In the evening , the team practi@@ ses simple sur@@ gical acts under local an@@ a@@ es@@ thetic .
Oper@@ ations are usually carried out in a school , a home or a house ; after the intervention , the patient stands up and goes to the aw@@ ak@@ ening room to leave his place to the next person .
Thanks to the lighting of the elec@@ tro@@ gene group , the operating room and the ster@@ ili@@ zation of equipment , Dr B@@ ow@@ le and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning .
This is a slow pace , but village mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans usually help the team to remain motivated .
&apos;@@ They are kno@@ cking on bul@@ lets every night to keep us awa@@ ke so that we can continue to work &apos; , explained Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
Sunday , the team is returning to town , tired but proud of the work it has done .
The group , consisting of Cam@@ ero@@ on doctors and medical students , carried out 700 sur@@ gical acts free of charge over the last year , and knows that their presence can make all the difference to those to whom they help .
A man explained that the free operation he had had to treat a her@@ d would allow him to work again .
“ This will change my future and that of my family , ” said man .
In addition to making this travelling hospital live and working like sur@@ ge@@ on in hospital , Dr B@@ ow@@ le also works at night in private medical firms around Y@@ a@@ ou@@ d@@ é .
It is the second job , he says , which finances the association of 60 % ; the rest is covered by private donations .
“ I don ’ t know when he sle@@ pt , ” said K@@ ati@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , a medical student in the second year of the D@@ re@@ x@@ el University in Ph@@ il@@ ade@@ l@@ p@@ hi@@ a and volunte@@ er in Dr B@@ w@@ el@@ le .
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns .
For medical students and nurses such as K@@ ec@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr B@@ ow@@ le in his missions , this is an opportunity for learning on the ground .
&apos;@@ We have been able to take part in operations to help blood blood or get the instruments to Dr B@@ ow@@ le &apos; .
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are medical student in the second year .
Volun@@ tary students generally pay their journey to Cam@@ ero@@ on , and often arrive with medical equipment collected .
But once in Y@@ a@@ ou@@ d@@ é , their pensions , transport and education are taken care of by Dr B@@ ow@@ le .
&apos;@@ It is a her@@ o , there is no doubt &apos; , said K@@ ati@@ t O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley .
He gives his life for this association , and his desire to help the people of Cam@@ ero@@ on is not nearly the same .
For Dr B@@ ow@@ le , the relatively constant work@@ load is not a problem .
Hel@@ ping others to live happy with the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy .
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” added Mr B@@ ow@@ le .
And I am thinking of my father .
I hope he sees what I am doing .
Making people lau@@ gh and allevi@@ ating pain is the reason for me to do that .
Look at the SA@@ CO@@ V@@ E site to see how to help .
The France of Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a
The aca@@ demics have long strugg@@ led to define and place Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a .
Professor in the amp@@ hi@@ theat@@ res and the st@@ alls ?
Perhaps , but by under@@ lining its weakness for the roads , S@@ c@@ en@@ c@@ es-@@ P@@ o , the High East E@@ u@@ ds .
Ab@@ out the works of others in his office on the G@@ as@@ t@@ ton G@@ alli@@ mar@@ d ?
Indeed , while ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publ@@ ish@@ er .
H@@ ec@@ tier of the f@@ us@@ s that Fon@@ ten@@ le occupied the French A@@ ca@@ de@@ my ?
Of course , but in the knowledge that such a sac@@ re cannot replace real ho@@ ly oil , that of the thesis , which has happened .
They have will@@ ingly acknowledged in him a great , anim@@ ator , and a feder@@ ator of their work , but by pointing out that he was reluctant to produce himself .
To this uncertain image the monu@@ ment of the “ L@@ aw@@ s of rememb@@ r@@ ance , ” to which he attached his name , has also contributed .
The bad languages have been able to see a huge market in the chi@@ ps , presented by an intelligent com@@ ment@@ ator , with a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se and b@@ ann@@ er of beg@@ ging , but incur@@ ring .
The two works published by Nor@@ a almost two years ago have already established that the person who was going to do not write had a lot and written written .
The book that should be made to it definitively justice .
Once again , however , it is once again the temptation of u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity , the intellectual v@@ ag@@ mire , the ju@@ bil@@ ation that is being b@@ reached together with one another .
But it is quickly understood that the dispar@@ ate objects gathered in the book in such beautiful terms bring the br@@ ush to one passion : to discover the core constituent of French identity .
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity ?
I@@ d@@ entity : that is a matter of time .
We have been collectively invited to provide a definition .
But in the per@@ re@@ pti@@ tious spirit of our leaders then , the French identity was an in@@ sup@@ pressing petrol .
It was necessary only to deploy accidents , and the case , J@@ ac@@ ob@@ in@@ ism , was forced into the pre@@ fec@@ ts and sub@@ pre@@ ts , authorised interpreters .
What Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a is doing is quite different .
It does not arise as a he@@ ir of e@@ ternal fran@@ cs , it refuses to define the definition .
An@@ al@@ y@@ ist worried about a familiar str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold , he for@@ fe@@ ited in a forest of symbols , arrested at every step by an object in the form of re@@ tri@@ eve .
Are they coming from the company itself : why , in a country that is so long-@@ lasting on its borders , so formerly char@@ tered and firmly ti@@ mid , are these dramatic calls for unity ?
They are so pressing , suggest Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a , that the disorder caused by the dis@@ cor@@ d in French history is to be avoided .
Fran@@ ques and G@@ aw@@ s , Ar@@ mag@@ n@@ ac@@ s and Bour@@ gu@@ ons , Ca@@ thol@@ ics and Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts : the division forces here are very old .
The most emb@@ le@@ matic is , of course , the one that ren@@ ders national history .
From the revolution of the revolution , the French have two stories and they have two nations , a mon@@ arch@@ ic , the other revolutionary .
The second wanted the death of the first , but it did not succeed in denying it ; instead , it was concerned to regain the sac@@ ra@@ bility and all the more vi@@ br@@ ant of unity and indi@@ visibility that it had cut its heads to the obvious and powerful embo@@ di@@ ment .
And , from that point of view , an inv@@ inci@@ bly bin@@ ary nation shared between left and right , sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ ism , and Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism , ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ation and hatred of revolution .
In order to make the French identity unique , there is no point in the four steps outside the H@@ exagger@@ one , so that Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a may be the heart of his book .
Because both America and France have made a revolution , written a declaration of rights , wanted to build a new society .
But the US k@@ it@@ ch@@ en is better placed to underline what is our own .
There , men who had left their An@@ we@@ gi@@ an Region in England and no longer had to worry about it .
Here , the crow@@ ded men of an ancient indigenous region , and all the more radical men .
This is a consensu@@ al revolution when it s@@ its the drama and the entr@@ ance .
Here the founding fathers who are still honoured , and here the revolutionary anc@@ estors , who are hardly able to make models , and who have , moreover , been killed .
Here , institutional consistency , and here a cas@@ c@@ ade of constitutions , as errors to be made and tests to be resumed .
France , which is going to France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes to the end of France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes from France , which comes to France
There was , however , a time when the French thought they were able to roll back their history ro@@ gue and defeat the cur@@ se of the two .
In the I@@ I@@ th , a central and creative moment , Pi@@ er@@ re Nor@@ a has shown great interest and ten@@ acity : welcoming those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide , teach school@@ children anything that in the former France was stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history .
But this peaceful identity has had only one time .
This is once again in the debate , driven by immigration of a new type , which is threatened by the rise of re@@ union minorities , absor@@ bed in the European area .
So the book offers both the fascin@@ ating portra@@ it of France that is going on and the cautious ske@@ t@@ ch of France that comes from .
At the premium of the histor@@ ian of the histor@@ ian , which should set aside some sur@@ prises .
It is discovered that the railway was a ca@@ ke .
The man of multiple cu@@ o@@ si@@ ties looked , slightly obs@@ es@@ sively , around the same idea .
The man@@ ure played at the centre of the centre .
And the one who , more than half a century ago , tabled a subject on the idea of a nation , but had taken away from the initial exercise of the thesis , entr@@ u@@ sts us with the s@@ ali@@ ent s@@ m of the p@@ am , which he will eventually have done .
True , in a less ra@@ id , fragmented and sub@@ tle form .
But let us not dec@@ eive ourselves , just as binding .
For much more than the figure imposed on the university curricul@@ um , this record says the internal necessity of a life .
A former hostages in Lebanon : &apos; The return is quite complex to manage &apos; .
In Be@@ ir@@ ut , on 8 March 1986 , with three members of his &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; team , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released , the journalist Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din was released almost 21 months later on 27 November 1987 .
Re@@ jec@@ ted since 2008 , he took part in the creation of the &apos; World O@@ ut@@ look of the World &apos; , which he has presid@@ ed over for several years .
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
More than 1 000 days , the four hostages of A@@ q@@ i ( Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) Dan@@ i@@ el L@@ ar@@ be , Th@@ i@@ er@@ ry D@@ ol , Pi@@ er@@ re Le@@ grand and Mar@@ c F@@ é@@ et were released on Tuesday .
After medical exam@@ inations at the V@@ al-@@ D@@ ai@@ de military hospital on Wednesday afternoon , they have been able to return to their families .
And , gradually , try to return to their lives .
&apos;@@ The New Ob@@ ser@@ ver &apos; has questioned Jean-@@ Lou@@ is Nor@@ man@@ din , 62 years old , which has been postponed since 2008 , which has been re@@ treated since 2008 , the president of the World Food Organisation .
From the evening of your release , you were on the 20@@ th of &apos; An@@ ten@@ ne 2 &apos; .
What are your memories of your release today ?
In particular , in Be@@ ir@@ ut .
When I am released , I find myself in the co@@ ff@@ er of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Ro@@ ger Au@@ que .
He tells me &apos; we are released &apos; , but I am not sure , and tell me that we can still be killed .
We are very exc@@ ited but very tense too .
It is war , and those who drive us are also very tense .
They are putting us on the edge of a tro@@ t@@ ch .
There are Syrian soldiers .
Then we arrive on the Su@@ m@@ mer@@ land ho@@ tel site where the press is present .
The French bring us to the French emb@@ ass@@ y .
This is the time for the first b@@ lows to parents , the family , friends and the press ...
I remember having taken a b@@ ath for an hour .
And having d@@ row@@ ned in F@@ -@@ shir@@ t at the French emb@@ ass@@ y .
I also remember a short night to discuss with Ro@@ ger and Mar@@ chi@@ ani .
The tension is still there , because we do not have the means to evac@@ u@@ ate ourselves to L@@ ar@@ n@@ ac@@ a airport in Cyprus .
Ar@@ med there in hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , we are taking a private plane that brings us back to France via Cor@@ f@@ u and Sol@@ ren@@ z@@ ara , where P@@ as@@ qua is in charge .
How did you arrive on French soil ?
O@@ ut of Or@@ ly .
Chirac , Prime Minister , is there .
It is a bit brutal .
There is an incredible bot@@ tle .
And there is a lot of media in the media .
When I left there three television channels .
I have just returned .
The des@@ cent from the aircraft cr@@ ack@@ down , the re@@ vel@@ ations with my son and my parents , my friends , all of this is extremely strong in emotion .
Between the airport and my home , many motor@@ cycles follow our car as R@@ ab@@ on leads .
The motor@@ ists are getting the qu@@ ery to make photo@@ s and follow me up to where I have to do the police a little to prevent some of them from going up .
There is a huge amount of media pressure .
It does not stop , we are well placed to know ...
But the state of emotion and fa@@ ti@@ gue is such that it is difficult to see it .
We are leaving a hole and we are suddenly in the media spot@@ light .
It is a little complicated , a little violent , quite complex to manage .
But we have done the hardest .
I myself am at 20@@ th , and the next day , too , I am on the television .
Then it is a kind of re@@ alignment to life , very slowly , for one or two months , which are a little like holiday .
How has the medical exam@@ inations and the D@@ G@@ SE de@@ bri@@ g gone ?
I had a first medical check in Cor@@ si@@ ca .
The rest has been done in the V@@ al-@@ day V@@ al-@@ day I return : radio , all kinds of exam@@ inations and a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t .
It is not a sitting that does everything , but we know that we can count on him , to remind him if need be , that we are not handed over to ourselves .
That is part of the procedure .
I also met the intelligence services .
They asked me questions about the hostages .
It was logical to do this .
That did not bo@@ de me .
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Ni@@ ger ?
I listen to what is said .
The debate on ran@@ so@@ m in particular .
Some things anno@@ y me , others less .
I am trying to make the point between the questions on my past as a hostage and my h@@ at of President of the &apos; World Food Organisation &apos; , which allows me to distance myself , and I think it is much more interesting .
I wonder , for example , about the definition of resili@@ ence .
Above all , I am fighting , together with others , for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage .
I think there is a problem of sem@@ an@@ tics .
We must call hostages to take hostages &apos; political &apos; - which is the case most time - and allow hostages to have access to justice , to complain and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court .
Today , once again , everyone is in comp@@ as@@ sion , emotion , and welcomes the release of these hostages .
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice ?
A tribunal in The Hague is done for that .
Why are we not saying to the hostage ho@@ kers &apos; you have fl@@ ou@@ ted the rules of war , like those of all the Geneva Conventions , you are going to bring you to justice &apos; ?
This seems to me to be justified , legitimate , struck in common sense .
This message is heard , but not listened to .
That is my main fight .
The Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Mor@@ si ’ s trial
The anger f@@ lies in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists .
Two days before the trial of the de@@ posed President Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si , they took on the streets .
A mobili@@ zation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country ’ s first democratically elected president .
This is not a case in point .
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the documents .
This is not a trial , it is a far@@ ce .
President Mor@@ si &apos;s trial is a false trial against a pro-@@ Mor@@ si , it is he who is supposed to make S@@ is@@ i trial , not the other way round .
Mor@@ si must judge S@@ is@@ i for the massacres in R@@ ab@@ ata , the massacres in N@@ ah@@ da , and the massacre of the Republican Gu@@ ard .
S@@ is@@ i is a li@@ ar and a tra@@ itor .
There have been clashes in Alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the police used te@@ ar gas , 60 demonstrators were arrested .
On Monday , 20 000 police officers will be deployed before the police ac@@ ade@@ my in Cairo , where Mo@@ hamed Mor@@ si will be judged .
H@@ ag@@ el blam@@ es nine American states to violate homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognised homosexual marriage , &apos; all military spouses have the right to an identity card of the Defense Department and to the benefits that come with &apos; , recalled the Minister in New York in a speech to the An@@ tin@@ an@@ ization League to fight anti-Semitism .
&apos;@@ But some states refuse to issue these maps to sa@@ me-@@ sex sa@@ me-@@ sa@@ me-@@ sa@@ me-@@ sa@@ me-@@ sa@@ iling facilities &apos; , he denounced , accused these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality .
Without these cards , these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases , or access to their shops .
The Secretary of Defense has said that he has ordered the head of the National Gu@@ ard , General Fr@@ ank G@@ ass , to ensure that federal law is implemented .
The fronts of the nine states began with T@@ ex@@ as , which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the T@@ ex@@ ana National Gu@@ ard , owing to a conflict between the law and the federal law on homosexual marriage .
He was joined in his refusal by Indi@@ ana , Georgia , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , M@@ iss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , Lou@@ is@@ i@@ ana , O@@ k@@ la@@ hom@@ a , South Car@@ ol@@ ine , and Western Vir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , according to a senior defense officer .
The Pen@@ tag@@ on estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to around 5@@ 600 active people , 17 000 including the National Gu@@ ard , the reserve and the pensioners .
Sixth edi@@ tion of the P@@ ary Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard
The sixth edi@@ tion of the P@@ ary Sk@@ ate@@ bo@@ ard is taking place on Saturday 2 November at the C@@ ut@@ k in H@@ y@@ ers .
With the S@@ K@@ 8 Un@@ it of the Bu@@ m@@ p Association , the competition should bring together the best sk@@ ir@@ ts in the region .
In@@ clu@@ sions are taken on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start at 10 a.m. before the end of 3 p.m. and the award of prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to ad@@ mire the technical pro@@ w@@ ess of young people who , for some , already experience competi@@ tions at the highest level , like the young hy@@ bri@@ d prof@@ li@@ g@@ ate L@@ or@@ en@@ z@@ o P@@ lu@@ m@@ bo .
At only 10 years , he has already won his place for the European cham@@ pion@@ ships in Copenhagen this year , and he likes nothing so much as he returns to competitors that exceed three heads .
The May@@ or of Tor@@ onto hi@@ j@@ acked journalists who came to ask him about drugs
In Canada , the may@@ or of Tor@@ onto is suspected of d@@ aring , according to several media .
A video of justice seems to support these suspic@@ ions .
The person concerned , Ro@@ b Ford , has always denied that he has consumed a pen@@ ny , while recognising that he has a pen@@ ny for can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
On Thursday , he expelled a number of journalists from his property .
We also believe that sometimes the images do not need explanation or comment .
A case of ra@@ b@@ b@@ le-@@ rou@@ sing
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of ra@@ b@@ ies had been detected in a ch@@ at@@ on in the V@@ al-@@ O@@ ise , clearly of foreign origin , while France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001 .
The ch@@ at@@ on was found on 25 October in Ar@@ g@@ na@@ us@@ il and he died on 28 October .
The ra@@ b@@ bit diagnosis was confirmed by the P@@ as@@ ti@@ er Institute .
&apos;@@ An epide@@ mi@@ ological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of people who could have come into contact with this ch@@ at@@ on between 8 October and 28 October included &apos; , &apos; specifies the ministries of health and agriculture .
&apos;@@ Five people who have been in contact with the ch@@ at@@ on have already been identified &apos; and have received preventive treatment .
&apos;@@ You are man , the preventive treatment of human ra@@ b@@ ies , administered after contact with the animal carrier , but before the symptoms appear , is very effective &apos; , specifies the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The ministries now call for people who would have been dead , d@@ run@@ ken , fed , or w@@ rap@@ ped on a mut@@ an@@ ship or skin , or whose animal would have been in contact with the ch@@ at@@ on between 8 and 28 October to contact 0@@ 8.@@ 1@@ 0.@@ 0@@ 6.@@ 95 between 10 and 6 p.m.
&apos;@@ Since France has been un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy of ra@@ b@@ ies since 2001 , this ch@@ at@@ on or the mother have been imported from another country , which is not free &apos; , according to the communi@@ qu@@ é .
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of &apos; indigenous &apos; ra@@ b@@ ies recorded goes back to December 1998 on a fo@@ ard and that &apos; France is declared officially un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed from this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for Animal Health ( O@@ I@@ E ) &apos; .
A case of ra@@ b@@ ies on an illegally imported chic@@ ken of G@@ am@@ bia was recorded in 2008 .
&apos;@@ D@@ ra@@ b@@ ies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time &apos; , rec@@ alls ministries and is trans@@ missible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease .
Obama ’ s Health Ch@@ all@@ enge
Under an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of criticism , President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “ if you are satisfied with your health regime , you can keep it . ”
After hundreds of thousands of people have received dis@@ approval opinions from their suppliers , the Republic@@ ans have criticised the President in the last few days , acc@@ using him of dec@@ ei@@ ving the American people .
Yesterday , Barack Obama adjusted his original promise .
“ The vast majority of people with health insurance that they deserve can keep it , ” he said in a speech in Bo@@ st@@ on .
O@@ wing to what he calls “ an up@@ surge in the current state of affairs , ” President Obama has encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market .

The happy election , J@@ ann@@ ke Vi@@ te P@@ re@@ ko@@ p , has combined the col@@ ours of the car brand and the German flag , while incorporating the no@@ tions of speed and heat into the run@@ -@@ off .

A resident in Au@@ ber@@ vil@@ y@@ ch
Let us not dec@@ eive ourselves , above all , .
In the spirit of Ab@@ d@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , his foun@@ der , the &apos; sub@@ ur@@ bs Party &apos; , is not just addressed to the ban@@ ds .
I have chosen a French card as a lo@@ go .
When I speak of sub@@ ur@@ bs , I address all those who are excluded from the large national family .
However , his project , presented on Thursday at the press conference in his native town of Au@@ ber@@ vil@@ le , was born of the desire to better defend multicul@@ tur@@ alism , this great cultural po@@ t which character@@ ises the neighbour@@ hoods .
My proposal No 1 is to create a minis@@ try for multicul@@ tur@@ alism .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine , 50 years , a territorial att@@ achment , now claims to be &apos; 100 % a@@ political &apos; , even though he has not always been neutral .
In 2002 , together with Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ch@@ ev@@ é@@ nez , he then supported Dom@@ ini@@ que de Vil@@ le@@ p@@ in locally between 2010 and 2011 .
I am well aware that the equality values that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left , but if right-wing people are prepared to support me , I will listen to them too .
There are only extremist parties that I am not talking about .
In addition to multicul@@ tur@@ alism , Ab@@ d@@ el-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ine has built his programme - consul@@ table on Inter@@ ol@@ an - from many subjects supposed to speak to sub@@ ur@@ bs and especially young people : the right to vote for foreigners , leg@@ alisation of can@@ n@@ ab@@ is , the civil majority at 16 , rehabilitation of the function of buildings .
It is still up to us to find candidates to form lists and to defend his ideas on the political scene &apos; .@@ for the 2014 municipal elections , that may be fair , admit &apos; .
It is a problem of time and money .
The sub@@ ur@@ bs Party should nevertheless be represented in Au@@ ber@@ vil@@ y@@ ch through my candi@@ d@@ acy and I also hope in other cities .
Ab@@ de@@ l-@@ M@@ ali@@ k D@@ j@@ er@@ m@@ ne already has seven heads of list in me@@ tro@@ polit@@ an France and Mart@@ ini@@ que .
&apos;@@ The support which I have received since yesterday is not all of a sub@@ ur@@ bs &apos; .
John Ker@@ ry admitted , without precedent , that American es@@ pion@@ age “ had gone too far . ”
John Ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ tening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programmes by ad@@ mitting , unprecedented , that on several occasions es@@ pion@@ age &apos; had gone too far &apos; .
The Secretary of State has also admitted that he , like Barack Obama , has ruled on “ automatic pilot ” when a series of inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory re@@ vel@@ ations of whis@@ tle@@ b@@ lowers Ed@@ ward S@@ now@@ den about the N@@ SA ’ s es@@ pion@@ age activities came into being .
The lea@@ ks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies .
Speaking at an Intergovernmental Conference in London by video link , Mr Ker@@ ry said : &apos; There is no doubt that the President , myself and other members of the government have learned some things in automatic pilot terms because we had the opportunity , from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War and then , of course , 11 September . &apos;
He then became the first high-@@ ranking member of the US government to admit that American es@@ pion@@ age had gone beyond the bounds , but insisted that everyone &apos;s rights had not been violated .
He said : “ In some cases it has gone too far . ”
The President is determined to try and clarify and make clear to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that nobody feels wrong .
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process .
Mr Ker@@ ry insisted , however , that the N@@ SA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
He added : “ We live in a new world where people are prepared to get out of hand . ”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people , explo@@ de them and attack governments .
And if you could inter@@ cep@@ t their communications and stop them before they act ?
We have prevented aircraft from falling , from explo@@ ding buildings and people to be murdered because we have been able to learn the facts in advance .
Meanwhile , US legislators will go to Europe to address concerns about the alleged American es@@ pion@@ age case and convince Europeans of the need to continue the joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States , and explained on Thursday the President of the Senate sub@@ committee on European affairs .
Sen@@ ator Ch@@ ris Mur@@ ph@@ y of the Con@@ nec@@ tic@@ t indicated that he had spoken before the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had posed to the possible withdrawal of anti-@@ terrorist organisations because of the sense of frustration that the monitoring of the National Security Agency ar@@ ouses .
&apos;@@ It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism &apos; , declared Mur@@ ph@@ y , a democr@@ at serving his first mandate , and chairman of the American Senate &apos;s Sub@@ committee on European Affairs , in an interview since Washington .
I will go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism , despite the anger caused by the N@@ SA programmes .
The press reports that the N@@ SA has cap@@ tured millions of communications in Europe , which has damaged relations with some US allies , but the Director of the agency said this week that it was not true and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned meta@@ ph@@ or that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States .
Other re@@ vel@@ ations reported on S@@ now@@ den documents that the N@@ SA had inter@@ cep@@ ted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other Heads of State .
The director of intelligence services , James C@@ tig@@ er , justified the es@@ pion@@ age of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was common practice on both sides .
In the tu@@ mul@@ t atmosphere , Mur@@ ph@@ y indicated that his office was organising a cong@@ res@@ sional trip to Congress this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and cham@@ bers .
The names of other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days .
He said that the route is still to be defined .
Mur@@ ph@@ y said that the purpose of this journey was to make it possible to improve relations , but also to act as a &apos; v@@ ile firm@@ ness &apos; .
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the kind of es@@ pion@@ age programmes they have been applying for years .
&apos;@@ We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans , but they must also understand that we are not the only people in the world to make es@@ pion@@ age &apos; .
Meanwhile , Ker@@ ry has planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to manage the ran@@ so@@ m generated by US strategies in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .
London ’ s stock market ended on Thursday , pl@@ agu@@ ed by S@@ hell ’ s bad results and the Fed ’ s announcement of continued economic support as expected .
A Austr@@ ali@@ an is using its prison sentence in Thailand in Thailand
A 21@@ -@@ year-old Sy@@ d@@ ney woman , sentenced to 15 days &apos; imprisonment in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et for wrongly claiming to have been attacked by a tax@@ i driver , appe@@ aled for judgment and has been put on trial .
Ste@@ life Ro@@ ch@@ le B@@ am@@ ford was first found guilty by a P@@ hu@@ k@@ et Court of Pro@@ v@@ ince on 15 June of false statements after telling the Tha@@ i police that a local tax@@ i driver , accompanied by two other men who were under control , attacked him early on Sunday 10 June .
However , video record@@ ings later revealed that she had returned to his ho@@ tel safely after he had separated from his small Austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
The P@@ hu@@ k@@ et police questioned B@@ am@@ ford for two days before she admitted that he invented the history of all parts .
It was held in a local office unit before the hearing before the court .
B@@ am@@ ford was sentenced to a 15@@ -@@ day prison sentence in a low-@@ security detention centre in the P@@ hu@@ k@@ et periphery , rather than in a prison for women .
This is the daughter of the former Austr@@ ali@@ an League of ru@@ g@@ by Peter Tun@@ ks ’ daughter , who appe@@ aled to Can@@ ber@@ ra ’ s Foreign Ministry to help his daughter .
Tun@@ ks told Sy@@ d@@ ney ’ s Sunday Te@@ leg@@ h that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s welfare and wanted it to return to Australia .
“ We have , of course , experienced a worrying moment , but we hope to bring it back to the house safely as soon as possible ” .
B@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled to the judgment and was released after the payment of 50 000 b@@ its .
In Australia , the press has said that , in the meantime , it was on holiday in the K@@ ra@@ bi region , southern Thailand .
Tha@@ i legal sources have indicated that B@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local P@@ hu@@ k@@ et lawyer , but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years &apos; imprisonment and imprisonment in a adult prison .
However , after the recent murder in P@@ hu@@ k@@ et of Mic@@ hel@@ le Sm@@ ith , a Austr@@ ali@@ an travel ag@@ ue , Thailand could also seek to re@@ kin@@ dle its damaged image with tourists , which could lead to acqu@@ it@@ tal .
The French police will stop Ander@@ le@@ ch@@ t f@@ ans from other than with R@@ S@@ B@@ A car@@ s .

&apos;@@ The bus con@@ voy will be es@@ cor@@ ted by the police since a former border post of Re@@ ke@@ m until the P@@ S@@ G stad@@ ium &apos; .
The same will be the case for the return to return .
&apos;@@ If other f@@ ans had an intention to go to Paris by other means , the French police pre@@ fec@@ te made it known that measures were taken to make arrests or even guards in sight &apos; , and yet again announced Mari@@ e Ver@@ be@@ ke .
Ta@@ ken together in French , the challenge of the Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ber@@ -B@@ ur@@ ge@@ o@@ ks school commission
At the Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -B@@ ur@@ ge@@ ys school committee 62 % of pupils have a mother tongue other than French .
This was a year ago that motivated a consultation with parents , pupils , teachers and members of education staff to reflect on how to better integrate pupils who live between different cultures .
The school committee has just un@@ ve@@ iled its vision of &apos; French together in French &apos; .
The V@@ ision diversity body has been going on for a year in schools to help pupils with all origins to discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language .
The discovery of neighbour@@ hoods , our architecture and our places are benchmarks .
Lar@@ ge names of writ@@ ers , artists , whether they were a s@@ nu@@ ff or have come from elsewhere .
Who are our buil@@ ders ?
&apos;@@ So we are creating projects so that they identify with all this &apos; , explains the President of V@@ ision diversity , A@@ id@@ da K@@ am@@ ar .
Michel V@@ ean , from the Institute of the New World , identified several challenges for the school committee .
&apos;@@ On the transmission , for example , of the qu@@ e@@ ue culture , the feeling of belonging , support for staff in the trans@@ forma@@ tions that we live in , in student cli@@ en@@ te@@ ers &apos; .
The Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ i@@ te@@ -B@@ ur@@ ge@@ y@@ s school committee has created a research centre which will provide tools for teachers who sometimes come from elsewhere .
