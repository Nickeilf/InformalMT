UK@@ IP ’ s dem@@ ons that refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example .
You talk about when Ni@@ gel Far@@ age says that the N@@ H@@ S should not pay for those who come to the UK to make health tourism , and when , with that in mind , he says yes when he specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the undesirable .
Firstly , you use speci@@ ous arguments and then dis@@ credit them with barely ve@@ iled hom@@ ophobia .
Wh@@ enever I or my family need the N@@ H@@ S , we have to qu@@ e@@ ue behind intoler@@ ants to chronic hypo@@ cr@@ ites that think they are due to them .
I think it is you who use speci@@ ous arguments .
Health tourism , as defined by the right of the right , hardly exists .
I believe that this is what is called democracy .
No one would be affected by UK@@ IP measures against health tourism , so there is no problem .
Only in the parallel UK@@ IP uni@@ verse can Car@@ s@@ ell appear as a revolutionary .
A quot@@ ation from a tor@@ ch is proof .
Yes , let us learn from the mess@@ eng@@ er .
The M@@ ail did not write the report , but only comment on it .
Those who control the majority of media in that country should be fired for spreading such populist propaganda as the reality .
I do not think you know what a speci@@ ous argument is .
You also know nothing about my personal situation or identity , so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of hom@@ ophobia .
Far@@ age was very surprised , but only because it is so rarely discussed .
He has made absolutely no hom@@ ophob@@ ic remarks .
You will have to succeed in getting you back .
I am not , of course , where you want to come , but I imagine you do not like when the media talk about what you do not like .
People talk so rarely because , unlike Far@@ age and his hidden follow@@ ers of That@@ cher who believe that AIDS and floods are a sign of God , not reflection about their own inability to understand that the comple@@ xi@@ ties of humanity are good , then no .
Ultimately the situation is as ri@@ fe in Ireland as in Spain .
With the new crisis in the period of austerity , nothing has been done .
E@@ arly 5 % growth in 2015 is a big jo@@ ke .
We were bo@@ ast@@ ed in Ireland by the European T@@ T@@ ER@@ E in the E@@ PP@@ -@@ E@@ D .
We have seen the following !
This re@@ hear@@ sed the article .
The attempt is being made to make the impression that Ireland is a virtu@@ ous country and that one of the N@@ O@@ U@@ V@@ E@@ U M@@ IR@@ AC@@ E EC@@ ON@@ O@@ I@@ Q@@ EU is taking place .
With the Brussels agreement , im@@ po@@ tent on the lowest soci@@ alities in Europe , a move towards flexible work and a continuing emi@@ gration .
With these sc@@ are@@ mon@@ g@@ ering , it is not enough to po@@ pp@@ y with the Poles .
In the 1980 ’ s of the 20@@ 8@@ 0s , it was one of the poorest countries in the Euro@@ phil@@ e Union , with Portuguese in view of a constant per@@ im@@ e@@ ter , without the new@@ com@@ ers , the situation is always better than it was .
The Green has come to the fore .
That their development was not a long calm river , it was on the basis of the recent break@@ throu@@ gh@@ s .
With the lowest im@@ po@@ s in Europe ?
That is not true !
Latvia has an im@@ po@@ t rate of 0 % on businesses .
Now there is a hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on the im@@ po@@ s paid by multinationals .
According to a report from 2008 or 2009 , they pay in France less than 5 % in gen@@ al .
Only small and medium-sized enterprises pay .
Now I confirm that road cir@@ cu@@ its have become bo@@ gged down , and there are new cars ( and che@@ re ) in the streets , just as before the 2008 crisis .
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years , the recovery is evident in the daily but@@ tons since the entry .
Is this supposed to be economic news ?
Do not worry , I am sure that the comments will soon so@@ ar .
In another article that they are writing , 2 V@@ au@@ x@@ ram@@ l A@@ str@@ a is involved in a st@@ agg@@ ering A@@ 140 .
Is R@@ y@@ an@@ air now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way ?
I believe that Mr O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of appli@@ ances , so a few bo@@ xes and f@@ ences on the old will soon be forgotten .
Having said that , I am voting with him next week , so I hope that it will not be on one of these .
That would be entirely the fault of the other pilot .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air has made passengers pay extra for the additional fear that they have been willing to provide ?
But without this kind of Irish company you could not allow you to go on holiday , young man young man .
I have never taken R@@ y@@ an@@ air and the last three times I took the plane with B@@ A .
I prefer when the airline proposes a quality service .
No , but it is R@@ y@@ an@@ air , so they can get to heart .
Any article on R@@ y@@ an@@ air trigg@@ ers dozens of comments by people who would never take R@@ y@@ an@@ air to those who like to take R@@ y@@ an@@ air and think that those who pay other than the basic tariff have to attack themselves .
This is fairly transparent .
R@@ y@@ an@@ air will not be happy with the additional costs of this incident .
I wonder what the delays will be and whether we will have to compensate passengers and , if so , if R@@ y@@ an@@ air is going to be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake by airport air traffic contro@@ l@@ lers .
Pass@@ eng@@ ers have been placed in another aircraft in less than an hour , they have no right to compensation .
Please dis@@ appoint you and your dreams of compensation .
Welcome to the British Air@@ ways flight that takes the English I@@ SIS to Syria , not as you say .
Good Tra@@ vel@@ y@@ age
Last Sunday in Paris , the streets of the Frank@@ fur@@ t , the Mar@@ is is largely pe@@ anu@@ ts , and it is literally a group of world .
People do not come to a mass for the quality of restaur@@ ants ( most of them ) , or for the B@@ on of B@@ lan@@ d-@@ Man@@ te@@ x ( hy@@ per@@ -@@ intellectual and slightly d@@ ust ) .
The reason for this crow@@ d is that the shops are all open and that the neigh@@ bor@@ hood is incredibly alive and lively .
Together with many foreigners who spend ...
Do you believe that the opening of Sunday will create jobs ?
Al@@ to a Paris R@@ ue of Fran@@ ques Bour@@ ge@@ is , where shops are opened on the Chan@@ nel , which is being spent on 50 % of tourists .
Four al@@ o@@ es !
The only argument that seems admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nu@@ an@@ ced by the fact that they buy duty-free .
The tourist areas lose a huge amount of turnover every year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment , exploited by the Chan@@ nel , can lower prices .
Sunday rest is a right which , except for exceptions , benefits employees .
That is why it is planned and regulated by the code of work .
Neither the Minister for the Econom@@ y nor , indeed , the Foreign Affairs Minister , have any competence whatsoever to reform the labour code .
As they close it .
Does the law serve what ?
To satisfy some of the people and businesses that wish to work on the Chan@@ nel .
In Mon@@ tre@@ al on Sunday I take my small children to the municipal libr@@ ary .
In my V@@ ille of 30@@ ,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal bi@@ b@@ lical is open four days a week but not !
That is access to culture ...
It is also the regulation of working time .
The way in which he has fought with ten@@ acity against fascism
F@@ as@@ c@@ ism and Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ m
And if his daughter ’ s succession was , against his will , used to pay the succession costs ?
There are pain@@ ts .
Some are good .
Perhaps his succession would like his share of the ca@@ ke , if you get me .
His preference for a victory for nation@@ alists / Fran@@ co in the Spanish civil war ...
And its hostility to independence in places like Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add to its well-known hatred of Jews .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill was not perfect .
Nor do I .
But for five years , and only for five years , it was perfect .
In 19@@ 40 , he held his head in the government ’ s other ar@@ is@@ os who wanted to discuss an “ agreement ” with the Naz@@ is , and he won very sk@@ il@@ fully .
Thanks to his wonderful rhetoric and energy , he united the country in the idea that fighting fasc@@ ists was the only way to win .
The people of the United Kingdom , France , and Belgium and , ultimately , the whole world , can thank God for having had these five years , just those five years , Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill at the hel@@ m and no other .
Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill &apos;s great@@ ness has nothing to do with this discussion .
If his des@@ c@@ endants sell pain@@ ts on the free market to collect the money from inher@@ it@@ ance costs , they could even make a profit .
If the public wants to ad@@ mire one in a mus@@ e@@ um , they collect money to buy it .
It is as simple as that . It is as simple as that .
But we could use tax money .
No one can deny that , when it was “ the moment of truth , ” Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill ’ s personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War .
A rela@@ un@@ ching of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies , which will increase their divi@@ den@@ ds by not hi@@ ring , as infrastructure shipyards are by definition un@@ renewable .
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister , they reflect the real evil : distrust of dialogue .
Re@@ al to Pr@@ inc@@ es .
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory .
That the weakest among us is not in need !
Either collectively we come to help , or he has , in exchange for the services he ren@@ ders or has given to a minimum of resources .
The S@@ M@@ 40@@ H that I prefer to s@@ mile corresponds to that vision .
There is also the donor who lives on income from his properties .
There is a need to differenti@@ ate the person who in@@ ve@@ sts for a return to retirement and who lives on his rents .
One thing to lau@@ gh , or two for a couple above , is vice versa .
The small gen@@ i@@ us of finance is lacking in imagination .
The new deal was a policy of major works , but at a time of major infrastructure failure .
Today , in Europe and France , this is not the case .
Develop@@ ed countries are super@@ se@@ ded .
The need for infrastructure is therefore marginal in no way to a new deal .
Especially at a time when the issue of growth is emerging in response to a recession that is nothing but a brutal de@@ growth in the wild .
You would have been right 30 years ago : the need ( or possibilities ) for dam@@ s , coal mines , motorways ...
But if we want to make the future climate climate shock less severe , then the need for investment is glar@@ ing : isolation , re@@ novation of the rail network , urban transport , transport and storage of energy .
A tax that favours high incomes and broadband .

Sam@@ sun@@ g ’ s profits are being damaged by the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 and its competitors of the same spectrum
The introduction of Ap@@ ple by Ap@@ ple in mid-@@ September over@@ shad@@ owed the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 and 6 plus .
I have tested all these tele@@ phones and decided for L@@ G@@ G G@@ 3 .
So Sam@@ sun@@ g lost me as a customer , but not to Ap@@ ple .
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative .
When Micro@@ soft put in place that philosophy , we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken down by Google , Ap@@ ple , and the op@@ en community .
We need to have several dynamic platforms , to stimulate competition and development .
In addition , we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer , because they are not compatible .
For me , I tend to buy Ap@@ ple , because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design .
Some people do not attach value to design , for them the options , the func@@ tionality and the price .
There is nothing wrong with that .
Let us stop looking for a better platform .
There is a &apos; better car manufacturer &apos; , not really , they are different but similar .
I would like to see a thri@@ ving port@@ able industry , with radically different approaches for people and different markets .
This is healthier and must be encouraged .
That is in all our interests .
I am pleased that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that it is not an Ap@@ ple product , although I have made a different choice .
Most of the people I know have i@@ P@@ hon@@ es .
Our colleague , who is in one of them fighting ideas and not men ( on the contrary , on Paris b@@ ob@@ s ) could tell us what ( the author is ) when they fight ideas about gender and tell us what works they intend to combat .
Or are they just attacking the gender as described in the Fi@@ gar@@ o , Min@@ u@@ te , or Val@@ ers Pro@@ ject ?
Their sources are Ju@@ di@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler or Eri@@ c Z@@ em@@ m@@ our ?
Well , Jean , I like you , and you are an intelligent and educated person .
I said that on Ju@@ di@@ ith in the F@@ ur@@ us@@ to ve@@ in , which was mentioned by Hol@@ oph@@ er@@ in , which did not come to me ( I do not have his vi@@ vi@@ d spirit ) .
Otherwise , in the &apos; substance &apos; , since you refer it back to it , I am not interested in it , and I sincerely do not see where the problem is : I hoped you and your friends could get me out of my back@@ l@@ ash , because I am slow but I understand ...
Four : recognise that , cul@@ turally , sending Ju@@ di@@ ith back to Hol@@ oph@@ er@@ ine is doing so .
Who is afraid of the World ?
But what about those who are afraid ?
F@@ ur@@ as@@ to and 4 give us answers .
The first by invo@@ king the Bi@@ ble of the Bi@@ ble , the second by describing Ju@@ di@@ ith Bu@@ t@@ ler as a very symbolic c@@ at .
We can see how in@@ tim@@ ate these studies are .
We are , of course , no longer in the debate .
That is something else , much more profound .
Did you read , Jean , that the Mon@@ de published an article on the need for the@@ ology ?
Four : when it comes to a debate of ideas , I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources .
To try to combat ideas based solely on what their critics are doing ( Car@@ d@@ inal R@@ atz@@ inger , the inven@@ tor of the Gen@@ re of Gen@@ re or X , the@@ olo@@ gi@@ an ) does not seem very rigorous .
But it is good , as I explained to our friend , the author , that it is the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion .
I am not , moreover , in favour of the nu@@ ance .
I did not read Ju@@ di@@ ith , the very symbolic g@@ ate of g@@ or@@ ge , I was content with the &apos; second sex &apos; ( it was more than my time ) which I believe is the source of the &apos; source &apos; according to L@@ o .
While I watched the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se from M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , I saw red lights when the mo@@ on briefly demonstrated when the cl@@ ou@@ ds opened .

That was wonderful here in F@@ N@@ Q .

I was in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne then , of course , I saw only cl@@ ou@@ ds .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne has also been able to cover himself throughout the week of the Per@@ se@@ an@@ ides of the Per@@ se@@ i@@ des and for almost all the major astr@@ on@@ om@@ ical events of recent years .
I am beginning to think that there is a bad gen@@ i@@ us whose sole aim is to prevent the people of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne from seeing anything from the sky .
M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne is really not the best place for an observatory , even if things improve greatly on the other side of the Cor@@ dic@@ ill@@ er .
There were periods of 10@@ -@@ 20 minutes in which I could not see the ec@@ li@@ p@@ se because of cl@@ ou@@ ds over the sub@@ ur@@ bs of M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .

The Ministry of Econom@@ ics tells us that these claims for compensation are unfounded .
What should the Ministry of Econom@@ ics do ?
Will policymakers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack on the no@@ tar@@ ies will have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget ?
The next time round .
O@@ k , thank you , J@@ Y@@ L ..@@ .@@ .
The government is not comparable to households when it comes to managing its budget , because the time horizon of the state is theore@@ tically infin@@ ite , while the household is constrained by its members ’ lif@@ es@@ p@@ an .
Moreover , unless we consider that public spending is un@@ productive , these are helping to finance material and int@@ an@@ gible investments in the growth of tomorrow and hence future revenue .
A few points of response .
This is a regrettable decision .
But remember the sac@@ red o@@ ath of Hi@@ p@@ po@@ crates : the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all .
Jo@@ lie theory .
Unfortunately , the truth is not your fant@@ asy .
Med@@ ical staff would like to be able to use them , but they have their hands tied by the law as written by politicians .
This is the same as for the product that causes medical abor@@ tions rather than risky sur@@ ger@@ y , safe s@@ ho@@ ot rooms for drug addic@@ ts rather than having them on the streets etc .
On these issues politicians want to please the accused m@@ asses .
In fact , doctors do not earn money with medicines .
That is why there are pharmac@@ ists .
Do@@ c@@ tors do not earn money from medicines because the Liberals want our health system to resemb@@ le that of the United States , you should know how it works .
In the world , doctors are treated in the same way , but that is more or less visible .
It was perhaps wrong to blame the tu@@ bes , but the reality is that many countries , including Australia , give priority to business profits and research .
So please read the few reports on our spending on P@@ harm@@ ac@@ eu@@ tical Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ ts Sch@@ em@@ e and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries .
Com@@ par@@ ing world prices for medicines everywhere , as well as differences between countries on what is on free or just prescri@@ ption .
This is a political and economic process , not a medical or scientific , direct or indirect process .
In fact , some companies are currently carrying out tests on mari@@ ju@@ ana in@@ hal@@ ations against on@@ co@@ logical pain , despite the laws that bra@@ ke them and the costly permits needed .
Although the manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as mari@@ ju@@ ana are being used , those who arrive at a version offering good quality products to known do@@ ses will benefit greatly .
To tell you , but you are wrong , a lot is happening in the corridors for doctors and pharmac@@ ists .
As for the hospital , they were happy to use it until someone put the chi@@ p on the ear of a hospital official .

If “ researchers ” in social science made research rather than politics and net@@ working , one could use their “ work . ”
A resear@@ cher is not compared with another .
Com@@ par@@ ing that is not the way to go .
Under@@ standing it is not research .
It cannot be said that research is successful , and then in the same j@@ et ‘ we must experiment to everything ’ .
If your research is successful , why experiment ?
If your research is not successful why do you ask you to apply them ?
Can one explain to me how a “ resear@@ cher ” can deduc@@ t that a pup@@ il who cannot as@@ simil@@ ate mathema@@ tics can as@@ simil@@ ate mathema@@ tics and other matters more easily ?
New technologies make it possible to learn that pupils learn to use new technologies , but how would they manage to learn new technologies if they do not know ?
The p@@ ist@@ a tests are just an indicator that makes it possible to find indicators that are satisfactory to us .
What is the point of building an indicator that tells you what suits you , a desire for self-@@ promotion and dec@@ eption ?
A single line to train teachers : moving away from training and ideolo@@ gues and practi@@ sing practi@@ tioners to practi@@ tioners .
It re@@ read the paragraph on tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hi@@ ps ( which unfortunately is not very argued ) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conser@@ va@@ tism : ‘ It is a mechanism that leads above all to the reproduction of existing practices , and does not allow the system to move forward ’ .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system , it cannot be hoped that only practi@@ tioners teach practi@@ tioners , even if they have their place in modern teacher training .
Education the@@ or@@ ists must have no place .
The practi@@ tioners must have one .
Would you want to be operated by a sur@@ ge@@ on whose training is purely theoretical , and who has never set foot in a previously operating bloc ?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system .
To give more weight to education the@@ or@@ ists would be to destroy it definitively .
Your analo@@ gy is all too f@@ ateful : if I do not wish to be operated by a practi@@ tion@@ er who has a theoretical training , I would like to be even less able to operate by a sur@@ ge@@ on who has no theoretical training and who has learned about it .

Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright , I will only read an article like this .
In an information economy , the infringement of copyright is a flight .
That is the same as they have to quote their sources properly .
Often , obtaining a licence does not cost anything .
No , it is a violation of copyright .
Not the same thing .
By using content without the proper licence , you are depriving the artists of their livelihood .
You can always debate educational assumptions - but it is flight .
And you can repeat that as much as you like , but that will not be true .
It is a violation of copyright .
Let me repeat it again .
If I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright copyright
Clearly , it does not b@@ other you to deprive artists of their income .
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties , an almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use , then I am glad to deprive them of this shadow income .
The lesson should be to show how , if children themselves create anything and publish it on their fav@@ our@@ ite social networks , they abandon all intellectual property to the site under the general conditions they have passed from a c@@ lic@@ k .

I have two children and when they will be of choice , I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then .
France is pul@@ ling people down by constantly assisting them .
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created .
What is driving France down to the bottom is speeches like yours .
Ab@@ gu@@ es I have been working on private business .
I had the C@@ HA@@ N@@ EC for working in companies run by excellent business leaders : it exists in France , but it is rare .
I am employed because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company , and that choice allows me to s@@ cra@@ p the dark bos@@ ses that I often encounter .
At home in my bas@@ kets I fully share the post of Jean-@@ Pi@@ er@@ re Ber@@ na@@ j@@ z@@ an : he says the horrific truth !
Four , if one com@@ pa@@ res with German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly cite reforms in France , in Germany , companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive , particularly by ensuring the link between big business and small and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French bos@@ ses waiting for ?
Should the State hold its hands ?
Is this state that they are guilty of being punished ?
4.@@ Jacques L@@ . L@@ . L@@ . L@@ . L@@ . L@@ . L@@ . L@@ . L@@ .
This is an anti-@@ business cr@@ unch on your part !
Rem@@ ember , what has you created as employment , as added value , to be as strict ?
I understand your reaction .
In fact , France is faced with an in@@ solu@@ ble problem : the in@@ competence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who move and min@@ al while waiting for the permanent help of the state !
It is terrible !
But they have solutions : to abolish the Lab@@ or Code , employers &apos; taxes , taxes , work 4@@ 5@@ th / week paid 35 , and some , wal@@ king on eggs , dare to demand a reduction in wages , if not deletion !
I look forward to seeing all the negative comments on this subject .
What is ironic is the way in which people always complain about First Group .
As I see it , L@@ ast has not really been an investment for us taxpayers .
They have tried to stay af@@ lo@@ at rather than transform themselves .
It does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since L@@ ast has dealt with it .
But they also improved with their predecessors , including British R@@ ail .
Unfortunately , we do not have the power to do that .
I tried to have them recently , but I did not succeed .
But the Labour Party is going to get us out of trouble .
It is an international subsidiary .
They already operate trains in Germany .
It does not prevent people in the UK from creating a more moral business and participating in ten@@ ders .
But it seems that we are not very good in management , most of our priv@@ ati@@ sed services end up being managed by a foreign operator .
I still remember the scandal and criticism when F@@ ir@@ st won the Vir@@ g@@ in contract , all of which so that the decision is finally cancelled .
And there is better : T@@ T@@ R , a Hong Kong company won the F@@ T@@ T operation for eight years .
Well , the Labour Party , as they told us during the referendum campaign , is completely in favour of po@@ oling and sharing , and believes that workers must all help each other across borders .
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision .
It is perhaps because Dutch management is on the right track when that of the British is not .
What S@@ co@@ t@@ R@@ ail needs is not just a change of owner but above all new ideas .
A@@ bel@@ li@@ o may be the least bad choice , but the real problem is the ridiculous system of travel , not the catch .
&apos;@@ It was a burning daughter &apos; .
I hate , but I really hate this kind of expression .
To assume that being &apos; beaten &apos; is a higher quality than many others , the concern of others , intelligence , listening to , for example , being &apos; beaten &apos; has nothing to do with the survival of a disease : &apos; batter@@ y &apos; canc@@ ers , who are no less dead .
C@@ reat@@ ing a disease has nothing to do with merit .
Let us start again .
I say to you that it is L@@ A which is a condition for managing , I say A@@ F@@ DE .
Nothing can be seen with any merit ...
The example of your life is only you to judge them .
I would like to start again .
In@@ tro@@ duc@@ ing , even for a moment , that you can have merit in getting out of a disease or that we can de@@ value from not getting out of it , is simply mon@@ str@@ ous .
The body follows or does not follow .
A body that cowar@@ dly , despite the will , despite confidence in medicine , has a vague idea of what C ?
To think otherwise , if a strong morality is likely to make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it , to seek experimental treatment as this woman has done and not to refuse them out of fear .
Some@@ one who is beaten in medicine is primarily someone who tru@@ sts medicine .
But if you prefer to rely on the &apos; l@@ ord &apos; that is something else .
Neither with merit nor with courage .
These considerations are specific to mor@@ alists .
When you catch a sal@@ t , a real one , you are getting rid of just a z@@ om@@ bi@@ e .
Personally , I have caught two , sal@@ i and big , and if I have &apos; fought &apos; as these psycho@@ log@@ ists say , it has completely escap@@ ed me .
Unless this fight is just to tighten the te@@ eth , to suffer the hell and to bur@@ y the b@@ lows .
I thought the accusation against Milosevic was decided and finalised ten years ago .
I have not seen the name in the newspapers since at least that time .
What is happening ?
It is a anniversary .
A forgotten birth@@ day .
His trial was conducted &apos; quickly &apos; and then swept under the car@@ pet .
Is this the story that was told at the time ?
The nation@@ alistic Commun@@ ists who unle@@ ashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade ?
The Communist President of the Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please ask , therefore , what has been deliberately left aside : 1 .
How could NATO bom@@ bar@@ d@@ ment be legal under M@@ A M@@ O@@ IN@@ D@@ R@@ E rule of international law ?
What country has Serbia attacked ?
With regard to R@@ DR@@ s ( Rad@@ io Tele@@ vision on Serbia ) , why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then regarded it as a valid target .
Milosevic had no way out of it : if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks , he would be cru@@ ci@@ fied as a tra@@ itor .
If he defended him , he would be sw@@ am@@ ped by the Western ste@@ am@@ rol@@ ler .
The West used a smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en to de@@ part from a sovereign state that then unilaterally declared its independence and was strongly recognised by the Western states , which then li@@ ed to the end of the situation on the ground .
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared ( ethnic cleansing ) .
Vo@@ j@@ is@@ la@@ v Ko@@ st@@ unic@@ a , who is mentioned here , died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed .

Ultimately , the Guar@@ dian should not call Milosevic a ty@@ rant ( even if we do not like it ) .
As far as I am aware , only in Greece is a method of predic@@ tion of earthquakes moving around , by measuring the pi@@ ge@@ zo@@ electric level in the quar@@ tz .
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results .
So there is hope , but caution has nothing to do with the O@@ T@@ T@@ -@@ P-@@ 1@@ 1@@ b , located at about 1@@ 24 light years of the earth in the C@@ y@@ gn@@ us Con@@ st@@ ellation , which would be “ the smallest and most cold planet to present detec@@ table water m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules . ”
So M@@ eth@@ od needs to be followed up .
Just like those involving animals that are threatening a threat .
Thank you very much , Mr P@@ ass@@ er of science , for the fact that we are often governed by these experimental achievements in the world .
How would animals be able ( in advance ) ?
Perhaps through the perception of other factors that are changing in the event of earthquake .
Like the ra@@ don , for example , it is a ra@@ don .
A gas is in@@ od@@ ous for man , but perhaps for the animals .
All these methods are in@@ trac@@ table for man , but not for the measuring instruments at it .
But we do not have a reliable result on these paths …
It has been observed many times ( and for centuries ) that some animals act strange hours with an earthquake , including h@@ ens , cows , dogs , and especially fish and dry .
I had seen a head@@ line that told the struggle of two scientific teams , one Califor@@ n@@ ian , the other Japanese , to recognize the validity of their work that related to the sensitivity of animals to land mag@@ netic fields , and in particular to their change before a se@@ m .
Well , I am not scientific , but their assumptions had convinced me !
Or what about this research ?
Why so much contempt for this ?
We should learn to listen to nature ...
If we look at it cal@@ m@@ ly and rigorously , it is published in a serious jour@@ nal .
As soon as we talk about the “ signs ” given by animals , there is the same way : everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the red fish was strange in round .
I do not understand that Bor@@ is would be a good leader for Conservatives .
He did too much as May@@ or of London .
When you listen to the L@@ BC programme one cannot help thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he is always trying to di@@ version with a jo@@ ke .
It never responds directly to it .
He also said he agreed with Far@@ age , and then N@@ ick F@@ err@@ ari has asked him what .
He could not name one point .
He has made so many promises to elect himself as may@@ or and he did not hold one .
This only highlights the extent to which the rest of the Conservative Party is only a r@@ ash of mer@@ ch@@ ant , not ?
It is because he is popular .
Because it is fun@@ ny .
He was in H@@ a@@ ve I .
Because it is a cele@@ bri@@ d and people have been accused of ad@@ mitting cele@@ bri@@ ties .
Lon@@ don@@ ers voted for him , and the same applies to the rest of the country .
When ( and not if ) he takes the party ’ s leadership , the T@@ ories ’ popularity ratings will cut the ceiling , I am sure .
Let God help us .
I am not so sure : people like bl@@ ag@@ ers , but do not want their prime minister to be one .
That is exactly what the Lon@@ don@@ ers said .
He should have brought his friend , smar@@ ter , more intelligent than he was .
In many respects , I think he is trying to copy R B@@ ran@@ son

Bon@@ evening , I think that the red ba@@ g that demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British region and the V@@ ille de Br@@ est .
More seriously , it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a si@@ gh of our taxes to finance the dreams of a few even friendly ad@@ ven@@ tu@@ rers .
Are there any players in the current Serbian training of Koso@@ van origin ?
I know that D@@ us@@ an B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic in L@@ y@@ on and Mil@@ os K@@ ra@@ si@@ c , once to the Ju@@ ven@@ tus and now to Fe@@ er@@ ba@@ hai , is Mit@@ ro@@ vic@@ a , but I do not know whether they are still in the team .
The defen@@ der of L@@ y@@ on , not B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic was the ground , or before the 1970s and 1980s , and brought many teams in Greece , but I do not know where he is .
B@@ aj@@ e@@ vic is Mo@@ star , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and played as attacked in the large team of Vel@@ ez , who , under the le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary S@@ ul@@ le@@ an Re@@ b@@ c , ended twice in the Yugoslav League ( and also had r@@ ings like V@@ a@@ hi@@ d H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and the loyal equi@@ er of Ar@@ s@@ è@@ ne W@@ eng@@ er , Bor@@ o Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c ) .
Well , thank you .
Of course I know H@@ ali@@ l@@ ho@@ d@@ z@@ ic and Pri@@ mor@@ a@@ c .
By cu@@ ri@@ osity , what happened to K@@ ra@@ si@@ c ?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in the Ju@@ ve , he is currently in Turkey , but the last time he appeared on my ra@@ d@@ ar scre@@ en , he was linked to Bl@@ ack@@ bur@@ n , who is a soft man in the home .
I cannot help you here .
I know he lost his place when Con@@ te arrived and then went to the Fe@@ er and as far as I know he is not .
Perhaps he can still do something , perhaps in the Indian Sup@@ per League ?
Ser@@ iously , Serbia .
Albania , in particular , is not afraid .
You should love Albania because you are neighbours .
The tr@@ ick is that the flag of this dr@@ one is not the flag of the true Albania of today .
Ap@@ parently it was the flag of the Great Albania , which encomp@@ asses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence .
A bit of excessive nationalism .
Fortunately , there was not too much damage ( as I know ) .
In fact , it was an Albanian flag with the map not of the so-called Great Albania , but of Albania from before 19@@ 13 , when the great European powers decided to give the country &apos;s stra@@ ins to neighbouring countries .
How can we have felt &apos; an explosion of joy &apos; when seeing two rounds collap@@ sing in the knowledge that women , men and no doubt children are inside ?
How is it possible ?
What bo@@ thers me in this &apos; testi@@ mony &apos; is that the only fact that , at least once , we have been able spontane@@ ously to rejo@@ ice in the horrific death of thousands of people , shows me a &apos; close line &apos; person@@ ality of all &apos; testi@@ monies &apos; .
It is no doubt that , in the short term of &apos; joy &apos; , we will not have thought about the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted .
It will only be thought , for a moment , that , for once , Muslims had managed to make a real and apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ tic contribution to the great Sa@@ tan in his very heart .
A powerful q@@ q@@ ich .
There is a great deal to be done .
It seems that this sentiment has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been sh@@ attered by their sense of humiliation .
With testi@@ monies in Palestine .

This was a little doubtful .
The &quot; Christian / white &quot; West cannot measure the degree of che@@ ating , anger and hatred of mu@@ su@@ man when it con@@ tri@@ ved the fur@@ nit@@ ure of poverty , social and cultural under@@ development in the Muslim Arab@@ -@@ Muslim world .
I am talking about the do@@ or@@ step of Cairo or Al@@ gi@@ ers , not Dub@@ i tow@@ ers .
The past s@@ aga , certainly mag@@ ni@@ fied , is not cons@@ ol@@ ation , on the contrary .
How can we get the Muslim world out of this evil des@@ k ?
T@@ yp@@ ically in phase , two major pois@@ ons ir@@ rig@@ ate the Arab world : conservative conser@@ va@@ tism of the powers in place and fascist ni@@ hil@@ ism .
The common point , the freezing of thought and ex@@ communication ( soft or army ) of its critical expression .
It should not be understood before , that Muslims should not be allowed to back up .
That is the only way .

I assume that this is true in many countries .
In Britain , however , the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark , we@@ t@@ lands , and de@@ pres@@ s@@ ants that affect the well-being and mood of many people .
Moreover , everyone is sick .
seasonal pressure .
I myself am suffering .
When the light goes , it becomes hell for me and those like me .
A do@@ se of vitam@@ in D should help the mood and well-being .
The autumn is beautiful in Britain , with or without rain .
The campaign in particular is to bur@@ st in the autumn .
Not as much to cut back as the summer of the summer when everything is alive , rather than being on the ver@@ ge of dying .
In Britain , if you are lucky , the summer falls a weekend .
We have had a good summer this year , do not make your g@@ lim@@ p@@ se , which is giving up c@@ lic@@ h@@ és !
Not everyone is .
I sel@@ dom fall ill in winter .
But now I am reti@@ red and I do not have any more immunity to the ger@@ ms of the outside , and that can change .
It is not about to die , it is just a step in a cycle ...
A mar@@ vel@@ l@@ ous step full of st@@ agg@@ ering sm@@ ell , with a fe@@ e@@ ble fe@@ at , culmin@@ ating in cele@@ bra@@ tions such as H@@ all@@ we@@ en , Gu@@ y F@@ aw@@ ks , Christmas , the risks of en@@ vy and other wonderful words .
Let us not stop doing things !
These are my recommendations for you .
Yes , these dark and grey months make me much happ@@ ier and more rela@@ xed .
For the taxation of children &apos;s inc@@ rements , it is the amount collected by the state that comes mainly from the dec@@ lines 8 to 10 .
However , when it comes to the number of households who have seen their taxes increased as a result of this measure , it is mainly the 4 and 5 who are affected ( medi@@ an income ) according to the graph@@ ics 2 .
The deletion of half a part of the wid@@ ows is not covered at all in the article or , rather , its impact is wo@@ efully assessed : EUR 2@@ 30@@ M is a jo@@ ke that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 .
And it is not ready to settle .
Well , we are not on the stra@@ w of admittedly , but s@@ lack .
For once the PS makes a policy that is rather left-wing , we will not la@@ ment ...
Clearly , those who are among the richest 20 % have to bear much more than 75 % of the tax increase , why not 90 % ?
Let us continue with this , and you will encourage the 20 % to work less or leave .
Well , I know that this is not politically correct , but I do say that .
L@@ ong the Tro@@ ts and S@@ P@@ Is recyc@@ led to the PS : they understood everything .
Adam , you see very little what you are looking at .
The proportion is always the same , here or in Bah@@ rain : 20 % of the population holds 80 % of the wealth .
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from am@@ assing as much as they can .
In addition to a certain limit , money loses its usefulness .
And once we have exceeded the value of money , the money is only used to make money , that is to say , to make the most of the mis@@ fortune .
It is one of the richest 20 % .
Perhaps the 20 % of households that work most ( and create wealth , some of which are logically re@@ distributed ) .
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of some of their efforts .
Or , if we are to have social housing , we will have to cut back and live with social minim@@ ums .
Fortunately , the ut@@ op@@ ia of the war@@ mon@@ g@@ ering to the red h@@ ull have lived .
I made two Air@@ B@@ n@@ B in Norway recently .
There is no problem with this .
In one of the two , we have had things that we would not have had in a ho@@ tel 5 st@@ ars and we did not have to get to the reception or to deal with the slightest trace .
You only need to go to someone , sle@@ ep , stand behind and leave .
From now on it will be my first option when I travel .

I ad@@ mire Air@@ b@@ n@@ b .
“ This is very dangerous and highly risky , ” not the truth .
You have just missed luck .
According to the link provided in the article :
The answer from Air@@ b@@ n@@ b to T@@ em@@ an was rapid , almost absurd .
Within 24 hours , according to an e-mail provided to G@@ aw@@ ker by T@@ em@@ an , Air@@ b@@ n@@ b had sent a ser@@ ren@@ ry to change ser@@ f@@ s , taken provisions to spend a week at the ho@@ tel and transfer $ 23 8@@ 17 ( for which Air@@ b@@ n@@ b is assured but nonetheless ) .
So why does this article quote T@@ em@@ an complaining that it has not received any support from Airbus ?
I have A@@ IR@@ E A@@ IR@@ B@@ N@@ B - to receive as to travel .
I am looking for people who have already used b@@ ung@@ s just to reassure me .
I intend to pay a month and a month to go down at a stro@@ ke , but I am rather afraid of sending GBP 1 600 to a site that I have never heard about .

“ Sup@@ porting troops , ” s@@ ang the B@@ u ’ s B@@ u on all sides …
So harm@@ less .
I am sure that will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds dead in Hal@@ ab@@ ja to learn that their parents and friends have succum@@ bed to anything other than the chemical bombing of the s@@ ad@@ bre .
Unless the content of the article was radically amended by the author , your comment is in@@ at@@ propri@@ ated ( to remain pol@@ ite ) .
Moreover , how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still us@@ able ?
The author ’ s style is not clear : “ In the search for weapons of mass destruction .
We agree with that .
You believe that this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education .
This is never the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war .
Al@@ ter@@ na@@ tives : is it TO@@ U@@ J@@ O@@ UR@@ S the time to strengthen education , because we are still at war ?
There would already be a great deal more education if ‘ them ’ were to work 35 hours instead of 17 .
At present , our teachers are gaining more than engineers .
We do not believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their programme .
But that is not true , because National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the college / school to its pro@@ s , so they are feeding home .
A kind of forced tele@@ labour in sum , except that the employer does not pay the computer , the Internet connection or supplies .
Moreover , it is so much the floor that at 17@@ .@@ 00 a week and 4 months of vac@@ ation that we manage to fill the CA@@ P@@ S of ma@@ ath@@ s , come , you expect .
How do you not want to ped@@ dle you with poorly educated chi@@ ves whose parents are cr@@ ying out for you ?

Where one sees that the Bush administration has absolutely done everything in its power .
My first gradu@@ ate job was the sale in London to earn three times nothing , but it was a job for which a qualification was needed .
A year later , I saw an announcement to be working for the London me@@ tr@@ o , it was paid GBP 5 000 per year and was not even asked for a patent .
I have never regret@@ ted the fact that I have been sorry .
In this respect , you do not do this if you do not find a gradu@@ ate job , try to find something that pays well , or that you like to do .
If I had stay@@ ed in gradu@@ ate jobs , I would still pay my student loan .
I do not like work in business so much , so I hope in the long run either in the public service or in the academic world .
L@@ O@@ L L@@ O@@ L L@@ O@@ L is really late !
Ex@@ ac@@ tly , when I obtained my qualification in 2011 there was already a three-@@ year delay .
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed gradu@@ ates ?
To get rid of the b@@ is@@ go@@ t networks as art / letters / theat@@ re / media / philosophy / political philosophy , that is , the so-called unemployed diplomas .
I have one of those diplomas and I have finished production .
It turned out that the important thing was not the diplom@@ a but , as the article says , a good professional career , starting with school and throughout the university .
Of course the original wage was lower , but we are rapidly rising because in the real world what matters is more than knowledge .
This discussion of artistic engineering engineers has been going on for years .
Scienti@@ sts cannot solve all the problems , it is more important to be able to rise in the morning , get to work and inter@@ act with people in order to achieve results .
L@@ it@@ tle , philosophy and art are b@@ is@@ sts ?
That is ridiculous .
I assume that you are talking about gender@@ -@@ study diplomas , or whatever the absent industry where you have gone .
Lat@@ er , philosophy , political science and art are real channels .
We need people who can explain the major issues to school pupils , who understand the importance of the bases of culture such as literature , art , etc .
Would it not be better for a real territorial policy to dis@@ solve Paris and boost the rest of France ?
Personally , I find it hard to see people from the bottom up of the E@@ sk@@ e and the V@@ al-@@ O@@ d@@ d make 8@@ 0@@ km aller@@ -@@ return every day in bic@@ ycle to come to Paris .
In@@ tra@@ m@@ os and small bel@@ ts already have many other means of public transport which are more practical in practice ( me@@ tr@@ o , bus , tra@@ ms ) .
There are a number of safe and closed par@@ ks , as already exists in the cities of northern Europe , Di@@ j@@ on or L@@ y@@ on , which are in the pipeline , and will be inst@@ alled in the ve@@ ter@@ a .
That is a good idea .
On the surface , space is can@@ ni@@ fied by the 2@@ R@@ M .
Incidentally , it is hoped that the City of Paris works with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark .
That is all very well .
Well , there has been no room for U@@ N S@@ U@@ L to c@@ ling bic@@ yc@@ les .
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Ber@@ tr@@ d Del@@ ano@@ a …
Well , that is not at all .
When we talk with pedestri@@ ans and other public transport users why they do not ped@@ dle it , I think that the main reasons are : 1 / it is hy@@ per@@ dangerous with all these b@@ ars , these lorries , those sp@@ il@@ lo@@ vers who are running fast and are full of pollution in my mind , and the road traffic system must be reduced by systematically ver@@ b@@ ati@@ m .
The cycl@@ able paths are apar@@ theid , we need to live together , but re@@ balance the occupation of urban space .
Nothing about bic@@ ycle in the Great Paris ?
Not a word about the place of bic@@ ycle in public transport ?
E@@ EL@@ V is right .
The target of 15 % of the bic@@ ycle is ridiculous .

Before the rac@@ ke@@ te@@ ering begins , it would be better to find who hide behind this massacre .

A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the EC@@ HR , but I did not hear that a complaint was indeed lod@@ ged .
Moreover , they should be lod@@ ged in Germany or Ukraine first .
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the investigation report on the accident and the resulting criminal investigation .
O@@ h , but Libya did not blow P@@ an A@@ m 103 either .
Mal@@ ay@@ sia Air@@ lines is wrong , the fault lies with the airspace security authority , in this case the Ukrainian Government .
Was the accident predictable ?
Other aircraft had previously been slaughtered , Ukraine was launching air attacks on the rebels , and any aircraft could of course be considered as a possible and immediate threat .
Has the Ukrainian Government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay for the over@@ flight rights of the territory ?
Where all the pro-@@ Ki@@ ev tro@@ ams are defending their u@@ sur@@ p@@ ers / ultra-@@ nation@@ alists in Western Ukraine , and who want to demonstrate in bulk that Putin has shot the M@@ H@@ 17 flight .
As far as I know , there is already a complaint against the government in Ki@@ ev because they are responsible for what is happening in their sk@@ ies .
The precedent : a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the provision of arms by the CIA to the rebel forces of Con@@ tra@@ its in Nicaragua did not mean that the US is responsible for their actions .
There is no chance that Russia will leave it to the IC@@ J .
It is fun@@ ny to think that Ab@@ bot@@ t means to Putin that Austr@@ ali@@ ans have been murdered by Russian rebels .
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations .
So far , the investig@@ ators have said nothing of this .
To call Ric@@ ardo and to be such a ro@@ o@@ y@@ ant in ec@@ o , it is dist@@ ressing !

A single ch@@ or@@ o@@ tian question : is today &apos;s poor poorer than the poor of yesterday ?
I cannot help notic@@ ing that those who are most critical of Pi@@ ke@@ tty &apos;s book have not read it !
It is easy to read , I took a few days .
It shows the statistical development of res@@ cu@@ -@@ production , res@@ hu@@ -@@ capital , unequal concentration , inequality of income from work , capital ownership , and the legacy of capital in the lo@@ g .
It shows that today &apos;s concentration of capital comes from the beginning of the 20 th before 19@@ 14 , it shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital from 19@@ 14 to 1945 and then how concentration resumed after ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : you d@@ ance not to what .
I ask you how long it has taken you to read this pa@@ ke , knowing that individual concentration capacity has some limits .
Secondly , the question is not whether it is easy to read .
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is right or not .
If it is right , we can debate it without having read the book , which is what is most important to argue in favour of it .
No , it is easy to read ... it is easy to read ...
Ber@@ na@@ ju@@ z@@ an : how long have you got to read it ?
Does the central thesis of his ma@@ fia summar@@ ised by the press are false ?
I have not read and read it .
I therefore rely on the summary of its central thesis and that is what seems to me to be pure smoke .
The gap between rich and poor is subsidiary .
Has mankind not enriched itself in general ?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today .
Mal@@ ala Y@@ ou@@ sa@@ z@@ ai is an impressive figure and deserves the price without doubt .
But remember that it is only 17 years .
An age to which most people are just starting to find their place in the world .
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the gir@@ l and will find his way to a happy life .
The problem is not the price , but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old ad@@ age that perverse col@@ our@@ ings are the embo@@ di@@ ment of evil .
My best wishes in Mal@@ ala , but she must realise that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in Britain &apos;s popular neigh@@ bor@@ hoods !
Some@@ body thought he was a little strange .
She than@@ ked his father for giving him a great deal of freedom , but he mentioned that if she is not where she is now , she would have been married to 14 years .
Is Mal@@ ala itself not part of these &apos; perverse col@@ our@@ ings &apos; ?
You should not have any &apos; time time &apos; on this site .
You are , yourself , a horri@@ ble perverse .
That is absolutely appalling .
No , his father was not going to mar@@ ry her at 14 years .
It was 15 years old when it was drawn .
His father runs a school where girls are school and he is in favour of equal rights for women .
It is , and has always been , to receive higher education and to have the right to decide on its own marriage .
However , it is someone who is unusual in Pakistan , as he believes that women are equal to men .
What she said is that an average Pakistani gir@@ l often has to mar@@ ry at 14 years , without having a say .
It is a response that she has not made sufficiently eloqu@@ ent for you .
It may seem contradictory , but perhaps it would say that if his father had not given him freedom , she would have been married to 14 years .
Rather than disappointed with this season 4 , and especially J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , which apparently has a little difficulty in finding his com@@ ic character of Mar@@ len@@ e Di@@ e@@ ri@@ ch .
I have just looked at the two seas@@ ons that are quite different , but I have to admit that this is one of the best series of horror , one of the most successful .
A first fascin@@ ating first episo@@ de .
The achievement is close to perfec@@ tion , and J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ’ s s@@ lot s@@ inging the an@@ ach@@ ron@@ istic Life on Bo@@ y .
I have not yet looked at this new season ( which will be the last for me , without beef Lange ) .
In the case of American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r St@@ tor@@ y , I would prefer to have seen 13 episo@@ des running over 3-@@ 4 months .
One thing , however , is that , apart from the extraordinary J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , it is above all the risks of scenes and mountains that are being put to me .
There has been an a@@ val@@ an@@ che of original plans in A@@ H@@ S , which makes it difficult for today ’ s production to be used .
C@@ a escap@@ es me a little from seeing you throw the spot@@ light in advance for the next seas@@ ons without even waiting for the quality of quality .
J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but , as you say so well , there are many other things .
No , it is simply that for me J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange ( and above all his path and the way in which it uses it ) really is U@@ N of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities .
I look very much for her .
In my view , the series is in writing , it wants to do too much at the same time .
The season 3 was slightly below , in 2 it was too dis@@ per@@ sed despite some excellent episo@@ des .
I see them not to make 10 seas@@ ons from American H@@ or@@ ro@@ r St@@ tor@@ y or to end like 24 hours long .
But everyone does what they want !
It is by what I say ‘ I will not look after later ’ that everyone is obliged to do so !
I simply share my point of view , nothing less .
The loss of J@@ es@@ si@@ ca Lange , J@@ E thinks it will be fatal .
But then that is just my opinion .
Let us talk about less tax increases , please , let us instead go into state spending .
No , let us increase spending .
Those who wanted to cut spending failed .
Deb@@ ating po@@ le@@ m@@ ics about relatively small expenditure items , such as development aid
The problem is that this is less than the margin for error in government spending in the UK .
The truth is that we are all talking about nu@@ ances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to want , and throughout this time there are some in each side who pretend that these nu@@ ances are far greater and substantial than they are - and voters see their game and find them in bad faith .
L@@ ess than 1 % of the expenditure is spent .
“ debt ” is assets held mainly by financial institutions in that country .
The &apos; debt &apos; is nothing to worry about .
I would not see any problem with the government approaching a third of my income ( before even talking about consumer taxes ) if I thought it would use it .
But that is not the case , and many taxpayers have the same feeling .
It is said that Ni@@ gel Far@@ age has not been entirely honest about how to cut taxes but good , if you add our net contribution to the EU , development aid , Hi@@ gh St@@ ed 2 , subsidies for almost useless wind tur@@ b@@ ines and nuclear power stations which cost twice what they should be .
Your first GBP 10 000 are not tax@@ able .
This means that someone who earn £ 35 000 per year will pay around £ 5 000 ( a seventh of their salary ) , someone with £ 50 000 would pay around £ 10@@ ,000 ( a fifth ) , etc . , and someone with £ 200 000 pays about £ 70 000 ( just over a third ) .
And social security contributions ?
The more social contributions , the more local taxes , the more par@@ king costs and the car stic@@ ker , and it is before VAT .
Almost 30 % of my money is deduc@@ ted from the source before local taxes and car stic@@ ker .
I am paid decent , but not extra@@ v@@ ag@@ ant .
Not because this is a problem , of course , I am happy to pay my taxes .
But let us not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky , or that it is not important to know where billions of p@@ ounds of taxes are spent .
How can an unemployed person seeking work at the door prove this ?
Even if 20 % of the unemployed would not seek , that means 80 % .
Because I am unemployed , I have more interest in what others seek or not .
Whether a potential recru@@ itor receives 10 or 20 C@@ V , this gives my chances .
Indeed , I have not had any news from Po@@ le Employment for months , so that the agents are more engaged in monitoring operations than actually getting job announ@@ cements back on their feet ?
I see no interest .
Because it is not up to the state to provide work .
If Po@@ le Employment does not provide enough posts , then we must do without Po@@ le Employment .
What is a sensitive issue ?
We all have rights and duties , in this case it is ensured that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights .
Just as an contro@@ ller asks for their transport title to users of a means of transport , a head of service or the employees of their work , etc .
No one cri@@ es out in these cases ?
It is indeed worth remembering that the unemployed have rights : the only two times that I was in Po@@ le Employment , my rights to the ARE had been badly established , and on one of the dossiers , cut by 40 % .
It takes time !
I am not an expert .
Tr@@ ust and control are taking precedence at the present time , when the rule of law is close to the point of being , in fact , an insurance company .
I would add that the subject of compensation should only apply to employees , and it is they who pay the col@@ leg@@ es .
Un@@ employed policies and French policies grant rights that they do not actually have !
That is not normal .
I would add that worthy unemployment insurance is part of the recovery of work .
More than waiting for kill@@ ers in Arab@@ ic ...
In fact , we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop I@@ sis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone .
The situation would then resemb@@ le the spread of the black pl@@ ague in 13@@ 48 / 9 in connection with war and population movements at the time .
The S@@ aud@@ is had the spirit of banning H@@ ad@@ j in M@@ ec@@ ca this year with Muslim pil@@ gri@@ ms from the three countries affected .
El P@@ is reports that 7 400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent journeys .
In fact there was a pil@@ gri@@ m@@ in from Bosnia who contr@@ acted M@@ ec@@ ca in the H@@ ad@@ j in the 1980s , probably contaminated by a pil@@ gri@@ m from Somalia , where the disease still exists .
I hope the rest of the world will have the same mind .
Is it not a matter of heart to propose preventing sick people from E@@ bol@@ a from flying a plane for Europe ?
I thought it was common sense , but apparently those &apos; who know &apos; decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people ...
These West African countries where E@@ bol@@ a is out of control should be quar@@ ant@@ ine .
No one is getting out of it .
Only health staff can enter .
21 days after treating patients before they were able to leave .
If they contr@@ act the E@@ bol@@ a virus while they are there , they will stay there until they are cu@@ red .
These are not d@@ rac@@ onian measures .
Last week alone , people were contaminated after contacts with people in West Africa , although they took “ all necessary precautions . ”
This disease can be stopped .
It is spreading mainly by airlines .
Let us ask them to fly to these countries .
Furthermore , customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of E@@ bol@@ a , so that they can be put to quar@@ ant@@ ine immediately .
Whether it succe@@ eds in conve@@ ying the message of the first and religious ( including religious ) group , and he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize .
I doubt that he is capable of erec@@ ting the image of God with the full cor@@ tex of the planet in operation .
There is still a long way to go .
It is only 20 years since information appeared as a given premium for humanity , while religion , which came from the ic@@ is@@ et , has been leading our actions since Luc@@ y perhaps .
What is the point of becoming yet another Pro@@ te@@ stant church ?
For those who have not noticed , Ca@@ thol@@ ic@@ ism is largely minority in France today , and no one is forced to join .
Those who criticise would not have their feet in the Church anyway , but only the small number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France .
What is the next step , the notion of sin , too &apos; an@@ tics &apos; ?
S@@ or@@ ry : S@@ or@@ ry does not have a vision limited to France .
And , in the world , it can be that way .
No@@ -@@ Mar@@ ine E , to be honest ( as usual ) , respect for others as you envisage in the char@@ t .
H@@ ill@@ er a century before told him : &apos; Do not do others what you do not want to be done , that is the whole Tor@@ ah and the rest is just comment : go and study ! &apos;
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity , but introduces the lam@@ b .
Are you &apos; advancing justice , peace , fr@@ ater@@ nity &apos; but without God ?
It is a return to communism .
The next step is to remove the inc@@ ar@@ nation and resur@@ rec@@ tion .
Je@@ sus will remain the her@@ o that has sha@@ ken moral laws by re@@ defining respect for others .
Christians will then be prepared to play their part in the ethical debates in our societies and bring forward justice , peace and fr@@ ater@@ nity .
This is not a very Catholic matter ?
I believe that the small number of Pro@@ te@@ stan@@ ts in France is mainly due to the fact that their anc@@ estors were ex@@ termin@@ ated and then converted from force and forced to immigration a few centuries ago .
I hesitate too much between buying this , the new A@@ bond game , or W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 .
And the new E@@ li@@ te game is soon to come .
It is not going to be sold .
Personally , I would choose S@@ M .
I like W@@ ast@@ el@@ and 2 ( I even took part in his campaign for the release of funds ) , but I do not think it is 30 p@@ ounds .
If it is the P@@ C , which is of interest to you , Green M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is now selling S@@ M to 30 p@@ ounds and is also proposing a good 20 % reduction .
Green M@@ an G@@ am@@ ing is now selling S@@ M at 30 p@@ ounds and is also proposing a good 20 % reduction .
I am going to look at it .
Of course , it is not the job of the job .
The joy of the computer department is blocking all sites .
Bon@@ o , is it 30 p@@ ounds and 20 % reduction , or does the 30 p@@ ounds include the 20 % reduction ?
Let us be careful , however : the P@@ C version is only for D@@ X@@ 11 .
It took me by surprise , I bought it , but it cannot play .
In addition , I bought it on Ste@@ am , so no reimbursement is .
It is time to buy a new video card .
It is a Brazilian site , but you get an identi@@ fying Ste@@ am , I believe .
I have not used it myself .

Thus , was France in 19@@ 40 a &apos; pu@@ ri@@ ad ter@@ rain &apos; ?
So there is a great deal to be gained from this Nobel Prize .
France needs 40 , the &apos; bizarre defeat &apos; ?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize for literature one won@@ ders whether or not P@@ rou@@ st or Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky would now have it .
The Nobel lau@@ reate is not even an event , it is not even an attempt to read the pri@@ zed authors .
Brazili@@ ans , Chinese or Austr@@ ali@@ ans will read Mo@@ di@@ ano , who is already hard to read in French and describes such a limited and equal uni@@ verse ?
I hope that the other No@@ els are more credible , but frankly I doubt them .
Mo@@ di@@ ano , Lev@@ y , Mus@@ ed@@ o , has only a distant report with literature .
Have you read it at least ?
Or another Nobel Prize ?
It would be better to judge .
As for the Chinese , Brazili@@ ans and others , do not worry for them .
foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture , they are very sensitive .
They will appreciate Mr President .
It is a good thing , if they do not know it already !
For your part , they continue to attend L@@ é@@ dy and Mus@@ vo .
I share your view .
Mar@@ c Lev@@ y and Gu@@ il@@ lau@@ me Mus@@ us@@ o retain all their opportunities .
So let us see who got the Nobel Prize for literature : H@@ .

That is Wednesday !
I had a few days of rest .
It was co@@ ol .
Last weekend I went to the celebration of the beer and cement of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ing@@ ham .
It was a matter of course .
I managed to disgu@@ ise 19 different beer , W@@ ob@@ b@@ ny Weber being one of my fav@@ our@@ ite .
I was pleas@@ antly surprised by the mix@@ ture of people there , and not only with the fana@@ tical fana@@ tics .
Re@@ placing on Sunday was really hard .
On Monday evening we went to the grand@@ father of a po@@ t to play the n@@ in@@ k b@@ are .
With a real opportunity to start , I have been able to start with a number of decent re@@ vel@@ ations .
I hope that if I arrive 95 years I will be as lively as he is .
Last night I went to a chi@@ p bar in Far@@ r@@ ing@@ don .
One of my drinks has arrived with a ch@@ al@@ k in the head .
I ad@@ mire Mr President of the Commission , Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen .
Lis@@ ten to Bou@@ d@@ ha and you will understand how wrong you are , dear Christian .
Having said that , without wishing to contradict you , I believe that you are moving away from the subject .
This famous whole ban on d@@ ji@@ ha@@ d@@ is from mo@@ squ@@ es .
It immediately points out arms trafficking .
Either you have a great deal of open eyes like Med@@ de@@ b and Tai@@ a or Bou@@ bas@@ ker or you have a closed eyes .
We have to choose .
It is not with closed eyes that one gets light .
Ex@@ c@@ use me , dear Christian , but once again you are making a monu@@ mental counter-@@ sense : all the authorities , organisations or associations , whether Muslim or not , having formally condemned the I@@ I and its crimes , the French , Muslims or not , have nothing to add to these unanimous sentences .
No one says a word .
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims , Arabs or Africans .
Not as French .
Unfortunately , K@@ en@@ ch h Mer@@ hel , there is doubt for everyone .
As I said a thousand times , there are doubts about the approval by French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza , but it would be fool@@ ish and fool@@ ish to accuse them of them and demand that they publicly demonstrate to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it .
This principle is , in my view , the neg@@ ation of the Republic and can only help to un@@ lock French society .
There is no doubt , so to speak .
Who does not say word , but what ?
K@@ e@@ ep with I@@ I or the conviction of I@@ I .
The silence is well practic@@ ed , and it is the main weapon of those who want to wi@@ pe out the go@@ g and the k@@ nees .
Your position is intellec@@ tually honest but pragmatic .
Ale@@ x Sal@@ mon@@ d predicted that Scotland could , in the elections , &apos; reven@@ ge &apos; the parties represented at West@@ min@@ ster because there was a huge gap between their proposals for decentralisation and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence .
Cameron must be sac@@ red from losing all these seats at West@@ min@@ ster ...
Cameron must be lau@@ g@@ hable .
Is that what these threats are ?
The Conservatives are completely f@@ ond of Scotland because they have no seat there .
They can do what they want with full electoral impunity .
I do not believe that even Cameron is fool@@ ish enough to believe that the Lab@@ or losing seats at West@@ min@@ ster for the benefit of the S@@ N@@ P is a good thing in the long term for him and the Conservatives .
Who will pay a te@@ ars for the Labour Party .
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the S@@ N@@ P and UK@@ IP , which will cut their heads in the north .
E@@ d M@@ ili@@ band joined the “ P@@ RO@@ ME@@ SE ” thinking that he was res@@ cu@@ ing his party , but without realising that he signed the death sentence of his Scottish Members .
No wonder some Labour MEPs are asking their leaders to account .
If the S@@ N@@ P gains 20-@@ 25 seats and there is no majority in parliament , even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives , they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition , and they can force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralisation .
I believe this is important .
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-@@ elected in England one day .
C@@ losing the 8 % p@@ um@@ ps at the expense of 85 % is not an electoral super-@@ strategy .
Moreover , once Scottish MEPs are no longer able to vote on British issues , Conservatives will win all votes .
O@@ h , I believe it is .
Cameron may not have much to lose , but Mi@@ ili@@ and .
Mag@@ ace did it with the Ul@@ ster Uni@@ onists and did so well .
Yet he is still in a position to be prime minister in 2015 and has won the Labour Party .
So , basically , these bo@@ xes will be virtually behind each read@@ er to look beyond their shoulders and see what he read , how he reads , and to the end .
It is “ the life of others ” in East Germany or the K@@ G@@ B applied to the F@@ R@@ I@@ C .
Still the same fasc@@ ination for monitoring techniques .
Ultimately , this will at least have a ster@@ ili@@ zing effect .
I expect the next ticket : Ama@@ z@@ on manufactured V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E according to V@@ O@@ T@@ R@@ E prof@@ iles and this automatically thanks to an al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ m of its secrecy !
It is like the world .
It is quite encouraging to stimulate this .
Thank you for the article .
As under this system , the management of D@@ R@@ M@@ s is not imp@@ aired , but I am reading pir@@ ated files , public books , and bought from a few publ@@ ish@@ ers who have the intelligence to offer files without mo@@ ck@@ ers .

I am amazed at the widespread ab@@ dic@@ ation of users against the widespread appropriation of their privacy .
In your public boo@@ k@@ shop , you will systematically notice that everyone is giving their fi@@ de@@ lity card ( fo@@ e no ) .
There are also demanding ma@@ ster@@ pieces whose opening and completion rates are probably der@@ is@@ ory .
For example , James Jo@@ e ’ s Fin@@ ne@@ g@@ ans Wa@@ e .
Fourth Thomas : in the Bi@@ g D@@ ata era , the data do not really need to be personal .
We must be careful not to put all literature in the same b@@ reath .
The collection of an@@ onymous data when there is a profile ...
The harvest is not an@@ onymous .
It is the data published by K@@ ob@@ o , not to identify read@@ ers or authors .
But K@@ ob@@ o has all this information .
There have been so many exaggerated , er@@ ron@@ eous and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be governed by a mother class full of ac@@ id sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ga@@ ins .
This is even worse than that if you take into account Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism .
It is interesting that some of Er@@ dog@@ an ’ s supporters believe that Islamist is such an insult that they do away with your comment , but not mine .
Of course , it is true that Turkey does not want to sho@@ ot itself in the foot unless it gains anything .
If it attacks I@@ SIS , I@@ SIS will be able to go down , then it is actually going to get off the ground .
A pension diplom@@ at written on his blo@@ g : “ The A@@ PA reports that Iran warned the US that it would be wrong to seek to top@@ ple Syrian President Bas@@ ha@@ r al-@@ Assad , because that would jeopardise Israel ’ s security .
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning warning , or whether it simply advis@@ es caution .
This second option is more likely and , in any case , what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria , Israel and the region ’ s security .
The reading of Indi@@ an P@@ un@@ ch@@ ine is to be strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the fo@@ d@@ der of the traditional media , and the short article that you link is important and should be read with the previous realistic and realistic comments from Iran to propose from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980 .
Who are these “ moder@@ ates ” who are seriously fighting the secular Assad and the per@@ ver@@ ts of I@@ SIS ?
The pipeline policy is pushing the world into the ab@@ ys@@ s and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “ moder@@ ates ” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War .
&apos;@@ It is even worse than that if you take into account Er@@ dog@@ an &apos;s religious fundamentalism &apos; , are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East ?
I have one in mind .
There should be a N@@ u@@ rem@@ berg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks .
What is needed ?
Do you realise that neither the criminals nor the victims have any chance of being still alive ?
A little late for that , my po@@ t ...
Are criminals not just old now , 120 years old ?
A little late for that ?
Particularly with regard to the C@@ U@@ P tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate , which planned and led the genocide , T@@ al@@ a@@ at and D@@ j@@ em@@ al killed just after World War II by reven@@ ge by the Armen@@ ians , and En@@ ver killed by the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks in Central Asia at roughly the same time , when he was dre@@ aming of creating a Turkish empire .

It is a shame to appoint them as future psychological dis@@ equilibrium .

What is important here is that this practice should be regulated so that the &apos; commerci@@ alisation &apos; of the body is limited .

A very true article , which is very true .
Since Tony Par@@ son &apos;s film , there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of northern England &apos;s culture .
No wonder Paul M@@ son has gras@@ ped the social and political context well , he understands things well .

Business is becoming increasingly pois@@ on@@ ous .
Palestinians have no partner for peace .
Unfortunately , Netanyahu never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace .
Four J@@ on@@ a@@ than : Netanyahu is not seeking peace because he wants to continue to colon@@ ize ( indeed , it was also the case of R@@ ab@@ in ) .
It is clear that R@@ ab@@ in , Netanyahu , and their voters all preferred the settlement settlement to peace .
He with@@ drew his clo@@ thes , the post on the ro@@ ck and entered water .
An Israeli had stolen them .
The Israeli representative is angry and voting : &apos; What are you talking about ?
Israelis were not even there ! &apos;
The Palestinian representative ( UN ) s@@ mile and added : and now that things are clearly established .
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bi@@ polar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower the guard ...
It is obvious to the anti-@@ Israelis that this is not the intention ...
An@@ tar@@ ion@@ ist : I have answered you , I am transl@@ ating : the global geopolitical report ...
And that has always been the case since politics is globalised ...
It must be avoided , and it must be avoided ...
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , for the creation of the Palestinian state , it is certain .
For the creation of Israel you do not answer .
What balance of power did Israel create ?
An@@ tar@@ ion@@ ist : the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force of strength .
You doubt that !
Moreover , it is not just about Rus@@ sell Br@@ and , but the Guar@@ dian ’ s journalists have the air to find it difficult to go beyond anything that he does not have to say .
Many of what he says are just p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ists written no others .
This proves that you do not understand what Ru@@ sell Br@@ and says , or what No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky says .
It is just a continuation of personal attacks and ins@@ in@@ uations ( my 13@@ -@@ year-old daughter likes it well , which means that it is a question of im@@ maturity ) .
A truly vicious burden , with just a suspicion of awareness that Rus@@ sell Br@@ and says some tru@@ ths , perhaps tru@@ ths that we prefer not to think about .
Please act , this feeling will become increasingly widespread !
I can understand why B@@ and horri@@ ble some are : sometimes he speaks pre@@ mat@@ u@@ rely , and after all the absur@@ dities of the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id , he does indeed seem to be an initial populist , but the whole story of not voting has been completely mis@@ interpreted in my view .
The general consensus seems to be that it is just saying to people that they do not vote and instead sit down and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview with Pa@@ x@@ man and other articles / vide@@ os that he has issued , he says that voting once every five years for Labour or the Conservatives ( or the Li@@ b D@@ s I assume ) and limiting the democratic commitment to that is completely unnecessary , and that the parties should be much more politically active at the local level ,
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution ( because I believe that being politically active by presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting , given that politicians are a sla@@ p in the face if they are really in danger of losing elections ) , but it is up to see all these con@@ des@@ cen@@ ding answers that say that the im@@ pu@@ gn@@ le that makes Je@@ sus will not take the trouble to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it really is distorted .
His solution is extremely questionable , and it would be good if people were to debate what he actually says rather than simply label it as irresponsible and put aside the concerns of him and a large number of people who are left behind .
Yes , thank you , thank you .
The vote on the vote has been completely distorted .
I am deeply distur@@ bed by the in@@ usefulness of sli@@ pping a bul@@ l@@ tin every five years , because my vote really does not count for anything .
I want more referendums , electronic voting , direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters .
In addition , I dispute the idea that the words of Ru@@ se@@ ell Br@@ and are not the si@@ ghts ( written by others ) .
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas , even though they are heavily influenced by the kind of anti-@@ culture thin@@ kers and anti-@@ culture aca@@ demics that Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne would like to bring together under the label &apos; p@@ se@@ u@@ do@@ -@@ ch@@ om@@ sk@@ y@@ ist &apos; .
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Su@@ z@@ an@@ ne .
Perhaps that is what the Guar@@ dian could do , that Su@@ z@@ ann@@ e is doing the same as Pol@@ ly To@@ y@@ n@@ be@@ e and interview Rus@@ sell on a v@@ int@@ age , even with the head@@ line ho@@ sts added to the mon@@ ster !
Like Ma@@ x K@@ e@@ is@@ er , who at the beginning attacked Rus@@ s@@ sel but ended up becoming one of his f@@ ans and inviting him in his program , it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come .
It pun@@ ishes in a political speech that has existed for generations , but has been margin@@ alized by the traditional media – including the Guar@@ dian – for generations .
This “ fron@@ t@@ line ” reveals , in my view , that intellectual debate has long been held in the history of history in history , where professional histor@@ ians have become a minority , and the exchange of specialists has become poorer for the benefit of con@@ den@@ sed science P@@ o .
For my part , I had seen the intellectual attitude of Pi@@ er@@ re Bour@@ di@@ u as well as that of Michel F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult , a need to attack a person , a scapego@@ at .
They both develop very rational arguments , but this ration@@ ality is based on the scapego@@ ats that are the key to their thinking .
Instead , I believe that the state was indispensable as a cul@@ pri@@ t .
This is a very ar@@ cha@@ ic thought , with thought being sacrificed , which is also magic thinking .
The problem from the report to the other is resolved by eliminating it .
There is an an@@ arch@@ ic , neo-@@ li@@ b , / / liber@@ tarian sl@@ ope ( the second is a tougher desire to eradicate the state , the first knowing to seek government relief for its markets ) in F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult ’ s sense of state .
The old dream of the basis that self-@@ organis@@ s itself .
His thinking is built on the guilt of the state : without this guilt it does not stand up .
Anyone who claims guilty , says elimination , murder and sacrifice .
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here .
There is no support , moreover , for the fact that there is no support for it .
The totalitarian left is re@@ minis@@ cent of the good old times , that of its God , Stalin , the small father of the people .
O@@ ul@@ ala , you may have read a ch@@ un@@ k too quickly if you took the F@@ ou@@ ca@@ ult texts on the Iranian revolution for a K@@ home@@ ini apo@@ logy .
Today , even Pi@@ er@@ re Man@@ e would no longer be able to attack Michel in this way ...
G@@ ot@@ chet is a serious reflection of the contemporary person and the collective , the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies .
Whether or not we agree with him is an original and respec@@ table thin@@ ker .
To look at this boo@@ th or@@ che@@ str@@ ated by human scienti@@ st researchers who do not bear the br@@ unt of al@@ legi@@ ance to their man@@ tr@@ a is quite lau@@ g@@ hable .
The nar@@ co@@ is@@ me and the author@@ itarianism of these people are un@@ restra@@ ined .
One important point to add seems to me to be the position of these &apos; rebels &apos; , which is only intellectual and theoretical .
The treatment of Chinese and other “ y@@ el@@ low ” in Russia is absolutely incredible .
You did not have the pleasure of hearing our Austr@@ ali@@ an friends on this subject .
And where was Russia , that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion ?
I do not remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time .
In London , and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian .
In Russia here - in the 1990s , last time , in a market .
The Chinese think of wh@@ ites like wh@@ ites !
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Gu@@ ang@@ z@@ h@@ ou a long time ago , in the middle of the 20th century , and I still hear some of them speak viol@@ ently anti-@@ B@@ lan@@ ks .
My father is not happy that his old daughter is like a white .
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and , above all , in recent years : they are increasingly rich , prosperity is spreading outside the large cities , and thanks to that prosperity people travel abroad and see how the others live .
From what I have been told , the Russians are mainly prejudices against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia , who work in professions and in areas where they are very fortunate to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence .
Although I have lived on the shores of the I@@ en@@ is@@ ai river in Si@@ ber@@ ia .
Unfortunately , I heard the views of the Austr@@ ali@@ ans on the Chinese and the Ab@@ ag@@ os .
It is truly bizarre that a foreign@@ er tells me that I do not support the Chinese , when I met two in my life ( of which one abroad ) , did not keep a bad memories , all people are equal and , in fact , those in London were very good for that reason .
Otherwise we do not remember who is to meet , all the people are worth remembering .
Do you know what is bizarre ?
Whether you and the other Russians here speak of the Chinese as a sort of single fasc@@ ination , as if they were an attractive part of a zo@@ o .
Yet you always come out with the B@@ lan@@ c .
How many Chinese men are with white men ?
No , because there is a great chance that the parents of these white groups will aggres@@ sively attack them .
No measure of the im@@ partiality of justice .
Yet it is the mother of all battles , and justice in France remains manipul@@ ated by highly left-wing groups like the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates ’ union …
It is a for@@ gi@@ veness : for@@ gi@@ veness , but the judicial circles are frankly a right .
When the judge of the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates only returns 25 % of the judges .
If a measure of its partiality can be made on the basis of the rela@@ xation of law enforcement in the courts , it comm@@ its two obstacles .
That is the political vision of the observer as the judge ’ s factual interpretation .
It then remains the necessary tool of the law to re@@ focus the assessment of fundamentals .
The measure of its in@@ consistency in all legal acts of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , including the public prosecutor , forces to distinguish between the error and the partiality of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates .
It would be pointless to claim that acts of justice are not divided between these three groups .
The claim and ignorance is not an objective analysis .
And if all this is not analysed , how then can justice improve in France ?
If it is only through statistics that implic@@ itly show that it is falling from the bottom up .
The previous preamble allows the following to be included in the third ratio .
The corruption of the judiciary .
This is a sensitive choice in proportion to the power of in@@ convenience that is given to the judicial institution capable of such he@@ res@@ y .
The area in question is that of the sp@@ il@@ lo@@ ver of he@@ irs committed up to the end of the procedure by means of sc@@ ams to the procedure , not by successive gener@@ olog@@ ists man@@ dated by no@@ tar@@ ies .
This profession gets EUR 150 million a year while benefiting from the illegal cover provided by the virtual legal impunity of the French no@@ te@@ te .
For understanding their mechanism , part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication .
Where it comes along with this moderate statistical improvement by the previous comment , it is that the judicial institution has produced , in many differences between gener@@ al@@ ist and he@@ irs reluctant to become bl@@ ur@@ red , a whole set of juris@@ prudence contrary to all the laws fav@@ orable to he@@ irs .
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria not a developed form of lies ?
Certainly , prices are completely prohibi@@ tive .
There is still material to help people with disabilities .
You can say that , but my bro@@ ther has one of these tri@@ bal tri@@ ps , built on size and weight , and that has really allowed him to benefit from the full air as ever a normal whe@@ el@@ chair , whe@@ el@@ chair and ty@@ res .

I am sure my s@@ ister would ad@@ mire all the ground , but it is simply too expensive .
The long-@@ distance whe@@ el@@ chair would be perfect for a handic@@ apped with a pen@@ sion@@ er pen@@ ny .
Here there are h@@ ills that would like them .
P@@ ric@@ es appear to be high , but there are really people who put such prices in a bic@@ ycle , so &apos; you see &apos; .
I think it is particularly useful .
Not all disabled people are poor , however .
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal .
It is only if they have become disabled that they have become disabled .
The tr@@ ick is that the whe@@ el@@ chair market is a nic@@ he , so they can afford to practise high prices for things that they know are necessary .
One cannot really say that the W@@ h@@ ill is minim@@ alist .
This is an example of excessive design .
Unfortunately , it is just a draft , it is not planned .
I am CO@@ NA@@ NT@@ T that the long-@@ distance whe@@ el@@ chair does not arrive on the market , because apparently there is no way to drive this fi@@ g fi@@ g .
Ne@@ arly 20 000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza , in intensive bombing of den@@ sely populated residential distric@@ ts .

Hal@@ f are children and young people under the age of 18 .

primary and populist action
In fact , we do not know too much what Mar@@ ine Le Pen thinks .
Where did you see that ?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
I am not sure that S@@ e really has &apos; refused &apos; to rescue the survi@@ v@@ ors .
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed secure about the exact strength of the enemy .
Robert M@@ as@@ sia in his book “ C@@ ast@@ le of Ste@@ el ” suggests that S@@ pe@@ e quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cu@@ i@@ gre@@ ed in the area .
The sea was turbul@@ ent at the beginning of the day ; I do not know whether this was still the case at the end of the battle .
Similarly , the fight ended after the sun@@ set , making any rescue operation more difficult .
Comp@@ are that with the next battle , that of the Fal@@ lands , where , on the photo@@ graph@@ s showing the survi@@ v@@ ors who are being res@@ cu@@ ed , we see a calm and up-to-date sea .
Moreover , the res@@ cu@@ ers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage .
H@@ um@@ m , that does not really correspond to what I remember to read on this battle , so I made a quick research into Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a :
“ There was some confusion among German ships about the fate of the two co@@ hab@@ ited cr@@ us@@ ers , who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped sho@@ oting , and a crow@@ d began .
The L@@ ei@@ p@@ zi@@ g lives on fire , but by coming closer to life it is a wrec@@ k .
The N@@ ü@@ r@@ n@@ berg , slower than other German ships , is joining the bel@@ ated battle and is living in Mon@@ mal@@ th , pon@@ dered and seriously damaged , but still on the move .
After pointing out his spot@@ light on the flag of the ship , the proposal to go to the ship was refused and he opened the fire , finally leaving the ship .
Without reliable information , von S@@ e considered that Go@@ o@@ d H@@ ope had to escape and stopped research at 10.@@ 15 .
Un@@ il@@ et reports of a British cu@@ ic@@ ycle in the vic@@ inity , he went to the north . &apos;
So , if it is true , the Germans , trying in the dar@@ k@@ ness before the ra@@ d@@ ar invention , did not know that a ship had sun@@ k , and therefore could not search for survi@@ v@@ ors .
They also believed that there was a larger co@@ i@@ gre@@ ed of the Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y in the area that could have seriously damaged them , so in the confusion they disgu@@ ised to take advantage of their advance .
They were far from their base , and S@@ pe@@ e was well aware that they should find a way through many Ro@@ yal Nav@@ y ships .
C@@ ra@@ do@@ k ’ s sacrifice had already caused them to harm them and put them at about half of their muni@@ tions , condemning them when they were finally caught .
There are a number of votes to the U@@ M@@ P to ask that it be enshrined in the law that a definitively condemned elected person is permanently un@@ eligible .
That is a courageous position , which would also affect left-wing elected representatives .
It is a jo@@ ke , however , that it is a jo@@ ke .

When is the ban on trade unions in sectors already protected ?
How long will we tolerate this distortion of equality between citizens ?
En@@ coura@@ ged by politicians , whose vision of society is limited to these sectors , always quick to am@@ pli@@ fy the very people who will benefit from their in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ability to hinder the actions of real policies , which are really trying to get things moving , not the fine words whose im@@ mobility is commensurate with their complac@@ ency .

It supports the existence of politici@@ zed trade unions whose members make the huge power they hold at the service of its party .
It would not defend the same the@@ ories if right-wing , or even right-wing , trade unions were to be targeted by individuals on their side and led to a judicial and media war .
Your statements are completely free of charge .
If , at present , the right de@@ fies the legal situation , it is simply that it has committed the facts .
We do not have an example of left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice , but all those who have been subjected to his attention have not received a favourable treatment .
On the other hand , it has to be said that the union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates is not the only union of mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates and a minority .
That a minister strongly supports trade unions shows how useful they can be .
The trade union that you mention may be a minority one among the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates , but it is not a secret .
We are now wondering whether the &apos; mission &apos; of some judges is not more s@@ ali@@ ent than educ@@ ating .
You should be satisfied , but the S@@ M is a minority .
What are you complaining about ?
No@@ -@@ one : you forget that the mag@@ is@@ tr@@ ates are not officials like the others : they are the only ones who have the power to charge and to inc@@ ar@@ c@@ ate the all-@@ person .

The end of a career
In fact , it is more likely to lead to a career than the typical ro@@ ck journey , even if in your dreams you think that all the ste@@ ers that smoke from grass in their father ’ s gar@@ age and wi@@ pe out three agreements on a primary school level will surely become st@@ ars .
And worse than ridiculous : it creates a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the people studied – distance from racism , because sac@@ red eth@@ no@@ log@@ ists present these distant people as infin@@ itely super@@ sti@@ tious and ta@@ m@@ pered with rit@@ ual bi@@ go@@ try .
Unless you interpret im@@ prud@@ ently in the opposite direction .
Either , but rather than saying that the fl@@ ash@@ point is un@@ ho@@ ly , is it not better to admit that our Mari@@ ann@@ e and our Mo@@ li@@ es are not too sac@@ red , too ?
Our way is as follows .
That is all very interesting .

I would like to thank you for that , thank you very much . Thank you .
The recent Pan@@ the@@ on@@ ization of illu@@ stra@@ tive figures in the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sac@@ red still lives .

Any other discipline would throw out un@@ scientific interpretations that per@@ me@@ ate the life of a man@@ dar@@ in , rarely less .
When is a criticism compared with discipl@@ ines to lau@@ gh a little ?
Because what applies to ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology also applies to interpretations of other discipl@@ ines .
This would provide a do@@ se of sal@@ u@@ tary mode@@ sty .
Your contempt for ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists is completely unjustified !
It is thanks to them that trea@@ sures , valuable testi@@ monies to re@@ construct history , understand societies , and the example here of comparative ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology is exciting .
This method is not old , and the ar@@ cha@@ e@@ olog@@ ists used to be “ inst@@ inc@@ ts ” and their knowledge .

If you are so shocked , you are not obliged to take part , is this not the case ?

But it was necessary to end quickly before the typ@@ ho@@ on , which was known to arrive , but for which the F@@ O@@ M did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure ( TV law , pu@@ b , money … ) .
But , apart from that , they protect pil@@ ots .
I also agree with this view .
But there is also the fact that , if the very bri@@ ber@@ y F@@ O@@ M makes the S@@ C enter the S@@ C , it will allow Ni@@ co Ros@@ berg to have a chance to beat English that then led …
You leave my dear Dayton to the blo@@ g .
But that is not serious , but I have a little time to start all your debates .
No , it is not , just not .
There have been plenty of con@@ spir@@ acies in F@@ 1 , but never one that puts Commissioners at risk of death for a long history of the possibility of a pilot victory at the expense of another .
It is not the F@@ O@@ M that is getting out of the ba@@ g because it is the IF@@ A .
There is a great deal of N@@ ature .
In view of the am@@ ate@@ ur images , the absence of an image enables the I@@ IA to avoid troub@@ les@@ ome issues : how is it that the Commissioner is a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident ( see the full video after the accident ) ?
No , it is not because video is deemed too violent that the I@@ IA is blocking images of the accident , but because one of the Commissioners is clear about a green flag , a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the y@@ el@@ low flag .
Some comments show a dark ignorance of the F@@ 1 .
Yes , dear E@@ con@@ is , the race is no longer under the regime of y@@ el@@ low flags , the place of the accident , hence the green flag .
That is the usual procedure .
The post of comm@@ anders just down@@ stream of the accident ( depending on the case , it may be 10@@ me@@ tre as at 10@@ 0@@ me@@ ters after the accident ) is green to tell the pil@@ ots to resume a normal pace .
Sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism is selling the pu@@ b .
Before I thought that the media were part of the government &apos;s &quot; patri@@ otic &quot; propaganda offensive , but I am afraid that , ultimately , it is just for money .

In@@ fec@@ tions do exactly the same .
To make the bu@@ z@@ z with inf@@ ants whose care we really do not need is just to continue frigh@@ tening people so that they can continue to control them .
“ When the t@@ ab@@ lo@@ id on E@@ bol@@ a , we all appeal to fear , ” it should be ‘ der@@ ail@@ ing ’ , not “ ha@@ s@@ n ” .
In view of the medical reference , “ bat@@ tering ” is much better said in this context than ‘ der@@ ail@@ ing ’ .
I wonder whether all the people who are afraid that E@@ bol@@ a could start spreading by air realise that they now believe in evolution ?

They probably think that this is the end of the world and E@@ bol@@ a is just one of the signs of apo@@ c@@ aly@@ p@@ se .

It de@@ pres@@ ses me that the media talk about most things with that optimism .
The aim is once again to keep us sc@@ ared and anxious ( without getting into hy@@ ster@@ ia ) for the government to get us off the ground when it needs it .
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have a budgetary urgency in the absence of any crisis , a terrorist emergency without any attack , why not have an E@@ bol@@ a crisis without any proven case ?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself invented .
Is there not something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear ?

It is completely unnecessary .
As always when we talk about science .
Not only does the testi@@ monies serve no purpose : they cannot be used as scientific material .
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective appreciation of the facts .
It is not a scientific material . It is not a scientific material .
That is perhaps why we are abstaining from asking patients in psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry when we have reliable observations from the relatives .
My psy@@ chi@@ atric dossier mentions that my psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t explains that I have been educated tele@@ ph@@ ically by her mother .
This is therefore an objective symp@@ tom .
When I say that it is the head@@ scar@@ f , it is a subjec@@ tive testi@@ mony .
A@@ h , because the at@@ te@@ station of a fact ( including this testi@@ mony , which testi@@ fies to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments ) is pointless in a scientific approach ?
Where do you base the research , then ?

This system is not tenable and will end up in shame .
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution .
Since the economy appears to be in trouble , large companies have benefited enormously from their employees .
They have managed to convince their employees that they are fortunate enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages , while at the same time , and without hiding , they have given ever greater pay to the small elite at the top .
You are right , it is not tenable , but it will only change in that country when the workers really speak with one voice .
Instead of bur@@ ying and g@@ los@@ sing when someone else makes a strike , supporting them , showing a little solidarity and understanding that their strike is not just about their problems , it also shows your employer that people are not being punished with impunity .
Unless democracy is abandoned , in which case it is tenable .
I fully agree with that .
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst .
For example , China and India .
None of this can end .
It is because we are in democracy that it has been held .
Have you voted for the T@@ T@@ IP ?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( T@@ T@@ IP ) aims to increase the profits of the societies held by these people by by@@ passing national governments by secret courts .
It seems incredible , but that is exactly what the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and states ( IS@@ D@@ S ) has proposed in the agreement .
The Greens are against this project and try to alert people about the un@@ imagin@@ able damage that this agreement will have on our lives .
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about it in the media : Independent Gu@@ ard@@ an World Development , therefore , and you will understand what is being negotiated on your back .
Did Ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ill not say &apos; blood , swe@@ at and te@@ ars &apos; ?
This is an excellent fall@@ acy , when digital money has no reason to fall , let alone push the trees .
The next weak link will probably be the car market .
This gentle@@ man is right - in the X@@ V@@ III there were trade unions .
In the great French army , there is a dimension sacrificed .
Le@@ a@@ ve it ( at last , its officers , others , nobody knows nothing ) to believe that France ’ s e@@ ternal values will be stri@@ pped , and will fight .
And then , with the decline of the country , globalisation , Europe , the crisis of values , in short : the dis@@ solution of the idea of N@@ ation , having this small re@@ lic .
Even if it is becoming more and more un@@ comfortable .
You still lack the s@@ n@@ ap@@ shot of married men , c@@ ali@@ br@@ aries , married women , c@@ ali@@ br@@ aries , lost dogs , and I do not know what yet again .
If you do not write the French correctly , I am trade .
You are warned , that will be your fault .
For the defence of categor@@ ical interests , the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough , which has created a break of equality with other citizens .
We are asked not to lau@@ gh about the fear of risk by an official .
We can very well imagine a system that guarantees freedom of expression without trade unions , or without the right to strike as in Germany , in return for the protection they enjoy .
If we do not have a disaster , then we do not .
With the char@@ ts that are preparing , the government welcomes that .
What security are you talking about ?
Indeed , I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance ...
I@@ gn@@ or@@ ance for ignorance Sy@@ bil@@ la I referred to the military and other officials , since this is the subject here .
Sup@@ ply &apos; through its delegates &apos; in Article 8 of the preamble to the 19@@ 46 Constitution .
It will become &quot; 8 . &quot;
Every worker contributes to collective determination of working conditions and business management . &apos;
This is absolutely essential with the emergence of information power .
And yet you have opened up , presumably read , and then referred to an article specifically entitled &apos; The Great B@@ ak@@ e O@@ ff O@@ ff ? &apos;
Look , the section was there .
I thought we had to start talking .
In any case , it was the marriage of Je@@ off@@ rey that I looked at , and I can tell you that some have been well though@@ t-@@ out .
In the J@@ off@@ rey marriage episo@@ de , one of the best ( though dec@@ eptive ) moments was wine in television history .
So , from the l@@ um@@ ble to ...
G@@ ame of Th@@ ron@@ es !
I ad@@ mire G@@ B@@ B@@ O !
This is the second time in a row that , stran@@ gely enough , the emissions end with a victory for the least worst b@@ ak@@ er ; no one has made any kind of boom .
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally had an effect for them ?
In previous weeks , all these external people were kept out .
And there is also the idea of &apos; playing security , there is always next week &apos; which dis@@ appears the last week .
I like co@@ o@@ king , but I cannot imagine that .
I am grateful to those who do this and thus give us a super-@@ enter@@ tainment and drive us into new things .
P@@ B@@ B@@ O 2015 !
I agree that the last challenge last year , the marriage ca@@ ke , was absurd .
Prof@@ es@@ sional professionals usually have days to do so and they had to b@@ ail out one in 3-@@ 4 p.m.
The three challenges were really difficult to divide , and I do not know how they were able to choose a winner .
In Lu@@ is , the only real defec@@ t they could find was a rather dry basis ( though I agree with Hol@@ ly@@ wood that the green ice on Richard &apos;s m@@ ill did not en@@ vy , anyway , Richard . )
I have to say that several challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial due to the time available .
There is also the cancer that is taking place , with the wind wind .
Clearly , we are all successful at the moment .
There is a bad time for humanity , hopefully .
You confuse solar wind with ul@@ tra@@ vi@@ o@@ let ra@@ ys .
U@@ s are blocked mainly by the ozone layer , which is formed precisely by the impact of resid@@ ual solar wind par@@ ticles and U@@ V .
So , even if the mag@@ netic field weakened , there would not be enough solar wind to “ hun@@ t ” the ozone from the str@@ at@@ o@@ sphere .
There would be even more , and therefore less U@@ V and ‘ cancer ’ .
Fortunately , the ozone layer does not block U@@ V .
They have a lot of useful functions that you do not suspect .
If we confine ourselves to human beings , they have the interest of allowing us to have bone ( syn@@ thesis of vitam@@ in D ) , to heat us ( less than the in@@ shore ) , to mod@@ ul@@ ate our immune system and , apparently , to improve our morality .
The ozone layer is blocking carcinogenic U@@ V@@ s and leaving the U@@ V@@ A and most of the U@@ V@@ B .
You know that you are not obliged to be con@@ des@@ cen@@ ded and to see your interlocu@@ tor as a left when you make a comment ?
Especially for a minor prec@@ ision which was implied in the comment , which is intended to be ped@@ ago@@ gical .
Without saying that I am a accustomed to mel@@ ting , the U@@ V only makes AC@@ C@@ L@@ ER its development .
They do not have the P@@ O@@ V@@ O@@ D .
The proof is that all b@@ ron@@ z@@ és do not necessarily have mel@@ ancho@@ mes .
Either , when a tu@@ b@@ b tells you that we must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a can@@ e , it is better not to listen because the U@@ V is necessary for every human being .
The excess , however , is like everything : it k@@ ills .
But for other reasons .
U@@ . U@@ .
Can it be con@@ don@@ ed ?
And , more importantly , can it be done ?
or swit@@ ching to the mixed .
I believe that the majority of those concerned have established that everything can be done if sufficient force is applied and the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use it is intended for .
I believe that the army would need something more resili@@ ent and has thus not yet adopted the i@@ P@@ hon@@ e@@ 6 as a communication material on the front line .
For us , however , it is for us .
It remains a good choice .
The majority of those concerned have established that everything can be complied with if sufficient force is applied to it .
A No@@ k@@ ia 3@@ 3@@ 10 .
Specifically , is it already in force ?
This jo@@ ke is being made in every discussion .
I have decided to count them .
This is the fourth jo@@ ke on the pl@@ age I read in the comments today .
It is difficult to understand how a proto@@ type can be distributed like that .
Before specific software is inst@@ alled , one can imagine that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain and it is hard to see how it could come back .
Therefore , h@@ um@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ m ... ... ... ... ... ... ? ? ? ? .
The most likely thing is that it is a production unit on which the I@@ O@@ S has not been properly inst@@ alled and is therefore stuck with the plant test code established .
I do not know how they are doing this .
But would they put test software on everyone ?
The photo@@ graph@@ s on E@@ bas@@ y clearly show the lack of F@@ C@@ C or EC lo@@ go and the presence of a proto@@ type tra@@ der .
The b@@ ob@@ o article par excellence .
We want cheap products , and are we surprised that industri@@ alists produce an “ industry , ” but all the teachers and small trade are concerned about how good , bi@@ o p@@ a@@ c € 16@@ 50 ( average wage ) ?
But in response to your post , if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary .
After everyone is free to put his priorities where he sees fit .
For my part , food is one .
G@@ o me without any hesitation .
It is known as b@@ ob@@ os , or better b@@ ob@@ ec@@ o , people who see the world through ideological “ software ” that leads them to dis@@ connect themselves from reality .
It is the total thin@@ k-@@ together .
They are expert experts , for example , claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a show@@ er .
They are also expert experts , joining the lef@@ to@@ vers , which they sometimes come from , for example by condemning CO2 emissions while at the same time passing their holidays to the Mal@@ di@@ ves .
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not bear this mix@@ ture of excessive ideology and tar@@ tu@@ m , as well as being surprised to often meet criticism of them .
W@@ ath , thank you for this full and comprehensive the@@ ori@@ zation , and for all the associated details ( aeroplan@@ es , doub@@ ters … ) .
I would like to be part of that , but I do not find myself .
The concept is not so complicated .
The b@@ ust is mon@@ ob@@ lo@@ c .
Do you understand the concept of g@@ au@@ -@@ can@@ ry ?
Well , you are able to understand the concept of b@@ ob@@ ec@@ o .
It is perfect copy .
The classification would be more complicated if we were to be interested in the eco@@ lo@@ s .
The b@@ ob@@ ec@@ o is part of it , but it is only the most visible part of the eco@@ lo@@ s , because it is the one that fe@@ eds the media .
This is a fine gi@@ ra@@ t .
Ap@@ parently , no one wants to look at this game .
It is so bad that it looks like a female n@@ u .
C@@ all , you are alongside the pl@@ ate .
We must be part of the micro@@ co@@ s@@ m to understand the stun@@ ning beau@@ ty of this work .
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not spent countless decades studying and pl@@ agu@@ ing major artists .
What is important is not the fact that E@@ mi@@ n does not know and seems obs@@ essed with the same subject .
What is important is that it really has managed to become a great rich and famous with no artistic capacity .
It is not art .
No , it is a pig .
The fact that E@@ mi@@ in does not know how to draw it up
This is not really a proven fact .
Rather , it is an opinion .
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic re@@ produc@@ tions of dogs that smoke by playing the b@@ ill@@ board .
Pro@@ vi@@ ding art may be problematic , but not in that case .
It is much more than just representing the real .
If you do not look for this , a cam@@ era will take the case .
The author also talks about the ex@@ es@@ sion@@ ism of E@@ mi@@ in .
Let us look again and let the image speak for itself , without compar@@ ing it with the kind of design you might like .
If so , why do you not do so yourself ?
There is still a need for savings : equi@@ ties , the number of Republican guard hor@@ ses or the status of generals who are no longer active ... .
The truth is that France is reducing its workforce , but as all countries have done , sometimes even more dramatically , starting with Great Britain .
It is only half encouraging ...
Oper@@ ation without support quickly finds its limits !
A peculi@@ ar approach , at a time when we are seeing the weaknesses and shortcomings of our defence tool , particularly in the Sa@@ hel .
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned , which lose a dimension of their activities , or even part of their history .
Where is the promised sec@@ tor@@ isation ?
4.@@ ed@@ mon@@ d : that is what I said , look elsewhere where saving , but especially not at home , is really not possible .
That is exactly what you are proposing to do , looking elsewhere where there is certain rub@@ b@@ ish .
Let all those who have sat on the military side dare to come here and tell us that there is no money wasted in this per@@ im@@ e@@ ter and that is not the case ...
Let us apply the same po@@ tion to the public service as a whole and public finances will go a little better .
And for Jo@@ si : look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries , and you will understand why defense can be a little charged !
Ben yes , the economies on which everyone agrees that they must be done , must it be seen somewhere , not ?
Man@@ lic of po@@ t , those on whom it falls to murder when it comes home , the poor cher@@ ish .
But , above all , it does not leave me because , in this case , it is a crime and not an economy .
It is going !
What is the closure of the V@@ al de Gra@@ ce going to weaken our defence tool in the Sa@@ hel ?
As for local authorities , history is repeated in every closure of post , maternity , hospital and c@@ at .
Everyone is , of course , for economies .
It is bizarre , an U@@ M@@ P may@@ or who wants compensation and does not welcome the savings made in public spending .
This article is really the most ast@@ ounding thing I have ever read !
This embarrassing moment in which the first three people who commit themselves make the same bad jo@@ ke .
It is the de@@ pres@@ s@@ ment to b@@ ail out its Fac@@ e@@ book thre@@ thre@@ k and to see that 80 % of its friends began their stat@@ utes by the phrase &apos; this embarrassing moment &apos; .
I believe they will make it a film .
He will surely base himself on a mo@@ ck@@ ery , where someone is d@@ row@@ ning on his or her ex day in the bus by going to work and only seeing where his tw@@ in has returned .
It is not embarrassing , it is completely c@@ on .
Not really , in my view , the author is taking the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bur@@ y his emotions and to tighten his te@@ eth .
I am sure that if you are a f@@ an of K@@ ate Bush , the announcement of his return on the scene after 25 years of absence has been strong .
You realise that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have rights ?
I do not have the Internet .
So I do not think I can comment .
Do not have a computer .
My God has to go to the film before I die !
I do not believe that this article is the most incredible form I have ever read !
Char@@ lie really has shown that it is at the top of the summit of the co@@ sm@@ ic uni@@ verse that is sa@@ ti@@ ric@@ al journ@@ alism !
I would like to go into the reverse !
It is absolutely essential that I share all my friends on Fac@@ e@@ book and T@@ wit@@ ter so that they finally have ill@@ um@@ inating and discover the incredible hy@@ pe and the insur@@ moun@@ table gen@@ i@@ us that h@@ its Mr Bro@@ o@@ ker &apos;s gre@@ er .
Well , it was really zero .
Above all , if it is not women , or the v@@ ines .
I am a par@@ as@@ ite .
This shows a positive change in democracies : the rise of regional policies and effective voluntary initiatives .
So far , we are confisc@@ ating the right to save our planet by states that are playing the crow@@ ds in every corner to save the planet .
We are therefore deciding to take things in hand .
Together with the Commissioner they have pl@@ anted for energy , all these fine recommendations have got bo@@ gged down ..@@ .@@ .
Tra@@ ffic@@ king : E@@ oli@@ an and solar farms are tomorrow ’ s R@@ ons .
This is funded by the cu@@ ri@@ ble .
Please stop this pro-@@ nuclear speech .
Pol@@ lu@@ tion is not limited to CO2 .
radio@@ activity is much more damaging in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident .
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety , it is better to confine itself to laboratories .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able energy is our only sal@@ vation , provided of course that we drastically reduce our consumption .
R@@ ene@@ w@@ able electricity to combat CO2 emissions ?
France is in no way concerned .
Nuclear power is zero CO2 emissions to production and ep@@ sil@@ sil@@ on for other stages .
Elec@@ tr@@ icity through wind or P@@ V is already more than G@@ ES on other stages and , above all , gas , or worse coal as in Germany , to compensate for inter@@ mit@@ tent .
Re@@ placing nuclear energy through wind or P@@ V would run counter to the fight against CO2 .
Christian , I am not insul@@ ting you , I am a state Do@@ c@@ tor in physical science 198@@ 1 , I have carried out research into nuclear physi@@ cs , I challenge you to prove contrary to what I said .
For what I did not say , I did not say anything about Germany , in fact you did not respond to what I said and like all right-wing people dem@@ ol@@ ishing the interlocu@@ tor I never do so .
I would also mention the conclusion of experts from the German Government : Germany ’ s current renewable energy programme is an un@@ profitable and inefficient way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and should be stopped .
0 emissions if you do not include uranium extraction and construction , and if you do not count the greenhouse gas ste@@ am less than Co@@ 2 , it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is water ste@@ am and a little in river water .
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a &apos; giant of South Asia &apos; ... ! ! ! !
Last time , Pakistan won against H@@ un@@ stan .
It does not surprise me , most Indi@@ ans who make comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan .
In fact it shows your spirit .
It would have been the same if they had described South Asia &apos;s giant India ...
I have nothing against some Pakistani players participating , but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable .
It would simply open a P@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box full of corruption and ma@@ fia .
With regard to the I@@ SL , today &apos;s opening match has been surprisingly interesting , with K@@ ol@@ ti@@ tic@@ o in K@@ k@@ ata imposing 3-@@ 0 against M@@ um@@ ba@@ i .
Pakistan still has a long way to go .
Com@@ pared with the billions and billions that India spends on the I@@ PL and now football , how could we ever compete with our &apos; no@@ is@@ y neighbours &apos; ...
The race for the cheap co@@ lo@@ t is paying for .
This is a pity for such a beautiful project .
In the case of the incident , the possible design defec@@ t is only too cold .
So perhaps we are not in a design defec@@ t , but in implementation ...
Unlike ari@@ d , a private company , it seems that ot@@ y@@ z belongs to the Russian state ...
And if the rule is the same as the state is its own insu@@ rer .
They are likely to pay the satell@@ ites into fri@@ g@@ ates who know .
This is all the more unfortunate given that many media are re@@ treating the only ti@@ t@@ les of articles - and many read@@ ers only retain these securities .
This creates a false impression against the content of the article itself .
I fully agree with you that the title is not appropriate and that it un@@ fairly calls into question the project .
